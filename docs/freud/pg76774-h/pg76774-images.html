<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">When one has lived for long within a
particular culture<a id="r1"></a><a class="c007 pginternal" href="#f1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and has often
striven to discover its origins and the
path of its development, one feels for once the
temptation to turn one’s attention in the other
direction and to ask what further fate awaits this
culture and what transformations it is destined
to undergo. But one soon finds that the value
of such an enquiry is diminished from the outset
by several considerations. Above all, by the fact
that there are only a few people who can survey
human activity in all its ramifications. Most
people have been compelled to restrict themselves
to a single, or to a few, spheres of interest; but the
less a man knows of the past and the present the
more unreliable must his judgement of the future
prove. And further it is precisely in the matter
<span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>of this judgement that the subjective expectations
of the individual play a part that is difficult to
assess; for these prove to be dependent on purely
personal factors in his own experience, on his more
or less hopeful attitude to life, according as
temperament, success or failure has prescribed for
him. And finally one must take into account the
remarkable fact that in general men experience
the present naïvely, so to speak, without being
able to estimate its content; they must first place
it at a distance, <em>i.e.</em> the present must have become
the past before one can win from it points of
vantage from which to gauge the future.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="f1">
<p class="c008"><a href="#r1" class="pginternal">1</a>. The German word <em>Kultur</em> has been translated sometimes
as ‘culture’ and sometimes as ‘civilization’, denoting as it does
a concept intermediate between these and at times inclusive of
both.—<span class="sc">Ed.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="c008">And so he who yields to the temptation to
deliver an opinion on the probable future of our
culture will do well to remind himself of the difficulties
just indicated, and likewise of the uncertainty
that attaches quite universally to every
prophecy. It follows from this that in hasty flight
from so great a task I shall seek out the small
tract of territory to which my attention has hitherto
been directed, as soon as I have defined its position
in general.</p>

<p class="c008">Human culture—I mean by that all those
respects in which human life has raised itself above
animal conditions and in which it differs from the
life of the beasts, and I disdain to separate culture
<span class="pageno" id="Page_9">9</span>and civilization—presents, as is well known, two
aspects to the observer. It includes on the one
hand all the knowledge and power that men have
acquired in order to master the forces of nature
and win resources from her for the satisfaction of
human needs; and on the other hand it includes
all the necessary arrangements whereby men’s
relations to each other, and in particular the
distribution of the attainable riches, may be
regulated. The two tendencies of culture are not
independent of each other, first, because the mutual
relations of men are profoundly influenced by the
measure of instinctual satisfaction that the existing
resources make possible; secondly, because the
individual can himself take on the quality of a
piece of property in his relation to another, in so
far as this other makes use of his capacity for work
or chooses him as sexual object; and thirdly,
because every individual is virtually an enemy of
culture, which is nevertheless ostensibly an object
of universal human concern. It is remarkable
that little as men are able to exist in isolation they
should yet feel as a heavy burden the sacrifices
that culture expects of them in order that a communal
existence may be possible. Thus culture
must be defended against the individual, and its
organization, its institutions and its laws, are all
<span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>directed to this end; they aim not only at establishing
a certain distribution of property, but also
at maintaining it; in fact, they must protect
against the hostile impulses of mankind everything
that contributes to the conquest of nature and
the production of wealth. Human creations are
easy to destroy, and science and technical skill,
which have built them up, can also be turned to
their destruction.</p>

<p class="c008">So one gets the impression that culture is something
which was imposed on a resisting majority
by a minority that understood how to possess
itself of the means of power and coercion. Of
course it stands to reason that these difficulties
are not inherent in the nature of culture itself,
but are conditioned by the imperfections of the
cultural forms that have so far been developed.
Indeed it is not difficult to point out these defects.
While mankind has made solid advances in the
conquest of nature and may expect to make still
greater ones, no certain claim can be established
for a corresponding advance in the regulation
of human affairs, and probably at every period,
as again now, many men have asked themselves
whether this fragment that has been acquired by
culture is indeed worth defending at all. One
might suppose that a reorganization of human
<span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>relations should be possible, which, by abandoning
coercion and the suppression of the instincts,
would remove the sources of dissatisfaction with
culture, so that undisturbed by inner conflict men
might devote themselves to the acquisition of
natural resources and to the enjoyment of the same.
That would be the golden age, but it is questionable
if such a state of affairs can ever be realized. It
seems more probable that every culture must be
built up on coercion and instinctual renunciation;
it does not even appear certain that without
coercion the majority of human individuals would
be ready to submit to the labour necessary for
acquiring new means of supporting life. One
has, I think, to reckon with the fact that there
are present in all men destructive, and therefore
anti-social and anti-cultural, tendencies, and that
with a great number of people these are strong
enough to determine their behaviour in human
society.</p>

<p class="c008">This psychological fact acquires a decisive
significance when one is forming an estimate of
human culture. One thought at first that the
essence of culture lay in the conquest of nature
for the means of supporting life, and in eliminating
the dangers that threaten culture by the suitable
distribution of these among mankind, but now the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_12">12</span>emphasis seems to have shifted away from the
material plane on to the psychical. The critical
question is whether and to what extent one can
succeed, first, in diminishing the burden of the
instinctual sacrifices imposed on men; secondly,
in reconciling them to those that must necessarily
remain; and thirdly, in compensating them for
these. It is just as impossible to do without
government of the masses by a minority as it is to
dispense with coercion in the work of civilization,
for the masses are lazy and unintelligent, they have
no love for instinctual renunciation, they are not
to be convinced of its inevitability by argument,
and the individuals support each other in giving
full play to their unruliness. It is only by the
influence of individuals who can set an example,
whom the masses recognize as their leaders, that
they can be induced to submit to the labours and
renunciations on which the existence of culture
depends. All is well if these leaders are people
of superior insight into what constitute the
necessities of life, people who have attained the
height of mastering their own instinctual wishes.
But the danger exists that in order not to lose
their influence they will yield to the masses more
than these will yield to them, and therefore it
seems necessary that they should be independent
<span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span>of the masses by having at their disposal means
of enforcing their authority. To put it briefly,
there are two widely diffused human characteristics
which are responsible for the fact that the organization
of culture can be maintained only by a
certain measure of coercion: that is to say, men
are not naturally fond of work, and arguments are
of no avail against their passions.</p>

<p class="c008">I know what objections will be brought against
these arguments. It will be said that the character
of the masses, here delineated, which is
supposed to prove that one cannot dispense with
coercion in the work of civilization, is itself only
the result of defective cultural organization, through
which men have become embittered, revengeful
and unapproachable. New generations, brought
up kindly and taught to have a respect for reason,
who have experienced the benefits of culture early
in life, will have a different attitude towards it;
they will feel it to be their very own possession,
and they will be ready on its account to make the
sacrifice in labour and in instinctual renunciation
that is necessary for its preservation. They will
be able to do without coercion and will differ little
from their leaders. If no culture has so far produced
human masses of such a quality, it is due
to the fact that no culture has yet discovered the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>plan that will influence men in such a way, and
that from childhood on.</p>

<p class="c008">It may be doubted whether it is possible at all,
or at any rate just now, in the present stage of our
conquest of nature, to establish a cultural organization
of this kind; it may be asked where the throng
of superior, dependable and disinterested leaders,
who are to act as educators of the future generations,
are to come from; and one may be appalled
at the stupendous amount of force that will be
unavoidable if these intentions are to be carried
out. But one cannot deny the grandeur of this
project and its significance for the future of human
culture. It is securely based on a piece of psychological
insight, on the fact that man is equipped
with the most varied instinctual predispositions,
the ultimate course of which is determined by the
experiences of early childhood. But the limitations
of man’s capacity for education set bounds
to the efficacy of such a cultural transformation.
One may question whether and in what degree it
would be possible for another cultural milieu to
efface the two characteristics of human masses
that make the guidance of men’s affairs so very
difficult. The experiment has not yet been made.
Probably a certain percentage of mankind—owing
to morbid predisposition or too great instinctual
<span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>vigour—will always remain asocial, but if only one
can succeed in reducing to a minority the majority
that is to-day hostile to culture, one will have
accomplished a great deal, perhaps indeed everything
that can be accomplished.</p>

<p class="c008">I should not like to give the impression that I
have wandered far away from the chosen path of
my enquiry. I will therefore expressly assert that
it is far from my intention to estimate the value
of the great cultural experiment that is at present
in progress in the vast country that stretches
between Europe and Asia. I have neither the
special knowledge nor the capacity to decide on
its practicability, to test the expediency of the
methods employed, or to measure the width of
the inevitable gulf between intention and execution.
What is there in course of preparation
eludes investigation, for which it is not ready; for
this our long consolidated culture presents the
material.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">We have glided unawares out of the
economic plane over into the psychological.
At first we were tempted to
seek the essence of culture in the existing material
resources and in the arrangements for their distribution.
But with the discovery that every
culture is based on compulsory labour and instinctual
renunciation, and that it therefore inevitably
evokes opposition from those affected by
these demands, it became clear that the resources
themselves, the means of acquiring them, and the
arrangements for their distribution could not be
its essential or unique characteristic; for they are
threatened by the rebelliousness and destructive
passions of the members of the culture. Thus
in addition to the resources there are the means
of defending culture: the coercive measures, and
others that are intended to reconcile men to it
and to recompense them for their sacrifices. And
these last may be described as the psychical sphere
of culture.</p>

<p class="c008"><span class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span>For the sake of a uniform terminology we will
describe the fact that an instinct cannot be satisfied
as ‘frustration’, the means by which this frustration
is secured as ‘prohibition’, and the condition
produced by the prohibition as ‘privation’. Then
the next step is to distinguish between privations
that do affect everybody and those that do not,
those that merely affect groups, classes, or even
individuals. The former are the oldest; with
the prohibitions that cause them culture began,
who knows how many thousands of years ago, to
detach itself from the primordial animal condition
of mankind. To our surprise we have found that
they are still operative, that they still form the
kernel of the hostility to culture. The instinctual
wishes that suffer under them are born anew with
every child; there is a class of men, the neurotics,
who react already to this first group of frustrations
by an asocial attitude. Such instinctual
wishes are those of incest, of cannibalism, and of
murder. It seems strange to classify these, in
repudiating which all men seem to be at one, with
those others, about whose permissibility or impermissibility
in our culture there is so vigorous
a dispute; but psychologically one is justified in
doing this. Nor is the attitude of culture to these
oldest instinctual wishes the same in each case;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>cannibalism alone seems to be proscribed by everyone,
and—to other than analytic observation—completely
overcome; the strength of the incest
wishes can still be perceived behind the prohibition;
and under certain conditions murder is still
practised, indeed enjoined, by our culture. It
is possible that cultural developments lie before us,
in which yet other wish-gratifications, which are
to-day entirely permissible, will appear just as
disagreeable as those of cannibalism do now.</p>

<p class="c008">Already in these earliest instinctual renunciations
a psychological factor is involved, which
remains of great importance for everything that
follows. It is not true to say that the human
mind has undergone no development since the
earliest times and that in contrast to the advances
of science and technical skill it is still the same to-day
as at the beginning of history. We can point
out one of these advances here. It is in accordance
with the course of our development that
external compulsion is gradually internalized, in
that a special mental function, man’s super-ego,
takes it under its jurisdiction. Every child presents
to us the model of this transformation; it is only
by that means that it becomes a moral and social
being. This strengthening of the super-ego is a
highly valuable psychological possession for culture.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>Those people in whom it has taken place, from
being the foes of culture, become its supporters.
The greater their number in a cultural community,
the more secure it is and the more easily can it
dispense with external coercion. Now the degree
of this internalization differs widely in the case of
each instinctual prohibition. As far as the earliest
demands of culture, already mentioned, are concerned,
the process of internalization seems to
have been to a great extent accomplished, if we
leave out of account the unwelcome exception of
the neurotics. But the case is altered when we
turn to the other instinctual claims. One notes
with surprise and concern that a majority of men
obey the cultural prohibitions in question only
under the pressure of external force, in fact only
where the latter can assert itself and for as long
as it is an object of fear. This also holds good
for those so-called moral cultural demands, which
in the same way apply to everyone. The greater
part of what one experiences of man’s moral
untrustworthiness is to be explained in this connection.
There are innumerable civilized people
who would shrink from murder or incest, and who
yet do not hesitate to gratify their avarice, their
aggressiveness and their sexual lusts, and who have
no compunction in hurting others by lying, fraud
<span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span>and calumny, so long as they remain unpunished
for it; and no doubt this has been so for many
cultural epochs.</p>

<p class="c008">If we turn to those restrictions that only apply
to certain classes of society, we encounter a state
of things which is glaringly obvious and has
always been recognized. It is to be expected that
the neglected classes will grudge the favoured
ones their privileges and that they will do everything
in their power to rid themselves of their
own surplus of privation. Where this is not
possible a lasting measure of discontent will obtain
within this culture, and this may lead to dangerous
outbreaks. But if a culture has not got beyond
the stage in which the satisfaction of one group
of its members necessarily involves the suppression
of another, perhaps the majority—and this is the
case in all modern cultures,—it is intelligible that
these suppressed classes should develop an intense
hostility to the culture; a culture, whose existence
they make possible by their labour, but in whose
resources they have too small a share. In such
conditions one must not expect to find an internalization
of the cultural prohibitions among
the suppressed classes; indeed they are not even
prepared to acknowledge these prohibitions, intent,
as they are, on the destruction of the culture itself
<span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>and perhaps even of the assumptions on which
it rests. These classes are so manifestly hostile
to culture that on that account the more latent
hostility of the better provided social strata has
been overlooked. It need not be said that a
culture which leaves unsatisfied and drives to
rebelliousness so large a number of its members
neither has a prospect of continued existence, nor
deserves it.</p>

<p class="c008">The extent to which cultural rules have been
internalized—to express it popularly and unpsychologically:
the moral level of the members—is
not the only psychical asset to be considered
if one is estimating the value of a culture. In
addition there is its heritage of ideals and artistic
creations, that is to say, of the satisfactions they
both yield.</p>

<p class="c008">One will be only too readily inclined to include
among the psychical possessions of a culture its
ideals, that is, its judgements of what are its
loftiest and its most ambitious accomplishments.
It seems at first as if these ideals would determine
the achievements of the cultural group; but
the actual process would seem to be that the
ideals are modelled on the first achievements that
the co-operation of internal ability and external
circumstances made possible, and that now these
<span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>first achievements are merely held fast by the
ideal as examples to be followed. The satisfaction
the ideal gives to the members of the culture is
thus of a narcissistic nature, it is based on pride
in what has already been successfully achieved.
To make this satisfaction complete the culture
compares itself with others which have applied
themselves to other tasks and have developed
other ideals. On the strength of these differences
every culture claims the right to despise the rest.
In this way cultural ideals become a source of
discord and enmity between different cultural
groups, as can be most clearly seen among nations.</p>

<p class="c008">The narcissistic satisfaction provided by the
cultural ideal is also one of the forces that effectively
counteract the hostility to culture within
the cultural group. It can be shared not only
by the favoured classes, which enjoy the benefits
of this culture, but also by the suppressed, since
the right to despise those that are outside it
compensates them for the wrongs they suffer in
their own group. True, one is a miserable plebeian,
tormented by obligations and military service,
but withal one is a Roman citizen, one has one’s
share in the task of ruling other nations and
dictating their laws. This identification of the
suppressed with the class that governs and exploits
<span class="pageno" id="Page_23">23</span>them is, however, only a part of a larger whole.
Thus the former can be attached affectively to
the latter; in spite of their animosity they can
find their ideals in their masters. Unless such
relations, fundamentally of a satisfying kind, were
in existence, it would be impossible to understand
how so many cultures have contrived to exist for
so long in spite of the justified hostility of great
masses of men.</p>

<p class="c008">Different in kind is the satisfaction that art
yields to the members of a cultural group. As a
rule it remains inaccessible to the masses, who are
engaged in exhausting labour and who have not
enjoyed the benefits of individual education. As
we have long known, art offers substitutive
gratifications for the oldest cultural renunciations,
still always most deeply felt, and for that reason
serves like nothing else to reconcile men to the
sacrifices they have made on culture’s behalf.
On the other hand, works of art promote the
feelings of identification, of which every cultural
group has so much need, in the occasion they
provide for the sharing of highly valued emotional
experiences. And when they represent the achievements
of a particular culture, thus in an impressive
way recalling it to its ideals, they also subserve
a narcissistic gratification.</p>

<p class="c008"><span class="pageno" id="Page_24">24</span>No mention has yet been made of what is
perhaps the most important part of the psychical
inventory of a culture: that is to say, its—in the
broadest sense—religious ideas; in other words,
the use of which will be justified later, its illusions.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_25">25</span>
  <h2 class="c005">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">Wherein lies the peculiar value of
religious ideas?</p>

<p class="c008">We have spoken of the hostility to
culture, produced by the pressure it exercises and
the instinctual renunciations that it demands.
If one imagined its prohibitions removed, then
one could choose any woman who took one’s fancy
as one’s sexual object, one could kill without
hesitation one’s rival or whoever interfered with
one in any other way, and one could seize what
one wanted of another man’s goods without asking
his leave: how splendid, what a succession of
delights, life would be! True, one soon finds the
first difficulty: everyone else has exactly the
same wishes, and will treat one with no more
consideration than one will treat him. And so
in reality there is only one single person who can
be made unrestrictedly happy by abolishing thus
the restrictions imposed by culture, and that is
a tyrant or dictator who has monopolized all the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_26">26</span>means of power; and even he has every reason
to want the others to keep at least one cultural
commandment: thou shalt not kill.</p>

<p class="c008">But how ungrateful, how short-sighted after all,
to strive for the abolition of culture! What would
then remain would be the state of nature, and that
is far harder to endure. It is true that nature
does not ask us to restrain our instincts, she lets
us do as we like; but she has her peculiarly
effective mode of restricting us: she destroys us,
coldly, cruelly, callously, as it seems to us, and
possibly just through what has caused our satisfaction.
It was because of these very dangers
with which nature threatens us that we united
together and created culture, which, amongst
other things, is supposed to make our communal
existence possible. Indeed, it is the principal
task of culture, its real <em>raison d’être</em>, to defend us
against nature.</p>

<p class="c008">One must confess that in many ways it already
does this tolerably well, and clearly as time goes
on it will be much more successful. But no one
is under the illusion that nature has so far been
vanquished; few dare to hope that she will ever
be completely under man’s subjection. There
are the elements, which seem to mock at all human
control: the earth, which quakes, is rent asunder,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>and buries man and all his works; the water,
which in tumult floods and submerges all things;
the storm, which drives all before it; there are the
diseases, which we have only lately recognized
as the attacks of other living creatures; and
finally there is the painful riddle of death, for
which no remedy at all has yet been found, nor
probably ever will be. With these forces nature
rises up before us, sublime, pitiless, inexorable;
thus she brings again to mind our weakness and
helplessness, of which we thought the work of
civilization had rid us. It is one of the few noble
and gratifying spectacles that men can offer, when
in the face of an elemental catastrophe they awake
from their muddle and confusion, forget all their
internal difficulties and animosities, and remember
the great common task, the preservation of mankind
against the supremacy of nature.</p>

<p class="c008">For the individual, as for mankind in general,
life is hard to endure. The culture in which he
shares imposes on him some measure of privation,
and other men occasion him a certain degree of
suffering, either in spite of the laws of this culture
or because of its imperfections. Add to this the
evils that unvanquished nature—he calls it Fate—inflicts
on him. One would expect a permanent
condition of anxious suspense and a severe injury
<span class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span>to his innate narcissism to be the result of this state
of affairs. We know already how the individual
reacts to the injuries that culture and other men
inflict on him: he develops a corresponding degree
of resistance against the institutions of this culture,
of hostility towards it. But how does he defend
himself against the supremacy of nature, of fate,
which threatens him, as it threatens all?</p>

<p class="c008">Culture relieves him of this task: it performs
it in the same way for everyone. (It is also
noteworthy that pretty well all cultures are the
same in this respect.) It does not cry a halt, as
it were, in its task of defending man against
nature; it merely pursues it by other methods.
This is a complex business; man’s seriously
menaced self-esteem craves for consolation, life
and the universe must be rid of their terrors, and
incidentally man’s curiosity, reinforced, it is true,
by the strongest practical motives, demands an
answer.</p>

<p class="c008">With the first step, which is the humanization
of nature, much is already won. Nothing can be
made of impersonal forces and fates; they remain
eternally remote. But if the elements have passions
that rage like those in our own souls, if death
itself is not something spontaneous, but the violent
act of an evil Will, if everywhere in nature we
<span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>have about us beings who resemble those of our
own environment, then indeed we can breathe
freely, we can feel at home in face of the supernatural,
and we can deal psychically with our
frantic anxiety. We are perhaps still defenceless,
but no longer helplessly paralysed; we can at
least react; perhaps indeed we are not even defenceless,
we can have recourse to the same methods
against these violent supermen of the beyond that
we make use of in our own community; we can try
to exorcise them, to appease them, to bribe them,
and so rob them of part of their power by thus
influencing them. Such a substitution of psychology
for natural science provides not merely
immediate relief, it also points the way to a
further mastery of the situation.</p>

<p class="c008">For there is nothing new in this situation. It
has an infantile prototype, and is really only the
continuation of this. For once before one has
been in such a state of helplessness: as a little
child in one’s relationship to one’s parents. For
one had reason to fear them, especially the father,
though at the same time one was sure of his
protection against the dangers then known to one.
And so it was natural to assimilate and combine
the two situations. Here, too, as in dream-life,
the wish came into its own. The sleeper is seized
<span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>by a presentiment of death, which seeks to carry
him to the grave. But the dream-work knows
how to select a condition that will turn even this
dreaded event into a wish-fulfilment: the dreamer
sees himself in an ancient Etruscan grave, into
which he has descended, happy in the satisfaction
it has given to his archæological interests. Similarly
man makes the forces of nature not simply
in the image of men with whom he can associate
as his equals—that would not do justice to the
overpowering impression they make on him—but
he gives them the characteristics of the father,
makes them into gods, thereby following not only
an infantile, but also, as I have tried to show, a
phylogenetic prototype.</p>

<p class="c008">In the course of time the first observations of
law and order in natural phenomena are made,
and therewith the forces of nature lose their
human traits. But men’s helplessness remains,
and with it their father-longing and the gods.
The gods retain their threefold task: they must
exorcise the terrors of nature, they must reconcile
one to the cruelty of fate, particularly as shown
in death, and they must make amends for the
sufferings and privations that the communal life
of culture has imposed on man.</p>

<p class="c008">But within these there is a gradual shifting of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>the accent. It is observed that natural phenomena
develop of themselves from inward necessity;
without doubt the gods are the lords of nature:
they have arranged it thus and now they can
leave it to itself. Only occasionally, in the so-called
miracles, do they intervene in its course, as
if to protest that they have surrendered nothing
of their original sphere of power. As far as the
vicissitudes of fate are concerned, an unpleasant
suspicion persists that the perplexity and helplessness
of the human race cannot be remedied.
This is where the gods are most apt to fail us; if
they themselves make fate, then their ways must
be deemed inscrutable. The most gifted people
of the ancient world dimly surmised that above
the gods stands Destiny and that the gods themselves
have their destinies. And the more autonomous
nature becomes and the more the gods
withdraw from her, the more earnestly are all
expectations concentrated on the third task assigned
to them and the more does morality become
their real domain. It now becomes the business of
the gods to adjust the defects and evils of culture,
to attend to the sufferings that men inflict on each
other in their communal life, and to see that the
laws of culture, which men obey so ill, are carried
out. The laws of culture themselves are claimed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_32">32</span>to be of divine origin, they are elevated to a
position above human society, and they are
extended over nature and the universe.</p>

<p class="c008">And so a rich store of ideas is formed, born of
the need to make tolerable the helplessness of
man, and built out of the material offered by
memories of the helplessness of his own childhood
and the childhood of the human race. It is easy to
see that these ideas protect man in two directions;
against the dangers of nature and fate, and against
the evils of human society itself. What it amounts
to is this: life in this world serves a higher purpose;
true, it is not easy to guess the nature of
this purpose, but certainly a perfecting of human
existence is implied. Probably the spiritual part
of man, the soul, which in the course of time has
so slowly and unwillingly detached itself from the
body, is to be regarded as the object of this
elevation and exaltation. Everything that takes
place in this world expresses the intentions of
an Intelligence, superior to us, which in the
end, though its devious ways may be difficult to
follow, orders everything for good, that is, to
our advantage. Over each one of us watches a
benevolent, and only apparently severe, Providence,
which will not suffer us to become the
plaything of the stark and pitiless forces of nature;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>death itself is not annihilation, not a return to
inorganic lifelessness, but the beginning of a new
kind of existence, which lies on the road of
development to something higher. And to turn
to the other side of the question, the moral
laws that have formed our culture govern also
the whole universe, only they are upheld with
incomparably more force and consistency by a
supreme judicial court. In the end all good is
rewarded, all evil punished, if not actually in this
life, then in the further existences that begin after
death. And thus all the terrors, the sufferings,
and the hardships of life are destined to be
obliterated; the life after death, which continues
our earthly existence as the invisible part of the
spectrum adjoins the visible, brings all the perfection
that perhaps we have missed here. And
the superior wisdom that directs this issue, the
supreme goodness that expresses itself thus, the
justice that thus achieves its aim—these are the
qualities of the divine beings who have fashioned
us and the world in general; or rather of the one
divine being into which in our culture all the gods
of antiquity have been condensed. The race that
first succeeded in thus concentrating the divine
qualities was not a little proud of this advance.
It had revealed the father nucleus which had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span>always lain hidden behind every divine figure;
fundamentally it was a return to the historical
beginnings of the idea of God. Now that God
was a single person, man’s relations to him could
recover the intimacy and intensity of the child’s
relation to the father. If one had done so much
for the father, then surely one would be rewarded—at
least the only beloved child, the chosen people,
would be. More recently, pious America has laid
claim to be ‘God’s own country’, and for one of
the forms under which men worship the deity the
claim certainly holds good.</p>

<p class="c008">The religious ideas that have just been summarized
have of course gone through a long
process of development, and have been held in
various phases by various cultures. I have singled
out one such phase of development, which more
or less corresponds to the final form of our contemporary
Christian culture in the west. It is
easy to see that not all the parts of this whole
tally equally well with each other, that not all
the questions that press for an answer receive
one, and that the contradiction of daily experience
can only with difficulty be dismissed. But such as
they are, these ideas—religious, in the broadest
sense of the word—are prized as the most precious
possession of culture, as the most valuable thing
<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>it has to offer its members; far more highly
prized than all our devices for winning the treasures
of the earth, for providing men with sustenance,
or for preventing their diseases, and so forth;
men suppose that life would be intolerable if they
did not accord these ideas the value that is claimed
for them. And now the question arises: what
are these ideas in the light of psychology; whence
do they derive the esteem in which they are held;
and further, in all diffidence, what is their real
worth?</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>
  <h2 class="c005">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">An enquiry that proceeds uninterruptedly,
like a monologue, is not altogether without
its dangers. One is too easily tempted to
push aside thoughts that would interrupt it, and
in exchange one is left with a feeling of uncertainty
which one will drown in the end by over-decisiveness.
I shall therefore imagine an opponent who
follows my arguments with mistrust, and I shall
let him interject remarks here and there.</p>

<p class="c008">I hear him saying: ‘You have repeatedly used
the expressions “culture creates these religious
ideas”, “culture places them at the disposal of
its members”, which sounds strange to me somehow.
I could not say why myself, but it does
not sound so natural as to say that culture has
made regulations about distributing the products of
labour or about the rights over women and children.’</p>

<p class="c008">I think, nevertheless, that one is justified in
expressing oneself thus. I have tried to show that
religious ideas have sprung from the same need
<span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>as all the other achievements of culture: from the
necessity for defending itself against the crushing
supremacy of nature. And there was a second
motive: the eager desire to correct the so painfully
felt imperfections of culture. Moreover,
there is something particularly apposite in saying
that culture gives the individual these ideas, for
he finds them at hand, they are presented to him
ready-made; he would not be in a position to
find them by himself. It is the heritage of many
generations which he enters into and which he
takes over as he does the multiplication table,
geometry, etc. There is certainly a distinction in
this, but it lies elsewhere, and I cannot examine it
at this point. The feeling of strangeness that you
mention may be partly accounted for by the fact
that this stock of religious ideas is generally offered
as a divine revelation. But that is in itself a part
of the religious system, and entirely leaves out of
account the known historical development of these
ideas and their variations in different ages and
cultures.</p>

<p class="c008">‘Another point which seems to me more
important. You would derive the humanization
of nature from the desire to put an end to human
perplexity and helplessness in the face of nature’s
dreaded forces, and from the necessity for establishing
<span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>relations with, and finally influencing, these
forces. But this explanation seems to be superfluous.
For primitive man has no choice, he has
no other way of thinking. It is natural to him,
as if innate, to project his existence outwards into
the world, and to regard all events that come under
his observation as the manifestations of beings
who fundamentally resemble himself. It is his
only method of comprehension. And it is by no
means self-evident, on the contrary it is a remarkable
coincidence, that he should succeed in satisfying
one of his great wants by thus indulging his
natural disposition.’</p>

<p class="c008">I do not find that so striking. For do you
suppose that men’s thought-processes have no
practical motives, that they are simply the expression
of a disinterested curiosity? That is surely
very improbable. I believe, rather, that when he
personifies the forces of nature man is once again
following an infantile prototype. He has learnt
from the persons of his earliest environment that
the way to influence them is to establish a relationship
with them, and so, later on, with the same
end in view, he deals with everything that happens
to him as he dealt with those persons. Thus I
do not contradict your descriptive observation;
it is, in point of fact, natural to man to personify
<span class="pageno" id="Page_39">39</span>everything that he wishes to comprehend, in order
that later he may control it—the psychical subjugation
as preparation for the physical—but I
provide in addition a motive and genesis for this
peculiarity of human thought.</p>

<p class="c008">‘And now yet a third point. You have dealt
with the origin of religion once before, in your book
<cite>Totem und Tabu</cite>. But there it appears in a
different light. Everything is the son-father relationship;
God is the exalted father, and the
longing for the father is the root of the need for
religion. Since then, it seems, you have discovered
the factor of human weakness and helplessness,
to which indeed the chief part in the formation
of religion is commonly assigned, and you now
transfer to helplessness everything that was
formerly father complex. May I ask you to
enlighten me on this transformation?’</p>

<p class="c008">With pleasure. I was only waiting for this
invitation. But is it really a transformation?
In <cite>Totem und Tabu</cite> it was not my purpose to
explain the origin of religions, but only of totemism.
Can you from any standpoint known to you explain
the fact that the first form in which the protecting
deity revealed itself to men was that of an animal,
that a prohibition existed against killing or eating
this animal, and that yet it was the solemn custom
<span class="pageno" id="Page_40">40</span>to kill it and eat it communally once a year? It
is just this that takes place in totemism. And
it is hardly to the purpose to argue whether
totemism should be called a religion. It has
intimate connections with the later god-religions;
the totem animals become the sacred animals of
the gods; and the earliest, and the most profound,
moral restrictions—the murder prohibition and
the incest prohibition—originate in totemism.
Whether or not you accept the conclusions of
<cite>Totem und Tabu</cite>, I hope you will admit that in
that book a number of very remarkable isolated
facts are brought together into a consistent whole.</p>

<p class="c008">Why in the long run the animal god did not
suffice and why it was replaced by the human—that
was hardly discussed in <cite>Totem und Tabu</cite>,
and other problems of the formation of religion
find no mention there at all. But do you regard
such a limitation as identical with a denial? My
work is a good example of the strict isolation of
the share that psycho-analytic observation can
contribute to the problem of religion. If I am
now trying to add to it the other, less deeply
hidden, part, you should not accuse me of inconsistency,
just as before I was accused of being
one-sided. It is of course my business to point
out the connecting links between what I said
<span class="pageno" id="Page_41">41</span>before and what I now put forward, between the
deeper and the manifest motivation, between the
father complex and man’s helplessness and need
for protection.</p>

<p class="c008">These connections are not difficult to find.
They consist in the relation of the child’s helplessness
to the adult’s continuation of it, so that, as
was to be expected, the psycho-analytic motivation
of the forming of religion turns out to be the
infantile contribution to its manifest motivation.
Let us imagine to ourselves the mental life of
the small child. You remember the object-choice
after the anaclitic type, which psycho-analysis
talks about? The libido follows the paths of
narcissistic needs, and attaches itself to the objects
that ensure their satisfaction. So the mother,
who satisfies hunger, becomes the first love-object,
and certainly also the first protection against all
the undefined and threatening dangers of the outer
world; becomes, if we may so express it, the first
protection against anxiety.</p>

<p class="c008">In this function the mother is soon replaced
by the stronger father, and this situation persists
from now on over the whole of childhood. But
the relation to the father is affected by a peculiar
ambivalence. He was himself a danger, perhaps
just because of that earlier relation to the mother;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_42">42</span>so he is feared no less than he is longed for
and admired. The indications of this ambivalence
are deeply imprinted in all religions, as is
brought out in <cite>Totem und Tabu</cite>. Now when the
child grows up and finds that he is destined to
remain a child for ever, and that he can never do
without protection against unknown and mighty
powers, he invests these with the traits of the
father-figure; he creates for himself the gods,
of whom he is afraid, whom he seeks to propitiate,
and to whom he nevertheless entrusts the task of
protecting him. Thus the longing-for-the-father
explanation is identical with the other, the need
for protection against the consequences of human
weakness; the child’s defensive reaction to his
helplessness gives the characteristic features to
the adult’s reaction to his own sense of helplessness,
<em>i.e</em>. the formation of religion. But it is not
our intention to pursue further the development
of the idea of God; we are concerned here with
the matured stock of religious ideas as culture
transmits them to the individual.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_43">43</span>
  <h2 class="c005">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">Now to take up again the threads of our
enquiry: what is the psychological significance
of religious ideas and how can
we classify them? The question is at first not at all
easy to answer. Having rejected various formulas,
I shall take my stand by this one: religion
consists of certain dogmas, assertions about facts
and conditions of external (or internal) reality,
which tell one something that one has not oneself
discovered and which claim that one should give
them credence. As they give information about
what are to us the most interesting and important
things in life, they are particularly highly valued.
He who knows nothing of them is ignorant indeed,
and he who has assimilated them may consider
himself enriched.</p>

<p class="c008">There are of course many such dogmas about
the most diverse things of this world. Every
school hour is full of them. Let us choose geography.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_44">44</span>We hear there: Konstanz is on the
Bodensee. A student song adds: If you don’t
believe it go and see. I happen to have been
there, and can confirm the fact that this beautiful
town lies on the shore of a broad stretch of water,
which all those dwelling around call the Bodensee.
I am now completely convinced of the accuracy
of this geographical statement. And in this
connection I am reminded of another and very
remarkable experience. I was already a man of
mature years when I stood for the first time on
the hill of the Athenian Acropolis, between the
temple ruins, looking out on to the blue sea. A
feeling of astonishment mingled with my pleasure,
which prompted me to say: then it really is true,
what we used to be taught at school! How
shallow and weak at that age must have been my
belief in the real truth of what I heard if I can be
so astonished to-day! But I will not emphasize
the significance of this experience too much; yet
another explanation of my astonishment is possible,
which did not strike me at the time, and which is
of a wholly subjective nature and connected with
the peculiar character of the place.</p>

<p class="c008">All such dogmas as these, then, exact belief
in their contents, but not without substantiating
their title to this. They claim to be the condensed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_45">45</span>result of a long process of thought, which is
founded on observation and also, certainly, on
reasoning; they show how, if one so intends, one
can go through this process oneself, instead of
accepting the result of it; and the source of the
knowledge imparted by the dogma is always
added, where it is not, as with geographical statements,
self-evident. For instance: the earth is
shaped like a globe; the proofs adduced for this
are Foucault’s pendulum experiment, the phenomena
of the horizon and the possibility of circumnavigating
the earth. Since it is impracticable,
as all concerned realize, to send every school child
on a voyage round the world, one is content that
the school teaching shall be taken on trust, but
one knows that the way to personal conviction is
still open.</p>

<p class="c008">Let us try to apply the same tests to the dogmas
of religion. If we ask on what their claim to be
believed is based, we receive three answers, which
accord remarkably ill with one another. They
deserve to be believed: firstly, because our primal
ancestors already believed them; secondly, because
we possess proofs, which have been handed down
to us from this very period of antiquity; and
thirdly, because it is forbidden to raise the question
of their authenticity at all. Formerly this presumptuous
<span class="pageno" id="Page_46">46</span>act was visited with the very severest
penalties, and even to-day society is unwilling
to see anyone renew it.</p>

<p class="c008">This third point cannot but rouse our strongest
suspicions. Such a prohibition can surely have
only one motive: that society knows very well
the uncertain basis of the claim it makes for its
religious doctrines. If it were otherwise, the
relevant material would certainly be placed most
readily at the disposal of anyone who wished to
gain conviction for himself. And so we proceed
to test the other two arguments with a feeling of
mistrust not easily allayed. We ought to believe
because our forefathers believed. But these
ancestors of ours were far more ignorant than we;
they believed in things we could not possibly
accept to-day; so the possibility occurs that
religious doctrines may also be in this category.
The proofs they have bequeathed to us are deposited
in writings that themselves bear every
trace of being untrustworthy. They are full of
contradictions, revisions, and interpolations; where
they speak of actual authentic proofs they are
themselves of doubtful authenticity. It does
not help much if divine revelation is asserted
to be the origin of their text or only of their
content, for this assertion is itself already a part
<span class="pageno" id="Page_47">47</span>of those doctrines whose authenticity is to be
examined, and no statement can bear its own
proof.</p>

<p class="c008">Thus we arrive at the singular conclusion that
just what might be of the greatest significance for
us in our cultural system, the information which
should solve for us the riddles of the universe and
reconcile us to the troubles of life, that just this
has the weakest possible claim to authenticity.
We should not be able to bring ourselves to accept
anything of as little concern to us as the fact that
whales bear young instead of laying eggs, if it were
not capable of better proof than this.</p>

<p class="c008">This state of things is in itself a very remarkable
psychological problem. Let no one think that
the foregoing remarks on the impossibility of
proving religious doctrines contain anything new.
It has been felt at all times, assuredly even by the
ancestors who bequeathed this legacy. Probably
many of them nursed the same doubts as we, but
the pressure imposed on them was too strong for
them to have dared to utter them. And since
then countless people have been tortured by the
same doubts, which they would fain have suppressed
because they held themselves in duty
bound to believe, and since then many brilliant
intellects have been wrecked upon this conflict
<span class="pageno" id="Page_48">48</span>and many characters have come to grief through
the compromises by which they sought a way
out.</p>

<p class="c008">If all the arguments that are put forward for
the authenticity of religious doctrines originate in
the past, it is natural to look round and see whether
the present, better able to judge in these matters,
cannot also furnish such evidence. The whole of
the religious system would become infinitely more
credible if one could succeed in this way in removing
the element of doubt from a single part of it. It
is at this point that the activity of the spiritualists
comes in; they are convinced of the immortality
of the individual soul, and they would demonstrate
to us that this one article of religious teaching is
free from doubt. Unfortunately they have not
succeeded in disproving the fact that the appearances
and utterances of their spirits are merely
the productions of their own mental activity.
They have called up the spirits of the greatest of
men, of the most eminent thinkers, but all their
utterances and all the information they have
received from them have been so foolish and so
desperately insignificant that one could find nothing
else to believe in but the capacity of the spirits
for adapting themselves to the circle of people
that had evoked them.</p>

<p class="c008"><span class="pageno" id="Page_49">49</span>One must now mention two attempts to evade
the problem, which both convey the impression of
frantic effort. One of them, high-handed in its
nature, is old; the other is subtle and modern.
The first is the <em>Credo quia absurdum</em> of the early
Father. It would imply that religious doctrines
are outside reason’s jurisdiction; they stand above
reason. Their truth must be inwardly felt: one
does not need to comprehend them. But this
<em>Credo</em> is only of interest as a voluntary confession;
as a decree it has no binding force. Am I to be
obliged to believe every absurdity? And if not,
why just this one? There is no appeal beyond
reason. And if the truth of religious doctrines
is dependent on an inner experience which bears
witness to that truth, what is one to make of the
many people who do not have that rare experience?
One may expect all men to use the gift of reason
that they possess, but one cannot set up an
obligation that shall apply to all on a basis that
only exists for quite a few. Of what significance
is it for other people that you have won from a
state of ecstasy, which has deeply moved you, an
imperturbable conviction of the real truth of the
doctrines of religion?</p>

<p class="c008">The second attempt is that of the philosophy
of ‘As If’. It explains that in our mental activity
<span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>we assume all manner of things, the groundlessness,
indeed the absurdity, of which we fully
realize. They are called ‘fictions’, but from a
variety of practical motives we are led to behave
‘as if’ we believed in these fictions. This, it is
argued, is the case with religious doctrines on
account of their unequalled importance for the
maintenance of human society.<a id="r2"></a><a class="c007 pginternal" href="#f2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This argument is
not far removed from the <em>Credo quia absurdum</em>.
But I think that the claim of the philosophy of
‘As If’ is such as only a philosopher could make.
The man whose thinking is not influenced by the
wiles of philosophy will never be able to accept
it; with the confession of absurdity, of illogicality,
there is no more to be said as far as he is concerned.
He cannot be expected to forgo the
guarantees he demands for all his usual activities
just in the matter of his most important interests.
I am reminded of one of my children who was
distinguished at an early age by a peculiarly
<span class="pageno" id="Page_51">51</span>marked sense of reality. When the children were
told a fairy tale, to which they listened with rapt
attention, he would come forward and ask: Is
that a true story? Having been told that it was
not, he would turn away with an air of disdain.
It is to be expected that men will soon behave
in like manner towards the religious fairy tales,
despite the advocacy of the philosophy of ‘As If’.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="f2">
<p class="c008"><a href="#r2" class="pginternal">2</a>. I hope I am not doing an injustice if I make the author of
the philosophy of ‘As If’ represent a point of view that is familiar
to other thinkers also. Cp. H. Vaihinger, <cite>Die Philosophie des Als
ob</cite>, Siebente und achte Auflage, 1922, S. 68: ‘We include as
fictions not merely indifferent theoretical operations but ideational
constructions emanating from the noblest minds, to which the
noblest part of mankind cling and of which they will not allow
themselves to be deprived. Nor is it our object so to deprive
them—for as <em>practical fictions</em> we leave them all intact; they
perish only as <em>theoretical truths</em>’ (C. K. Ogden’s translation).</p>
</div>

<p class="c008">But at present they still behave quite differently,
and in past ages, in spite of their incontrovertible
lack of authenticity, religious ideas have exercised
the very strongest influence on mankind. This
is a fresh psychological problem. We must ask
where the inherent strength of these doctrines lies
and to what circumstance they owe their efficacy,
independent, as it is, of the acknowledgement of
the reason.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>
  <h2 class="c005">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">I think we have sufficiently paved the way for
the answer to both these questions. It will
be found if we fix our attention on the psychical
origin of religious ideas. These, which profess to
be dogmas, are not the residue of experience or
the final result of reflection; they are illusions,
fulfilments of the oldest, strongest and most
insistent wishes of mankind; the secret of their
strength is the strength of these wishes. We know
already that the terrifying effect of infantile helplessness
aroused the need for protection—protection
through love—which the father relieved, and that
the discovery that this helplessness would continue
through the whole of life made it necessary to
cling to the existence of a father—but this time a
more powerful one. Thus the benevolent rule of
divine providence allays our anxiety in face of
life’s dangers, the establishment of a moral world
order ensures the fulfilment of the demands of
justice, which within human culture have so often
<span class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>remained unfulfilled, and the prolongation of
earthly existence by a future life provides in
addition the local and temporal setting for these
wish-fulfilments. Answers to the questions that
tempt human curiosity, such as the origin of the
universe and the relation between the body and
the soul, are developed in accordance with the
underlying assumptions of this system; it betokens
a tremendous relief for the individual psyche if it
is released from the conflicts of childhood arising
out of the father complex, which are never wholly
overcome, and if these conflicts are afforded a
universally accepted solution.</p>

<p class="c008">When I say that they are illusions, I must
define the meaning of the word. An illusion is
not the same as an error, it is indeed not necessarily
an error. Aristotle’s belief that vermin are
evolved out of dung, to which ignorant people
still cling, was an error; so was the belief of a
former generation of doctors that <em>tabes dorsalis</em> was
the result of sexual excess. It would be improper
to call these errors illusions. On the other hand,
it was an illusion on the part of Columbus that
he had discovered a new sea-route to India. The
part played by his wish in this error is very clear.
One may describe as an illusion the statement of
certain nationalists that the Indo-Germanic race
<span class="pageno" id="Page_54">54</span>is the only one capable of culture, or the belief,
which only psycho-analysis destroyed, that the
child is a being without sexuality. It is characteristic
of the illusion that it is derived from
men’s wishes; in this respect it approaches the
psychiatric delusion, but it is to be distinguished
from this, quite apart from the more complicated
structure of the latter. In the delusion we emphasize
as essential the conflict with reality; the
illusion need not be necessarily false, that is to
say, unrealizable or incompatible with reality.
For instance, a poor girl may have an illusion
that a prince will come and fetch her home. It
is possible; some such cases have occurred. That
the Messiah will come and found a golden age is
much less probable; according to one’s personal
attitude one will classify this belief as an illusion
or as analogous to a delusion. Examples of illusions
that have come true are not easy to discover,
but the illusion of the alchemists that all metals
can be turned into gold may prove to be one.
The desire to have lots of gold, as much gold as
possible, has been considerably damped by our
modern insight into the nature of wealth, yet
chemistry no longer considers a transmutation of
metals into gold as impossible. Thus we call a
belief an illusion when wish-fulfilment is a prominent
<span class="pageno" id="Page_55">55</span>factor in its motivation, while disregarding
its relations to reality, just as the illusion itself
does.</p>

<p class="c008">If after this survey we turn again to religious
doctrines, we may reiterate that they are all
illusions, they do not admit of proof, and no one
can be compelled to consider them as true or to
believe in them. Some of them are so improbable,
so very incompatible with everything we
have laboriously discovered about the reality of
the world, that we may compare them—taking
adequately into account the psychological differences—to
delusions. Of the reality value of
most of them we cannot judge; just as they
cannot be proved, neither can they be refuted.
We still know too little to approach them critically.
The riddles of the universe only reveal themselves
slowly to our enquiry, to many questions science
can as yet give no answer; but scientific work is
our only way to the knowledge of external reality.
Again, it is merely illusion to expect anything
from intuition or trance; they can give us nothing
but particulars, which are difficult to interpret,
about our own mental life, never information
about the questions that are so lightly answered
by the doctrines of religion. It would be wanton
to let one’s own arbitrary action fill the gap, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_56">56</span>according to one’s personal estimate declare this
or that part of the religious system to be more
or less acceptable. These questions are too
momentous for that; too sacred, one might say.</p>

<p class="c008">At this point it may be objected: well, then,
if even the crabbed sceptics admit that the statements
of religion cannot be confuted by reason,
why should not I believe in them, since they have
so much on their side—tradition, the concurrence
of mankind, and all the consolation they yield?
Yes, why not? Just as no one can be forced into
belief, so no one can be forced into unbelief. But
do not deceive yourself into thinking that with
such arguments you are following the path of
correct reasoning. If ever there was a case of
facile argument, this is one. Ignorance is ignorance;
no right to believe anything is derived from
it. No reasonable man will behave so frivolously
in other matters or rest content with such feeble
grounds for his opinions or for the attitude he
adopts; it is only in the highest and holiest
things that he allows this. In reality these are
only attempts to delude oneself or other people
into the belief that one still holds fast to religion,
when one has long cut oneself loose from it.
Where questions of religion are concerned people
are guilty of every possible kind of insincerity and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_57">57</span>intellectual misdemeanour. Philosophers stretch
the meaning of words until they retain scarcely
anything of their original sense; by calling ‘God’
some vague abstraction which they have created
for themselves, they pose as deists, as believers,
before the world; they may even pride themselves
on having attained a higher and purer idea
of God, although their God is nothing but an
insubstantial shadow and no longer the mighty
personality of religious doctrine. Critics persist in
calling ‘deeply religious’ a person who confesses
to a sense of man’s insignificance and impotence
in face of the universe, although it is not this
feeling that constitutes the essence of religious
emotion, but rather the next step, the reaction to
it, which seeks a remedy against this feeling. He
who goes no further, he who humbly acquiesces in
the insignificant part man plays in the universe,
is, on the contrary, irreligious in the truest sense
of the word.</p>

<p class="c008">It does not lie within the scope of this enquiry
to estimate the value of religious doctrines as
truth. It suffices that we have recognized them,
psychologically considered, as illusions. But we
need not conceal the fact that this discovery
strongly influences our attitude to what must
appear to many the most important of questions.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>We know approximately at what periods and by
what sort of men religious doctrines were formed.
If we now learn from what motives this happened,
our attitude to the problem of religion will suffer
an appreciable change. We say to ourselves: it
would indeed be very nice if there were a God,
who was both creator of the world and a benevolent
providence, if there were a moral world order
and a future life, but at the same time it is very
odd that this is all just as we should wish it
ourselves. And it would be still odder if our
poor, ignorant, enslaved ancestors had succeeded
in solving all these difficult riddles of the universe.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_59">59</span>
  <h2 class="c005">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">Having recognized religious doctrines to
be illusions, we are at once confronted
with the further question: may not other
cultural possessions, which we esteem highly and
by which we let our life be ruled, be of a similar
nature? Should not the assumptions that regulate
our political institutions likewise be called illusions,
and is it not the case that in our culture the
relations between the sexes are disturbed by an
erotic illusion, or by a series of erotic illusions?
Once our suspicions have been roused, we shall not
shrink from asking whether there is any better
foundation for our conviction that it is possible to
discover something about external reality through
the applying of observation and reasoning in scientific
work. Nothing need keep us from applying
observation to our own natures or submitting the
process of reasoning to its own criticism. Here a
series of enquiries present themselves, which in their
result should be of decisive importance for constructing
<span class="pageno" id="Page_60">60</span>a ‘Weltanschauung’. We surmise, too, that
such an endeavour would not be wasted, and that
it would at least partially justify our suspicions.
But the author of these pages has not the means
to undertake so comprehensive a task; forced by
necessity, he confines his work to the pursuit of
a single one of these illusions, that is, the religious.</p>

<p class="c008">But now the loud voice of our opponent bids
us to stop. We are called to account for our
transgressions.</p>

<p class="c008">‘Archæological interests are no doubt most
praiseworthy, but one does not set about an
excavation if one is thereby going to undermine
occupied dwelling-places so that they collapse and
bury the inhabitants under their ruins. The
doctrines of religion are not a subject that one
can be clever about, as one can about any other.
Our culture is built up on them; the preservation
of human society rests on the assumption that
the majority of mankind believe in the truth of
these doctrines. If they are taught that there
is no almighty and all just God, no divine world
order, and no future life, then they will feel exempt
from all obligation to follow the rules of culture.
Uninhibited and free from fear, everybody will
follow his asocial, egoistic instincts, and will seek
to prove his power. Chaos, which we have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_61">61</span>banished through thousands of years of the work
of civilization, will begin again. Even if one
knew, and could prove, that religion was not in
possession of the truth, one should conceal the
fact and behave as the philosophy of “As If”
demands—and this in the interests of the preservation
of everybody. And apart from the danger
of the undertaking, it is also a purposeless cruelty.
Countless people find their one consolation in the
doctrines of religion, and only with their help can
they endure life. You would rob them of what
supports them, and yet you have nothing better
to give them in exchange. It has been admitted
that so far science has not achieved much, but
even if it had advanced far further, it would not
suffice for men. Man has yet other imperative
needs, which can never be satisfied by cold science,
and it is very strange—to be frank, it is the acme
of inconsistency—that a psychologist who has
always emphasized how much in men’s lives the
intelligence retreats before the life of the instincts
should now strive to rob men of a precious wish-satisfaction,
and should want to give them in
exchange a compensation of an intellectual nature.’</p>

<p class="c008">What a number of accusations all at once!
However, I am prepared to deny them all; and
what is more, I am prepared to defend the statement
<span class="pageno" id="Page_62">62</span>that culture incurs a greater danger by
maintaining its present attitude to religion than
by relinquishing it. But I hardly know where
to begin my reply.</p>

<p class="c008">Perhaps with the assurance that I myself
consider my undertaking to be completely harmless
and free from danger. This time the overestimation
of the intellect is not on my side. If
men are such as my opponents describe them—and
I have no wish to contradict it—then there
is no danger of a devout believer, overwhelmed
by my arguments, being deprived of his faith.
Besides, I have said nothing that other and better
men have not said before me in a much more
complete, forcible and impressive way. The
names of these men are well known. I shall not
quote them. I should not like to give the impression
that I would count myself of their number.
I have merely—this is the only thing that is new
in my statement—added a certain psychological
foundation to the critique of my great predecessors.
It is hardly to be expected that just this addition
will produce the effect that was denied to the earlier
attempts. Certainly I might be asked at this
point why I write such things if I am convinced
of their ineffectiveness. But we shall come back
to that later.</p>

<p class="c008"><span class="pageno" id="Page_63">63</span>The one person this publication may harm is
myself. I shall have to listen to the most unpleasant
reproaches on the score of shallowness,
narrow-mindedness, and lack of idealism and of
understanding for the highest interests of mankind.
But on the one hand these remonstrances are
not new to me; and on the other hand, if a man
has even in his early years learnt to face the displeasure
of his contemporaries, what effect then
can it have on him in his old age, when he is certain
to be soon beyond the reach of all favour or disfavour?
In former times it was different. Then
utterances such as these brought with them a
sure foreshortening of one’s earthly existence and
a speedy approach of the opportunity to gain
personal experience of the next life. But, I
repeat, those times are over, and to-day such things
can be written without endangering even the
author; the most that can happen will be that
in this or that country the translation and the
circulation of his book will be forbidden—and
naturally this will happen just in that country
which feels certain of the high standard of its
culture. But one must be able to put up with this
also, if one makes any plea for wish-renunciation
or for acquiescence in fate.</p>

<p class="c008">And then it occurred to me to ask whether the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_64">64</span>publication of this work might not do some harm
after all—not indeed to a person, but to a cause:
the cause of psycho-analysis. For it cannot be
denied that this is my creation, and that an
abundance of distrust and ill-will has been shown
to it. If I now come forward with such displeasing
statements, people will be only too ready to displace
their feelings from my person on to psycho-analysis.
Now one can see, it will be said, where
psycho-analysis leads to. The mask is fallen;
it leads to the denial of God and of an ethical
ideal, as indeed we have always supposed. To
keep us from the discovery, we have been made to
believe that psycho-analysis neither has, nor can
have, a philosophical standpoint.</p>

<p class="c008">This pother will be really disagreeable to me
on account of my many fellow-workers, several
of whom do not at all share my attitude to religious
problems. However, psycho-analysis has already
braved many storms, and it must face this new
one also. In reality psycho-analysis is a method
of investigation, an impartial instrument like,
say, the infinitesimal calculus. Even if a physicist
should discover with the help of the latter that
after a certain period the earth will be destroyed,
one would still hesitate to impute destructive
tendencies to the calculus itself, and to proscribe
<span class="pageno" id="Page_65">65</span>it on that account. Nothing that I have said
here against the truth-value of religion needed
the support of psycho-analysis; it had been said
by others long before psycho-analysis came into
existence. If one can find a new argument against
the truth of religion by applying the psycho-analytic
method, so much the worse for religion,
but the defenders of religion will with equal right
avail themselves of psycho-analysis in order to
appreciate to the full the affective significance of
religious doctrines.</p>

<p class="c008">And now to proceed with the defence: clearly
religion has performed great services for human
culture. It has contributed much toward restraining
the asocial instincts, but still not enough.
For many thousands of years it has ruled human
society; it has had time to show what it can
achieve. If it had succeeded in making happy
the greater part of mankind, in consoling them,
in reconciling them to life, and in making them
into supporters of civilization, then no one would
dream of striving to alter existing conditions.
But instead of this what do we see? We see
that an appallingly large number of men are discontented
with civilization and unhappy in it, and
feel it as a yoke that must be shaken off; that these
men either do everything in their power to alter
<span class="pageno" id="Page_66">66</span>this civilization, or else go so far in their hostility
to it that they will have nothing whatever to do
either with civilization or with restraining their
instincts. At this point it will be objected that
this state of affairs is due to the very fact that
religion has forfeited a part of its influence on
the masses, just because of the deplorable effect
of the advances in science. We shall note this
admission and the reasons given for it, and shall
make use of it later for our own purposes; but
the objection itself has no force.</p>

<p class="c008">It is doubtful whether men were in general
happier at a time when religious doctrines held
unlimited sway than they are now; more moral
they certainly were not. They have always
understood how to externalize religious precepts,
thereby frustrating their intentions. And the
priests, who had to enforce religious obedience,
met them half-way. God’s kindness must lay a
restraining hand upon his justice. One sinned,
and then one made oblation or did penance, and
then one was free to sin anew. Russian mysticism
has come to the sublime conclusion that sin is
indispensable for the full enjoyment of the blessings
of divine grace, and therefore, fundamentally, it
is pleasing to God. It is well known that the
priests could only keep the masses submissive to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_67">67</span>religion by making these great concessions to
human instincts. And so it was settled: God
alone is strong and good, man is weak and sinful.
Immorality, no less than morality, has at all times
found support in religion. If the achievements
of religion in promoting men’s happiness, in
adapting them to civilization, and in controlling
them morally, are no better, then the question
arises whether we are right in considering it
necessary for mankind, and whether we do
wisely in basing the demands of our culture
upon it.</p>

<p class="c008">Let us consider the unmistakable character of
the present situation. We have heard the admission
that religion no longer has the same influence
on men that it used to have (we are concerned
here with European Christian culture). And this,
not because its promises have become smaller,
but because they appear less credible to people.
Let us admit that the reason—perhaps not the
only one—for this change is the increase of the
scientific spirit in the higher strata of human
society. Criticism has nibbled at the authenticity
of religious documents, natural science has shown
up the errors contained in them, and the comparative
method of research has revealed the fatal
resemblance between religious ideas revered by
<span class="pageno" id="Page_68">68</span>us and the mental productions of primitive ages
and peoples.</p>

<p class="c008">The scientific spirit engenders a particular
attitude to the problems of this world; before
the problems of religion it halts for a while, then
wavers, and finally here too steps over the threshold.
In this process there is no stopping. The
more the fruits of knowledge become accessible
to men, the more widespread is the decline of
religious belief, at first only of the obsolete and
objectionable expressions of the same, then of its
fundamental assumptions, also. The Americans
who instituted the monkey trial in Dayton have
alone proved consistent. Elsewhere the inevitable
transition is accomplished by way of half-measures
and insincerities.</p>

<p class="c008">Culture has little to fear from the educated or
from the brain workers. In their case religious
motives for civilized behaviour would be unobtrusively
replaced by other and secular ones;
besides, for the most part they are themselves
supporters of culture. But it is another matter
with the great mass of the uneducated and suppressed,
who have every reason to be enemies of
culture. So long as they do not discover that
people no longer believe in God, all is well. But
they discover it, infallibly, and would do so even
<span class="pageno" id="Page_69">69</span>if this work of mine were not published. They
are ready to accept the results of scientific thought,
without having effected in themselves the process
of change which scientific thought induces in men.
Is there not a danger that these masses, in their
hostility to culture, will attack the weak point
which they have discovered in their taskmaster?
If you must not kill your neighbour, solely because
God has forbidden it and will sorely avenge it in
this or the other life, and you then discover that
there is no God so that one need not fear his
punishment, then you will certainly kill without
hesitation, and you could only be prevented from
this by mundane force. And so follows the
necessity for either the most rigorous suppression
of these dangerous masses and the most careful
exclusion of all opportunities for mental awakening
or a fundamental revision of the relation between
culture and religion.</p>

  <h2 class="c005">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">One would suppose that this last proposal
could be carried out without any
special difficulty. It is true that it
would involve some measure of renunciation, but
one would gain, perhaps, more than one lost, and
a great danger would be avoided. But people
have a horror of it, as if civilization would thereby
be exposed to an even greater danger. When
Saint Boniface felled the tree which was venerated
as sacred by the Saxons, those who stood round
expected some fearful event to follow the outrage.
It did not happen, and the Saxons were baptized.</p>

<p class="c008">It is manifestly in the interest of man’s communal
existence, which would not otherwise be
practicable, that civilization has laid down the
commandment that one shall not kill the neighbour
whom one hates, who is in one’s way, or
whose property one covets. For the murderer
would draw on to himself the vengeance of the
murdered man’s kinsmen and the secret envy of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_71">71</span>the others who feel as much inward inclination as
he did to such an act of violence. Thus he would
not enjoy his revenge or his spoil for long, but
would have every prospect of being killed soon
himself. Even if he could defend himself against
single foes by his extraordinary strength and
caution, he would be bound to succumb to a
combination of these weaker foes. If a combination
of this sort did not take place, then
murder would continue ceaselessly, and the end
of it would be that men would exterminate one
another. It would be the same state of affairs
among individuals that still prevails in Corsica
among families, but otherwise survives only among
nations. Insecurity of life, an equal danger for
all, now unites men into one society, which forbids
the individual to kill and reserves to itself the
right to kill in the name of society the man who
violates this prohibition. This, then, is justice and
punishment.</p>

<p class="c008">We do not, however, tell others of this rational
basis for the murder prohibition; we declare, on
the contrary, that God is its author. Thus,
making bold to divine his intentions, we find that
he has no wish, either, for men to exterminate
each other. By acting thus we invest the cultural
prohibition with a quite peculiar solemnity, but at
<span class="pageno" id="Page_72">72</span>the same time we risk making its observance
dependent on belief in God. If we retract this
step, no longer saddling God with our own wishes,
and content ourselves with the social justification
for the cultural prohibition, then we renounce, it
is true, its hallowed nature, but we also avoid
endangering its existence. And we gain something
else as well. Through some kind of diffusion or
infection the character of sanctity and inviolability,
of other-worldliness, one might say, has been
extended from some few important prohibitions
to all other cultural institutions and laws and
ordinances. And often the halo becomes these
none too well; not only do they invalidate each
other by making conflicting decisions according to
the time and place of their origin; even apart
from this they betray every sign of human inadequacy.
One can easily recognize among them
things which can only be the product of shortsightedness
and apprehensiveness, the expression
of narrow interests, or the result of inadequate
hypotheses. The criticism to which one must
subject them also diminishes to an unwelcome
extent people’s respect for other and more
justified cultural demands. As it is a delicate task
to decide what God has himself ordained and what
derives rather from the authority of an allpowerful
<span class="pageno" id="Page_73">73</span>parliament or a supreme judicial decision,
it would be an indubitable advantage to leave
God out of the question altogether, and to admit
honestly the purely human origin of all cultural
laws and institutions. Along with their pretensions
to sanctity the rigid and immutable nature
of these laws and regulations would also cease.
Men would realize that these have been made,
not so much to rule them, as, on the contrary, to
serve their interests; they would acquire a more
friendly attitude to them, and instead of aiming
at their abolition they would aim only at improving
them. This would be an important advance
on the road which leads to reconciliation with the
burden of culture.</p>

<p class="c008">But here our plea for a purely rational basis
for cultural laws, that is to say, for deriving them
from social necessity, is interrupted by a sudden
doubt. We have chosen as our example the origin
of the murder prohibition. But does our account
of it correspond to historical truth? We fear not;
it appears to be merely a rationalistic construction.
With the help of psycho-analysis we have studied
this very point in the history of human culture,
and supported by this study we are bound to say
that in reality it did not happen like this. Even
in men to-day purely reasonable motives are of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_74">74</span>little avail against passionate impulses. How
much weaker, then, must they have been in the
primordial animal man! Perhaps even now his
descendants would still kill one another without
inhibition, if there had not been among those acts
of murder one—the slaughter of the primal father—which
evoked an irresistible emotional reaction,
momentous in its consequences. From it arose
the commandment: thou shalt not kill, which in
totemism was confined to the father-substitute,
and was later extended to others, but which even
to-day is not universally observed.</p>

<p class="c008">But according to arguments which I need not
repeat here, that primal father has been the prototype
of God, the model after which later generations
have formed their figure of God. Hence the
religious explanation is right. God was actually
concerned in the origin of that prohibition; his
influence, not insight into what was necessary for
society, brought it into being. And the process
of attributing man’s will to God is fully justified;
for men, knowing that they had brutally set aside
the father, determined, in the reaction to their
outrage, to respect his will in future. And so the
religious doctrine does give us the historical truth,
though of course in a somewhat remodelled and
disguised form; our rational explanation belies it.</p>

<p class="c008"><span class="pageno" id="Page_75">75</span>We now observe that the stock of religious
ideas contains not only wish-fulfilments, but also
important historical memories. What matchless,
what abundant power this combination of past
and present must give to religion! But with the
help of an analogy we may perhaps feel our way
towards another view of the problem. It is not a
good thing to transplant ideas far away from the
soil in which they grew, but we cannot resist
pointing out the resemblance which forms this
analogy. We know that the human child cannot
well complete its development towards culture
without passing through a more or less distinct
phase of neurosis. This is because the child is
unable to suppress by rational mental effort so
many of those instinctual impulsions which cannot
later be turned to account, but has to check
them by acts of repression, behind which there
stands as a rule an anxiety motive. Most of these
child neuroses are overcome spontaneously as one
grows up, and especially is this the fate of the
obsessional neuroses of childhood. The remainder
can be cleared up still later by psycho-analytic
treatment. In just the same way one might
assume that in its development through the ages
mankind as a whole experiences conditions that
are analogous to the neuroses, and this for the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_76">76</span>same reasons, because in the ages of its ignorance
and intellectual weakness it achieved by purely
affective means the instinctual renunciations, indispensable
for man’s communal existence. And
the residue of these repression-like processes,
which took place in antiquity, has long clung on
to civilization. Thus religion would be the universal
obsessional neurosis of humanity. It, like
the child’s, originated in the Oedipus complex, the
relation to the father. According to this conception
one might prophesy that the abandoning
of religion must take place with the fateful
inexorability of a process of growth, and that we
are just now in the middle of this phase of
development.</p>

<p class="c008">So we should form our behaviour after the
model of a sensible teacher, who does not oppose
the new development confronting him, but seeks
to further it and to temper the force of its onset.
To be sure this analogy does not exhaust the
essence of religion. If on the one hand religion
brings with it obsessional limitation, which can
only be compared to an individual obsessional
neurosis, it comprises on the other hand a system
of wish-illusions, incompatible with reality, such
as we find in an isolated form only in Meynert’s
amentia, a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_77">77</span>But these are only just comparisons, with whose
help we can endeavour to understand social phenomena;
individual psychology supplies us with no
exact counterpart.</p>

<p class="c008">It has been shown repeatedly (by myself, and
particularly by Theodor Reik) into what details
the analogy of religion and the obsessional neurosis
may be pursued, how much of the vicissitudes and
peculiarities of the formation of religion may be
understood in this way. And it accords well with
this that the true believer is in a high degree
protected against the danger of certain neurotic
afflictions; by accepting the universal neurosis he
is spared the task of forming a personal neurosis.</p>

<p class="c008">Our knowledge of the historical value of certain
religious doctrines increases our respect for them,
but it does not invalidate our proposal to exclude
them from the motivation of cultural laws. On
the contrary! This historical residue has given
us the conception of religious dogmas as, so to
speak, neurotic survivals, and now we may say
that the time has probably come to replace the
consequences of repression by the results of
rational mental effort, as in the analytic treatment
of neurotics. One may prophesy, but hardly regret,
that this process of remodelling will not stop at
dispelling the solemn air of sanctity surrounding
<span class="pageno" id="Page_78">78</span>the cultural laws, but that a general revision of
these must involve the abolition of many of them.
And this will go far to solve our appointed problem
of reconciling men to civilization. We need not
regret the loss of historical truth involved in
accepting the rational motivation of cultural laws.
The truths contained in religious doctrines are
after all so distorted and systematically disguised
that the mass of mankind cannot recognize them
as truth. It is an instance of the same thing when
we tell the child that new-born babies are brought
by the stork. Here, too, we tell the truth in
symbolic guise, for we know what that large bird
signifies. But the child does not know it; he hears
only the distortion, and feels that he has been
deceived; and we know how often his refractoriness
and his distrust of the grown-ups gets bound
up with this impression. We have come to the
conclusion that it is better to avoid such symbolic
disguisings of the truth, and to allow the child
knowledge of the real state of affairs in a way
suitable for his stage of intellectual development.</p>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">‘You allow yourself contradictions which
are hard to reconcile with one another.
First you declare that a work like yours
is quite harmless; no one will let himself be robbed
of his religious faith through such discussions.
But since, as became evident later, it is your aim
to disturb this faith, one may ask: why in fact
do you publish it? At another point, however,
you admit that it might be dangerous, indeed very
dangerous, for a man to discover that people no
longer believe in God. Docile though he had been
hitherto, now he would throw off all allegiance
to the laws of culture. Your whole argument
that the religious motivation of the cultural
commandments signifies a danger for culture rests,
in fact, on the assumption that the believer can
be made into an unbeliever. But that is a complete
contradiction.</p>

<p class="c008">‘And here is another contradiction: you admit
on the one hand that man will not be guided by
<span class="pageno" id="Page_80">80</span>intelligence; he is ruled by his passions and by the
claims of his instincts; but on the other hand
you propose to replace the affective basis of his
allegiance to culture by a rational one. Let
who can understand this. To me it seems a case
of either the one or the other.</p>

<p class="c008">‘Besides, have you learnt nothing from history?
Once before such an attempt to substitute reason
for religion was made, officially and in the grand
manner. Surely you remember the French Revolution
and Robespierre, and also how short-lived
and how deplorably ineffectual the experiment?
It is being repeated in Russia at present, and we
need not be curious about the result. Do you
not think we may assume that man cannot do
without religion?</p>

<p class="c008">‘You have said yourself that religion is more
than an obsessional neurosis. But you have not
dealt with this other aspect of it. You are content
to work out the analogy with the neurosis. Men
must be freed from a neurosis. What else is lost
in the process does not trouble you.’</p>

<p class="c008">Probably these apparent contradictions have
arisen because I have been dealing too hastily with
complicated matters, but we can make up for this
to some extent. I still maintain that in one
respect my work is quite harmless. No believer
<span class="pageno" id="Page_81">81</span>will let himself be led astray by these or by similar
arguments. A believer has certain ties of affection
binding him to the substance of religion. There
are certainly a vast number of other people who
are not religious in the same sense. They obey
the laws of civilization because they are intimidated
by the threats of religion, and they fear religion so
long as they consider it as a part of the reality
that restricts them. These are the people who
break free as soon as they dare to give up their
belief in its reality value; but arguments have
no effect on them either. They cease to fear
religion when they find that others do not fear it,
and of these I have asserted that they would learn
of the decline of religious influence even if I did
not publish my work.</p>

<p class="c008">But I suppose you yourself attach more value
to the other contradiction with which you tax me.
Since men are so slightly amenable to reasonable
arguments, so completely are they ruled by their
instinctual wishes, why should one want to take
away from them a means of satisfying their
instincts and replace it by reasonable arguments?
Certainly men are like this, but have you asked
yourself whether they need be so, whether their
inmost nature necessitates it? Can an anthropologist
give the cranial index of a people whose
<span class="pageno" id="Page_82">82</span>custom it is to deform their children’s heads by
bandaging them from their earliest years? Think
of the distressing contrast between the radiant
intelligence of a healthy child and the feeble
mentality of the average adult. Is it so utterly
impossible that it is just religious up-bringing
which is largely to blame for this relative degeneration?
I think it would be a very long time
before a child who was not influenced began
to trouble himself about God and the things
beyond this world. Perhaps his thoughts on
these matters would then take the same course
as they did with his ancestors; but we do
not wait for this development; we introduce
him to the doctrines of religion at a time when
he is neither interested in them nor capable of
grasping their import. Is it not true that the
two main points in the modern educational programme
are the retardation of sexual development
and the early application of religious influence? So
when the child’s mind awakens, the doctrines of
religion are already unassailable. But do you
suppose that it is particularly conducive to the
strengthening of the mental function that so
important a sphere should be closed to it by the
menace of hell pains? We need not be greatly
surprised at the feeble mentality of the man who
<span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>has once brought himself to accept without
criticism all the absurdities that religious doctrines
repeat to him, and even to overlook the contradictions
between them. Now we have no other
means of controlling our instincts than our intelligence.
And how can we expect people who
are dominated by thought-prohibitions to attain
the psychological ideal, the primacy of the intelligence?
You know too that women in general
are said to suffer from so-called ‘physiological
weak-mindedness’, <em>i.e.</em> a poorer intelligence than
the man’s. The fact itself is disputable, its
interpretation doubtful; but it has been argued
for the secondary nature of this intellectual
degeneration that women labour under the harshness
of the early prohibition, which prevented
them from applying their mind to what would
have interested them most, that is to say, to the
problems of sexual life. So long as a man’s early
years are influenced by the religious thought-inhibition
and by the loyal one derived from it,
as well as by the sexual one, we cannot really say
what he is actually like.</p>

<p class="c008">But I will curb my ardour and admit the possibility
that I too am chasing after an illusion.
Perhaps the effect of the religious thought-prohibition
is not as bad as I assume, perhaps it will
<span class="pageno" id="Page_84">84</span>turn out that human nature remains the same
even if education is not abused by being subjected
to religion. I do not know, and you cannot know
either. It is not only the great problems of this
life that seem at present insoluble; there are many
smaller questions also that are hard to decide.
But you must admit that there is here the justification
for a hope for the future, that perhaps we
may dig up a treasure which can enrich culture,
and that it is worth while to make the experiment
of a non-religious education. Should it
prove unsatisfactory, I am ready to give up the
reform and to return to the earlier, purely descriptive
judgement: man is a creature of weak
intelligence who is governed by his instinctual
wishes.</p>

<p class="c008">There is another point in which I wholeheartedly
agree with you. It is, to be sure, a
senseless proceeding to try and do away with
religion by force and at one blow—more especially
as it is a hopeless one. The believer will not let
his faith be taken from him, neither by arguments
nor by prohibitions. And even if it did succeed
with some, it would be a cruel thing to do. A
man who has for decades taken a sleeping
draught is naturally unable to sleep if he is deprived
of it. That the effect of the consolations
<span class="pageno" id="Page_85">85</span>of religion may be compared to that of a narcotic
is prettily illustrated by what is happening in
America. There they are now trying—plainly
under the influence of petticoat government—to
deprive men of all stimulants, intoxicants and
luxuries,<a id="r3"></a><a class="c007 pginternal" href="#f3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and to satiate them with piety by
way of compensation. This is another experiment
about the result of which we need not be
curious.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="f3">
<p class="c008"><a href="#r3" class="pginternal">3</a>. <em>I.e.</em> tea, alcohol, and tobacco.</p>
</div>

<p class="c008">And so I disagree with you when you go on to
argue that man cannot in general do without the
consolation of the religious illusion, that without
it he would not endure the troubles of life, the
cruelty of reality. Certainly this is true of the
man into whom you have instilled the sweet—or
bitter-sweet—poison from childhood on. But what
of the other, who has been brought up soberly?
Perhaps he, not suffering from neurosis, will need
no intoxicant to deaden it. True, man will then
find himself in a difficult situation. He will have
to confess his utter helplessness and his insignificant
part in the working of the universe; he will have
to confess that he is no longer the centre of creation,
no longer the object of the tender care of a benevolent
providence. He will be in the same
position as the child who has left the home where
<span class="pageno" id="Page_86">86</span>he was so warm and comfortable. But, after all,
is it not the destiny of childishness to be overcome?
Man cannot remain a child for ever; he
must venture at last into the hostile world.
This may be called ‘<em>education to reality</em>’; need
I tell you that it is the sole aim of my book
to draw attention to the necessity for this
advance?</p>

<p class="c008">You fear, probably, that he will not stand the
test? Well, anyhow, let us be hopeful. It is
at least something to know that one is thrown on
one’s own resources. One learns then to use them
properly. And man is not entirely without means
of assistance; since the time of the deluge science
has taught him much, and it will still further
increase his power. And as for the great necessities
of fate, against which there is no remedy, these
he will simply learn to endure with resignation.
Of what use to him is the illusion of a kingdom on
the moon, whose revenues have never yet been
seen by anyone? As an honest crofter on this
earth he will know how to cultivate his plot in a
way that will support him. Thus by withdrawing
his expectations from the other world and concentrating
all his liberated energies on this earthly
life he will probably attain to a state of things in
which life will be tolerable for all and no one will
<span class="pageno" id="Page_87">87</span>be oppressed by culture any more. Then with
one of our comrades in unbelief he will be able to
say without regret:</p>

<div class="nf-center-c0">
  <div class="nf-center">
    <div>Let us leave the heavens</div>
    <div>To the angels and the sparrows.</div>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_88">88</span>
  <h2 class="c005">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capa0_0_6 c006">‘That does sound splendid. A race of men
that has renounced all illusions and has
thus become capable of making its existence
on the earth a tolerable one! But I cannot
share your expectations. And this, not because
I am the pig-headed reactionary you perhaps take
me for. No; it is because I am a sensible person.
It seems to me that we have now exchanged rôles;
you prove to be the enthusiast, who allows himself
to be carried away by illusions, and I represent the
claims of reason, the right to be sceptical. What
you have just stated seems to me to be founded
on errors, which after your precedent I may call
illusions because they betray clearly enough the
influence of your wishes. You indulge in the hope
that generations which have not experienced the
influence of religious teaching in early childhood
will easily attain the wished-for primacy of the
intelligence over the life of the instincts. That
is surely an illusion; in this decisive point human
<span class="pageno" id="Page_89">89</span>nature is hardly likely to alter. If I am not
mistaken—one knows so little of other civilizations—there
are even to-day peoples who do not grow
up under the pressure of a religious system, and
they come no nearer your ideal than the others.
If you wish to expel religion from our European
civilization you can only do it through another
system of doctrines, and from the outset this
would take over all the psychological characteristics
of religion, the same sanctity, rigidity and
intolerance, the same prohibition of thought in
self-defence. Something of this sort you must have
in justice to the requirements of education. For
you cannot do without education. The way from
sucking child to civilized man is a long one; too
many young people would go astray and fail to
arrive at their life tasks in due time if they were
left without guidance to their own development.
The doctrines made use of in their education will
always confine the thought of their riper years,
exactly as you reproach religion with doing to-day.
Do you not observe that it is the ineradicable
natural defect of our, of every, culture that it
imposes on the child, governed by his instincts
and intellectually weak, the making of decisions
to which only the matured intelligence of the
grown-up can do justice? But owing to the fact
<span class="pageno" id="Page_90">90</span>that mankind’s development through the ages
is concentrated into a few years of childhood
culture cannot do otherwise, and it is only by
affective influence that the child can be induced
to accomplish the task assigned to it. And so
this is the outlook for your “primacy of the
intellect”.</p>

<p class="c008">‘And now you should not be surprised if I
intervene on behalf of retaining the religious
system of teaching as the basis of education and
of man’s communal life. It is a practical problem,
not a question of reality value. Since we cannot,
for the sake of the preservation of our culture,
postpone influencing the individual until he has
become ready for culture—many would never be
so anyhow—and since we are obliged to press some
system of teaching on the growing child which
shall have the effect on him of a postulate that
does not admit of criticism, it seems to me that
the religious system is by far the most suitable
for the purpose; of course just on account of that
quality—its power for wish-fulfilment and consolation—by
which you claim to have recognized
it as an “illusion”. In face of the difficulty of
discovering anything about reality, indeed the
doubt whether this is possible for us at all, we
must not overlook the fact that human needs
<span class="pageno" id="Page_91">91</span>are also a part, and indeed an important part,
of reality, and one that concerns us particularly
closely.</p>

<p class="c008">‘I find another advantage of religious doctrine
in one of its peculiarities, to which you seem to
take particular exception. It admits of an ideational
refinement and sublimation, by which it
can be divested of most of those traces of a primitive
and infantile way of thinking which it bears.
What is then left is a body of ideas which science
no longer contradicts and which it cannot disprove.
These modifications of religious doctrine,
which you have condemned as half-measures and
compromises, make it possible to bridge the gap
between the uneducated masses and the philosophical
thinker, and to preserve that common
bond between them which is so important for the
protection of culture. With it you would have
no need to fear that the poor man would discover
that the upper strata of society “no longer believe
in God”. I think I have shown by now that
your endeavour reduces itself to the attempt to
replace a proved and affectively valuable illusion
by one that is improved and without affective
value.’</p>

<p class="c008">You shall not find me impervious to your
criticism. I know how difficult it is to avoid
<span class="pageno" id="Page_92">92</span>illusions; perhaps even the hopes I have confessed
to are of an illusory nature. But I hold fast to
one distinction. My illusions—apart from the
fact that no penalty is imposed for not sharing
them—are not, like the religious ones, incapable
of correction, they have no delusional character.
If experience should show—not to me, but to
others after me who think as I do—that we are
mistaken, then we shall give up our expectations.
Take my endeavour for what it is. A psychologist,
who does not deceive himself about the
difficulty of finding his bearings in this world,
strives to review the development of mankind in
accord with what insight he has won from studying
the mental processes of the individual during his
development from childhood to manhood. In
this connection the idea forces itself upon him
that religion is comparable to a childhood neurosis,
and he is optimistic enough to assume that mankind
will overcome this neurotic phase, just as so
many children grow out of their similar neuroses.
These pieces of knowledge from individual psychology
may be inadequate, their application to the
human race unjustified, the optimism without
foundation; I grant you the uncertainty of all
these things. But often we cannot refrain from
saying what we think, excusing ourselves on the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_93">93</span>ground that it is given for no more than it is
worth.</p>

<p class="c008">And there are two points that I must dwell on
a little longer. First, the weakness of my position
does not betoken any strengthening of yours. I
think you are defending a lost cause. We may
insist as much as we like that the human intellect
is weak in comparison with human instincts, and
be right in doing so. But nevertheless there is
something peculiar about this weakness. The
voice of the intellect is a soft one, but it does not
rest until it has gained a hearing. Ultimately,
after endlessly repeated rebuffs, it succeeds. This
is one of the few points in which one may be
optimistic about the future of mankind, but in
itself it signifies not a little. And one can make
it a starting-point for yet other hopes. The
primacy of the intellect certainly lies in the far,
far, but still probably not infinite, distance. And
as it will presumably set itself the same aims that
you expect to be realized by your God—of course
within human limits, in so far as external reality,
Ἀνάγκη, allows it—the brotherhood of man and
the reduction of suffering, we may say that our
antagonism is only a temporary and not an irreconcilable
one. We desire the same things, but you
are more impatient, more exacting, and—why
<span class="pageno" id="Page_94">94</span>should I not say it—more selfish than I and those
like me. You would have the state of bliss to
begin immediately after death; you ask of it the
impossible, and you will not surrender the claim
of the individual. Of these wishes our god Αόγος<a id="r4"></a><a class="c007 pginternal" href="#f4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
will realize those which external nature permits,
but he will do this very gradually, only in the
incalculable future and for other children of men.
Compensation for us, who suffer grievously from
life, he does not promise. On the way to this
distant goal your religious doctrines will have to
be discarded, no matter whether the first attempts
fail, or whether the first substitute-formations
prove to be unstable. You know why; in the
long run nothing can withstand reason and experience,
and the contradiction religion offers to both
is only too palpable. Not even the purified
religious ideas can escape this fate, so long as they
still try to preserve anything of the consolation
of religion. Certainly if you confine yourself to
the belief in a higher spiritual being, whose
qualities are indefinable and whose intentions
cannot be discerned, then you are proof against
the interference of science, but then you will also
relinquish the interest of men.</p>

<p class="c008"><a href="#r4" class="pginternal">4</a>. The twin gods Αόγος-Ἀνάγκη of the Dutchman <em>Multatuli</em>.</p>
</div>

<p class="c008">And secondly: note the difference between
<span class="pageno" id="Page_95">95</span>your attitude to illusions and mine. You have
to defend the religious illusion with all your might;
if it were discredited—and to be sure it is sufficiently
menaced—then your world would collapse, there
would be nothing left for you but to despair of
everything, of culture and of the future of mankind.
From this bondage I am, we are, free. Since we
are prepared to renounce a good part of our
infantile wishes, we can bear it if some of our
expectations prove to be illusions.</p>

<p class="c008">Education freed from the burden of religious
doctrines will not perhaps effect much alteration
in man’s psychological nature; our god Αόγος is
not perhaps a very powerful one; he may only
fulfil a small part of what his forerunners have
promised. If we have to acknowledge this, we
shall do so with resignation. We shall not thereby
lose our interest in the world and in life, for we
have in one respect a sure support which you lack.
We believe that it is possible for scientific work
to discover something about the reality of the
world through which we can increase our power
and according to which we can regulate our life.
If this belief is an illusion, then we are in the
same position as you, but science has shown us by
numerous and significant successes that it is no
illusion. Science has many open, and still more
<span class="pageno" id="Page_96">96</span>secret, enemies among those who cannot forgive
it for having weakened religious belief and for
threatening to overthrow it. People reproach it
for the small amount it has taught us and the
incomparably greater amount it has left in the
dark. But then they forget how young it is,
how difficult its beginnings, and how infinitesimally
small the space of time since the human
intellect has been strong enough for the tasks it
sets it. Do we not all do wrong in that the
periods of time which we make the basis of our
judgements are of too short duration? We should
take an example from the geologist. People complain
of the unreliability of science, that she
proclaims as a law to-day what the next generation
will recognize to be an error and which it will
replace by a new law of equally short currency.
But that is unjust and in part untrue. The transformation
of scientific ideas is a process of development
and progress, not of revolution. A law that
was at first held to be universally valid proves
to be a special case of a more comprehensive law,
or else its scope is limited by another law not
discovered until later; a rough approximation
to the truth is replaced by one more carefully
adjusted, which in its turn awaits a further approach
to perfection. In several spheres we have not
<span class="pageno" id="Page_97">97</span>yet surmounted a phase of investigation in which
we test hypotheses that have soon to be rejected
as inadequate; but in others we have already an
assured and almost immutable core of knowledge.
Finally an attempt has been made to discredit
radically scientific endeavour on the ground that,
bound as it is to the conditions of our own organization,
it can yield nothing but subjective results,
while the real nature of things outside us remains
inaccessible to it. But this is to disregard several
factors of decisive importance for the understanding
of scientific work. Firstly, our organization, <em>i.e.</em>
our mental apparatus, has been developed actually
in the attempt to explore the outer world, and
therefore it must have realized in its structure a
certain measure of appropriateness; secondly,
it itself is a constituent part of that world
which we are to investigate, and readily admits
of such investigation; thirdly, the task of science
is fully circumscribed if we confine it to showing
how the world must appear to us in consequence
of the particular character of our organization;
fourthly, the ultimate findings of science, just
because of the way in which they are attained,
are conditioned not only by our organization
but also by that which has affected this organization;
and, finally, the problem of the nature
<span class="pageno" id="Page_98">98</span>of the world irrespective of our perceptive
mental apparatus is an empty abstraction without
practical interest.</p>

<p class="c008">No, science is no illusion. But it would be an
illusion to suppose that we could get anywhere
else what it cannot give us.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
