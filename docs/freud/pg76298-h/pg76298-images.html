<p class="c004">If in what follows I bring any contribution to the history of
the psychoanalytic movement nobody must be surprised at the subjective
nature of this paper, nor at the rôle which falls to me
therein. For psychoanalysis is my creation; for ten years I was
the only one occupied with it, and all the annoyance which this new
subject caused among my contemporaries has been hurled upon my
head in the form of criticism. Even today, when I am no longer
the only psychoanalyst, I feel myself justified in assuming that none
can know better than myself what psychoanalysis is, wherein it
differs from other methods of investigating the psychic life, what
its name should cover, or what might better be designated as something
else.</p>

<p class="c005">In the year 1909, when I was first privileged to speak publicly
on psychoanalysis in an American University, fired by this momentous
occasion for my endeavors, I declared that it was not
myself who brought psychoanalysis into existence. I said that it
was Josef Breuer, who had merited this honor at a time when I
was a student and busy working for my examinations (1880–1882).<a id="r1"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Since then, well-intentioned friends have frequently repeated that
I then expressed my gratitude out of all due proportion. They
considered that, as on previous occasions, I should have dignified
Breuer’s “cathartic procedure” as merely preliminary to psychoanalysis,
and should have claimed that psychoanalysis itself only
began with my rejection of the hypnotic technique and my introduction
of free association. Now it is really a matter of indifference
whether the history of psychoanalysis be considered to have
started with the cathartic method or only with my modification of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_2">2</span>the same. I only enter into this uninteresting question because
some opponents of psychoanalysis are wont to recall, now and then,
that the art of psychoanalysis did not originate with me at all, but
with Breuer. Naturally, this only happens to be the case when
their attitude permits them to find in psychoanalysis something that
is noteworthy; on the other hand when their repudiation of psychoanalysis
is unlimited, then psychoanalysis is always indisputably
my creation. I have never yet heard that Breuer’s great part in
psychoanalysis has brought him an equal measure of insult and reproach.
As I have recognized long since that it is the inevitable
fate of psychoanalysis to arouse opposition and to embitter people,
I have come to the conclusion that I must surely be the originator
of all that characterizes psychoanalysis. I add, with satisfaction,
that none of the attempts to belittle my share in this much disdained
psychoanalysis has ever come from Breuer himself, or could
boast of his support.</p>

<p class="c005">The content of Breuer’s discovery has been so often presented
that a detailed discussion of it here may be omitted. Its fundamental
fact is that the symptoms of hysterical patients depend upon
impressive but forgotten scenes in their lives (traumata). The
therapy founded thereon was to cause the patients to recall and
reproduce these experiences under hypnosis (catharsis), and the
fragmentary theory, deduced from it was that these symptoms corresponded
to an abnormal use of undischarged sums of excitement
(conversion). In his theoretical contribution to the “Studies of
Hysteria” Breuer, wherever obliged to mention <em>conversion</em>, has
always added my name in parenthesis, as though this first attempt
at a theoretical formulation was my mental property. I think this
allotment refers only to the nomenclature, whilst the conception
itself occurred to us both at the same time.</p>

<p class="c005">It is also well known that Breuer, after his first experience with
it, allowed the cathartic treatment to rest for a number of years
and only resumed it after I caused him to do so, on my return from
Charcot. He was then an internist and taken up with a rather
busy medical practice. I had become a physician quite reluctantly
<span class="pageno" id="Page_3">3</span>but had, at that time, received a strong motive for desiring to help
nervous patients or, at least, to learn to understand something of
their conditions. I had placed reliance on physical therapy and
found myself helpless in the face of disappointments that came to
me with W. Erb’s “Electrotherapy,” so rich in advice and indications.
If I did not, at that time, pilot myself independently to the
opinion later announced by Moebius, that the successes of electrotherapy
in nervous disorders are the results of suggestion, it was
surely only the absence of these successes that was to blame. The
treatment by <em>suggestion</em> in deep hypnosis seemed to offer me at that
time sufficient compensation for the lost electrical therapy. I
learned this treatment through the extremely impressive demonstrations
of Liébault and Bernheim. But the investigation under
hypnosis with which I became acquainted through Breuer, I found,
owing to its automatic manner of working and the simultaneous
gratification of one’s eagerness for knowledge, much more attractive
than the monotonous and violent suggestive command which was
devoid of every possibility of inquiry.</p>

<p class="c005">As one of the latest achievements of psychoanalysis, we have
lately been admonished to put the actual conflict and the cause of
the illness into the foreground of analysis. This is exactly what
Breuer and I did in the beginning of our work with the cathartic
method. We guided the patient’s attention directly to the traumatic
scene during which the symptom had arisen, tried to find therein
the psychic conflict and to free the repressed affect. We thus discovered
the procedure characteristic of the psychic processes of the
neuroses which I later named <em>regression</em>. The associations of the
patients went back from the scene to be explained, to earlier experiences,
and this forced the analysis which was to correct the present
to occupy itself with the past. This regression led even further
backwards. At first it went quite regularly to the time of puberty.
Later, however, such failures as gaps in the understanding tempted
the analytic work further back into the years of childhood which
had, hitherto, been inaccessible to every sort of investigation. This
regressive direction became an important characteristic of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_4">4</span>analysis. It was proved that psychoanalysis could not clear up
anything actual, except by going back to something in the past. It
even proved that every pathological experience presupposes an
earlier one which, though not in itself pathological, lent a pathological
quality to the later occurrence. But the temptation to stop
short at the known actual cause was so great that even in later
analyses I yielded to it. In the case of the patient called “Dora,”
carried out in 1899, the scene which caused the outbreak of the
actual illness was known to me. I tried uncounted times to analyse
this experience, but all that I could receive to my direct demands
was the same scanty and broken description. Only after a long
detour, which led through the earliest childhood of the patient, a
dream appeared in the analysis of which the hitherto forgotten
details of the scene were remembered, and this made possible the
understanding and solution of the actual conflict.</p>

<p class="c005">From this one example it may be seen how misleading is the
above mentioned admonition and how much of a scientific regression
it is to follow the advice of neglecting the regression in the analytic
technique.</p>

<p class="c005">The first difference of opinion between Breuer and myself came
to light on a question of the more intimate psychic mechanism of
hysteria. He still favored a physiological theory, so to speak, and
wished to explain the psychic splitting of consciousness of hysterical
subjects by means of the non-communication of various psychic
states (or states of consciousness, as we then called them). He
thus created the theory of the “hypnoid states,” the results of which
were supposed to bring the unassimilated foreign body into the
“waking consciousness.” I had formulated this to myself less
scientifically. I suspected everywhere tendencies and strivings
analogous to those of everyday life and conceived the psychic splitting
itself as a result of a repelling process, which I then called
“defense” and later “regression.” I made a short-lived attempt
to reconcile both mechanisms, but as experience showed me always
the same and only one thing, my defense theory, I soon became
opposed to Breuer’s theory of hypnoid states.</p>

<p class="c005"><span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span>I am, however, quite certain that this difference of opinion had
nothing to do with the parting of the ways which occurred soon
afterward between us. The latter had a deeper reason, but it
happened in such a manner that at first I did not understand it, and
only later did I learn to interpret it, following many good indexes.
It will be recalled that Breuer had stated, concerning his first
famous patient, that the sexual element had been astonishingly
undeveloped in her and had never contributed anything to her very
marked morbid picture.<a id="r2"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> I have always wondered why the critics
of my theory of the sexual etiology of the neuroses have not often
opposed it with this assertion of Breuer, and up to this day I do not
know whether in this reticence I am to see a proof of their discretion,
or of their lack of observation. Whoever will reread the history
of Breuer’s patient in the light of the experience gained in the
last twenty years, will have no difficulty in understanding the symbolism
of the snakes and of the arm. By taking into account also
the situation at the sick-bed of the father, he will easily guess the
actual meaning of that symptom-formation. His opinion as to the
part sexuality played in the psychic life of that girl will then differ
greatly from that of her physician. To cure the patient Breuer
utilized the most intensive suggestive <em>rapport</em> which may serve us
as prototype of that which we call “transference.” Now I have
strong grounds to suppose that Breuer, after the disposal of the
symptoms, must have discovered the sexual motivity of this transference
by new signs, but that the general nature of this unexpected
phenomenon escaped him, so that here, as though hit by “an
untoward event,” he broke off the investigation. I did not obtain
from him any direct information of this, but at different times he
has given me sufficient connecting links to justify me in making this
combination. And then, as I stood more and more decidedly for
the significance of sexuality in the causation of the neuroses, Breuer
was the first to show me those reactions of unwilling rejection, with
which it was my lot to become so familiar later on, but which I had
then not yet recognized as my unavoidable destiny.</p>

<p class="c005"><span class="pageno" id="Page_6">6</span>The fact that a grossly sexual, tender or inimical, transference
occurs in every treatment of a neurosis, although this was neither
desired nor induced by either party, has, for me, always seemed
to be the most unshakable proof that the forces of the neuroses
originate in the sexual life. This argument has surely not been
seriously enough considered, for if it were, there would be no question
as to where the investigation would tend. For my own conviction,
it has remained decisive over and above the special results
of the work of the analysis.</p>

<p class="c005">Some comfort for the bad reception which my theory of the
sexual etiology of the neuroses met with, even in the closer circle of
my friends—a negative space was soon formed about my person—I
found in the thought that I had taken up the fight for a new and
original idea. One day, however, my memories grouped themselves
in such a way that this satisfaction was disturbed, but in
return I obtained an excellent insight into the origin of our activities
and into the nature of our knowledge. The idea for which I
was held responsible had not at all originated with me. It had come
to me from three persons, whose opinions could count upon my
deepest respect; from Breuer himself, from Charcot, and from
Chrobak, the gynecologist of our university, probably the most
prominent of our Vienna physicians. All three men had imparted
to me an insight which, strictly speaking, they had not themselves
possessed. Two of them denied their communication to me when
later I reminded them of this: the third (Master Charcot) might
also have done so, had it been granted me to see him again. But
these identical communications, received without my grasping them,
had lain dormant within me, until one day they awoke as an apparently
original discovery.</p>

<p class="c005">One day, while I was a young hospital doctor, I was accompanying
Breuer on a walk through the town when a man came up to him
urgently desiring to speak with him. I fell back and, when Breuer
was free again, he told me, in his kindly, teacher-like manner, that
this was the husband of a patient, who had brought him some news
about her. The wife, he added, behaved in so conspicuous a manner
<span class="pageno" id="Page_7">7</span>when in company, that she had been turned over to him for treatment
as a nervous case. He ended with the remark—“those are
always secrets of the alcove.” Astonished, I asked his meaning
and he explained the expression to me (“secrets of the conjugal
bed”), without realizing how preposterous the matter appeared to
me.</p>

<p class="c005">A few years later, at one of Charcot’s evening receptions, I found
myself near the venerated teacher who was just relating to Brouardel
a very interesting history from the day’s practice. I did not hear
the beginning clearly but gradually the story obtained my attention.
It was the case of a young married couple from the far East. The
wife was a great sufferer and the husband was impotent, or exceedingly
awkward. I heard Charcot repeat: “<span lang="fr">Tâchez donc, je vous
assure vous y arriverez.</span>” Brouardel, who spoke less distinctly,
must have expressed his astonishment that symptoms as those of
the young wife should have appeared as a result of such circumstances,
for Charcot said suddenly and with great vivacity: “<span lang="fr">Mais,
dans des cas pareils c’est toujours la chose génital, toujours—toujours—toujours.</span>”
And while saying that he crossed his hands in
his lap and jumped up and down several times, with the vivacity peculiar
to him. I know that for a moment I was almost paralyzed
with astonishment, and I said to myself: “Yes, but if he knows
this why does he never say so?” But the impression was soon forgotten;
brain-anatomy and the experimental production of hysterical
paralysis absorbed all my interests.</p>

<p class="c005">A year later when I had begun my medical activities in Vienna
as a private <em>dozent</em> in nervous diseases I was as innocent and ignorant
in all that concerned the etiology of the neuroses as any
promising academician could be expected to be. One day I received
a friendly call from Chrobak, who asked me to take a patient
to whom he could not give sufficient time in his new capacity as lecturer
at the university. I reached the patient before he did and
learned that she suffered from senseless attacks of anxiety, which
could only be alleviated by the most exact information as to the
whereabouts of her physician at any time in the day. When Chrobak
<span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>appeared, he took me aside and disclosed to me that the patient’s
anxiety was due to the fact that though she had been married
eighteen years, she was still a <em>virgo intacta</em>, that her husband was
utterly impotent. In such cases the physician can only cover the
domestic mishap with his reputation and must bear it if people
shrug their shoulders and say of him: “He is not a good doctor if
in all these years, he has not been able to cure her.” He added:
“The only prescription for such troubles is the one well known to
us, but which we cannot prescribe. It is:</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c010">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span lang="la">Penis normalis</span></div>
      <div class="line in4"><span lang="la">dosim</span></div>
      <div class="line"><span lang="la">Repetatur!</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c005">I had never heard of such a prescription and would like to have
shaken my head at my informant’s cynicism.</p>

<p class="c005">I certainly have not uncovered the illustrious origins of this
vicious idea because I would like to shove the responsibility for it
on others. I know well that it is one thing to express an idea once
or several times in the form of a rapid <em>aperçu</em>, and quite another to
take it seriously and literally to lead it through all opposing details
and conquer for it a place among accepted truths. It is the difference
between a light flirtation and a righteous marriage with all its
duties and difficulties. <span lang="fr">Epouser les idées de</span>—(to marry so and so’s
ideas,) is, at least in French, a quite usual form of speech.</p>

<p class="c005">Other doctrines which were contributed to the cathartic method
through my efforts thus transforming it into psychoanalysis, are
the following: The theories of repression and resistance, the addition
of the infantile sexuality, and the usage and interpretation of
dreams for the understanding of the unconscious.</p>

<p class="c005">Concerning the theory of repression, I was certain that I worked
independently. I knew of no influence that directed me in any way
to it, and I long considered this idea to be original, till O. Rank
showed us the place in Schopenhauer’s “The World as Will and
Idea,” where the philosopher is struggling for an explanation for insanity.<a id="r3"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_9">9</span>What is there said concerning the striving against the acceptance
of a painful piece of reality agrees so completely with the
content of my theory of repression that, once again, I must be indebted
to my not being well-read for the possibility of making a discovery.
To be sure, others have read this passage and overlooked
it, without making this discovery and perhaps the same would have
happened to me, if, in former years, I had taken more pleasure in
reading philosophical authors. In later years I denied myself the
great pleasure of Nietzsche’s works, with the conscious motive of
not wishing to be hindered in the working out of my psychoanalytic
impressions by any preconceived ideas. Therefore, I had to be prepared—and
am so gladly—to renounce all claim to priority in those
many cases in which the laborious psychoanalytic investigation can
only confirm the insights intuitively won by the philosophers.</p>

<p class="c005">The theory of repression is the main pillar upon which rests
the edifice of psychoanalysis. It is really the most essential part of
it, and is itself nothing other than the theoretical expression of an
experience which can be repeated at pleasure whenever one analyzes
a neurotic patient without the aid of hypnosis. One is then confronted
with a resistance which opposes the analytic work by causing
a failure of memory in order to block it. This resistance had
to be covered by the use of hypnosis; hence the history of psychoanalysis
proper only starts technically with the rejection of hypnosis.
The theoretical value of the fact that this resistance is connected
with an amnesia leads unavoidably to that conception of the unconscious
psychic activities which is peculiar to psychoanalysis, and
distinguishes it markedly from the philosophical speculations about
the unconscious. It may, therefore, be said that the psychoanalytic
theory endeavors to explain two experiences, which result in a striking
and unexpected manner during the attempt to trace back the
morbid symptoms of a neurotic to their source in his life-history;
viz., the facts of transference and of resistance. Every investigation
which recognizes these two facts and makes them the starting
points of its work may call itself psychoanalysis, even if it lead to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>other results than my own. But whoever takes up other sides of the
problem and deviates from these two assumptions will hardly escape
the charge of interfering with the rights of ownership through attempted
imitation, if he insist upon calling himself a psychoanalyst.</p>

<p class="c005">I would very energetically oppose any attempt to count the
principles of repression and resistance as mere assumptions instead
of results of psychoanalysis. Such assumptions of a general psychological
and biological nature exist, and it would be quite to the
point to deal with them in another place. The principle of repression,
however, is an acquisition of the psychoanalytic work, won by
legitimate means, as a theoretical extract from very numerous experiences.
Just such an acquisition, but of much later days, is the
theory of the infantile sexuality, of which no count was taken during
the first years of tentative analytic investigation. At first it was
only noticed that the effect of actual impressions had to be traced
back to the past. However, “the seeker often found more than he
bargained for.” He was tempted always further back into this past
and finally hoped to be permitted to tarry in the period of puberty,
the epoch of the traditional awakening of the sexual impulses. His
hopes were in vain. The tracks led still further back into childhood
and into its earliest years. In the process of this work it became
almost fatal for this young science. Under the influence of the
traumatic theory of hysteria, following Charcot, one was easily inclined
to regard as real and as of etiological importance the accounts
of patients who traced back their symptoms to passive sexual occurrences
in the first years of childhood, that is to say, speaking plainly,
to seductions. When this etiology broke down through its own unlikelihood,
and through the contradiction of well-established circumstances,
there followed a period of absolute helplessness. The analysis
had led by the correct path to such infantile sexual traumas,
and yet these were not true. Thus the basis of reality had been lost.
At that time I would gladly have let the whole thing slide, as did my
respected forerunner Breuer, when he made his unwished-for discovery.
Perhaps I persevered only because I had no longer any
choice of beginning something else. Finally I reflected that, after
<span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>all, no one has a right to despair if he has been disappointed only in
his expectations. He merely needs to review them. If hysterics
refer their symptoms to imaginary traumas, then this new fact signifies
that they create such scenes in their phantasies, and hence
psychic reality deserves to be given a place next to actual reality.
This was soon followed by the conviction that these phantasies
serve to hide the autoerotic activities of the early years of childhood,
to idealize them and place them on a higher level, and now the
whole sexual life of the child made its appearance behind these phantasies.</p>

<p class="c005">In this sexual activity of the first years of childhood, the concomitant
constitution could finally attain its rights. Disposition and
experience here became associated into an inseparable etiological
unity, in that the disposition raised certain impressions to inciting
and fixed traumas, which otherwise would have remained altogether
banal and ineffectual, whilst the experiences evoked factors from
the disposition which, without them, would have continued to remain
dormant, and, perhaps, undeveloped. The last word in the
question of traumatic etiology was later on said by Abraham, when
he drew attention to the fact that just the peculiar nature of the
child’s sexual constitution enables it to provoke sexual experiences
of a peculiar kind, that is to say, traumas.</p>

<p class="c005">My formulations concerning the sexuality of the child were
founded at first almost exclusively on the results of the analyses of
adults, which led back into the past. I was lacking in opportunity
for direct observation of the child. It was, therefore, an extraordinary
triumph when, years later, my discoveries were successfully
confirmed for the greater part by direct observation and analyses of
children of very early years, a triumph that appeared less and less
on reflecting that the discovery was of such a nature that one really
ought to be ashamed of having made it. The deeper one penetrated
into the observation of the child, the more self-evident this fact
seemed, and the more strange, too, became the circumstances that
such pains had been taken to overlook it.</p>

<p class="c005">To be sure, so certain a conviction of the existence and significance
<span class="pageno" id="Page_12">12</span>of the infantile sexuality can be obtained only, if one follows
the path of analysis, if one goes back from the symptoms and
peculiarities of neurotics to their uttermost sources, the discovery
of which explains what is explainable in them, and permits of modifying
what can be changed. I understand that one can arrive at different
conclusions if, as was recently done by C. G. Jung, one first
forms for one’s self a theoretical conception of the nature of the
sexual impulse and thereby tries to understand the life of the child.
Such a conception can only be chosen arbitrarily or with regard to
secondary considerations, and is in danger of becoming inadequate
to the sphere in which it was to be utilized. Doubtless, the analytic
way also leads to certain final difficulties and obscurities in regard
to sexuality and its relation to the whole life of the individual; but
these cannot be set aside by speculations, and must wait till solutions
will be found by means of other observations or of observations in
other spheres.</p>

<p class="c005">I shall briefly discuss the history of dream interpretation. This
came to me as the first-fruits of the technical innovation, after, following
a dim presentiment, I had decided to replace hypnosis with
free associations. It was not the understanding of dreams towards
which my curiosity was originally directed. I do not know of any
influences which had guided my interest to this or inspired me with
any helpful expectations. Before the cessation of my intercourse
with Breuer I hardly had time to tell him, in so many words, that I
now knew how to translate dreams. During the development of
these discoveries the symbolism of the language of dreams was
about the last thing which became known to me, since, for the understanding
of symbols, the associations of the dreamer offer but little
help. As I have held fast to the habit of first studying things themselves,
before looking them up in books, I was able to ascertain for
myself the symbolism of dreams before I was directed to it by the
work of Sherner. Only later I came to value fully this means of
expression of dreams. This was partly due to the influence of the
works of Stekel, who was at first very meritorious but who later
became most perfunctory. The close connection between the psychoanalytic
<span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span>interpretation of dreams and the once so highly esteemed
art of dream interpretation of the ancients only became clear to me
many years afterwards. The most characteristic and significant
portion of my dream theory, namely, the reduction of the dream distortion
to an inner conflict, to a sort of inner dishonesty, I found
later in an author to whom medicine but not philosophy is unknown.
I refer to the engineer J. Popper, who had published “Phantasies
of a Realist” under the name of Lynkeus.</p>

<p class="c005">The interpretation of dreams became for me a solace and support
in those difficult first years of analysis, when I had to master
at the same time the technique, the clinic and the therapy of the
neuroses, when I stood entirely alone, and in the confusion of problems
and the accumulation of difficulties I often feared to lose my
orientation and my confidence. It often took a long time before
the proof of my assumption, that a neurosis must become comprehensible
through analysis, was seen by the perplexed patient, but
the dreams, which might be regarded as analogous to the symptoms,
almost regularly confirmed this assumption.</p>

<p class="c005">Only because of these successes was I in condition to persevere.
I have, therefore, acquired the habit of measuring the grasp of a
psychological worker by his attitude to the problem of dream interpretation,
and I have noticed, with satisfaction, that most of the opponents
of psychoanalysis avoided this field altogether, or if they
ventured into it, they behaved most awkwardly. The analysis of
myself, the need of which soon became apparent to me, I carried out
by the aid of a series of my own dreams which led me through all
the happenings of my childhood years. Even today I am of the
opinion that in the case of a prolific dreamer and a person not too
abnormal, this sort of analysis may be sufficient.</p>

<p class="c005">By unfurling this developmental history, I believe I have shown
what psychoanalysis is, better than I could have done by a systematic
presentation of the subject. The special nature of my findings I
did not then recognize. I sacrificed, unhesitatingly, my budding
popularity as a physician and an extensive practice among nervous
patients, because I searched directly for the sexual origin of their
<span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>neuroses. In this way I gained a number of experiences which
definitely confirmed my conviction of the practical significance of
the sexual factor. Without any apprehension, I appeared as
speaker at the Vienna Neurological Society, then under the presidency
of Krafft-Ebing, expecting to be compensated, by the interest
and recognition of my colleagues, for my own voluntary sacrifices.
I treated my discoveries as indifferent contributions to science and
hoped that others would treat them in the same way. Only the
silence that followed my lectures, the space that formed about my
person, and the insinuations directed towards me caused me to
realize, gradually, that statements about the part played by sexuality
in the etiology of the neuroses cannot hope to be treated like other
communications. I realized that from then on I would belong to
those who, according to Hebbel’s expression, “have disturbed the
world’s sleep,” and that I could not count upon being treated objectively
and with toleration. But as my conviction of the average
correctness of my observations and the conclusions grew greater
and greater, and as my faith in my own judgment was not small,
any more than was my moral courage, there could be no doubt as to
the issue of this situation. I decided to believe that it fell to my
lot to discover particularly significant associations, and felt prepared
to bear the fate which sometimes accompanies such discoveries.</p>

<p class="c005">This fate I pictured to myself in the following manner. I would
probably succeed in sustaining myself through the therapeutic successes
of the new treatment, but science would take no notice of
me in my lifetime. Some decades later, another would surely
stumble upon the same, now untimely things, compel their recognition
and thus bring me to honor as a necessarily unfortunate forerunner.
Meantime I arrayed myself as comfortably as possible à la Robinson
Crusoe upon my lonely island. When I look back to those lonely
years, from the perplexities and vexatiousness of the present, it
seems to me it was a beautiful and heroic time. The “splendid isolation”
did not lack its privileges and charms. I did not need to
read any literature nor to listen to badly informed opponents. I
was subject to no influences, and no pressure was brought to bear
<span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>on me. I learned to restrain speculative tendencies and, following
the unforgotten advice of my master, Charcot, I looked at the same
things again and often until they began of themselves to tell me
something. My publications, for which I found shelter despite
some difficulty, could safely remain far behind my state of knowledge.
They could be delayed as long as I pleased, as there was no
doubtful “priority” to be defended. “The Interpretation of
Dreams,” for example, was completed in all essentials in the beginning
of 1896, but was written down only in 1899. The treatment
of “Dora” was finished at the end of 1899. The history of her
illness was completed in the next two weeks, but was only published
in 1905. Meantime my writings were not in the reviewed professional
literature of the day. If an exception was made they were
always treated with scornful or pitying condescension. Sometimes
a colleague would refer to me in one of his publications in very
short and unflattering terms, such as “unbalanced,” “extreme,” or
“very odd.” It happened once that an assistant at the clinic in
Vienna asked me for permission to attend one of my lecture courses.
He listened devoutly and said nothing, but after the last lecture he
offered to accompany me. During this walk he disclosed to me
that, with the knowledge of his chief, he had written a book against
my teachings, but he expressed much regret that he had only come
to know these teachings better through my lectures. Had he known
these before, he would have written very differently. Indeed, he
had inquired at the clinic if he had not better first read “The Interpretation
of Dreams,” but had been advised against doing so, as
it was not worth the trouble. As he now understood it, he compared
my system of instruction with the Catholic Church. In the interests
of his soul’s salvation I will assume that this remark contained a bit
of sincere recognition. But he ended by saying that it was too late
to alter anything in his book as it was already printed. This particular
colleague did not consider it necessary later on to tell the world
something of the change in his opinions concerning my psychoanalysis.
On the contrary, as permanent reviewer of a medical journal,
he showed a preference to follow its development with his hardly
serious comments.</p>

<p class="c005"><span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>Whatever I possessed of personal sensitiveness was blunted in
those years, to my advantage. But I was saved from becoming embittered
by a circumstance that does not come to the assistance of
all lonely discoverers. Such a one usually frets himself to find out
the cause of the lack of sympathy or of the rejection he receives from
his contemporaries, and perceives them as a painful contradiction
against the certainty of his own conviction. That did not trouble
me, for the psychoanalytic fundamental principles enabled me to
understand this attitude of my environment as a necessary sequence.
If it was true that the associations discovered by me were kept from
the knowledge of the patient by inner affective resistances, then this
resistance must manifest itself also in normal persons as soon as the
repressed material is conveyed to them from the outside. It was not
strange that these latter knew how to give intellectual reasons for
their affective rejections of my ideas. This happened just as often
with the patients, and the arguments advanced—arguments are as
common as blackberries, to borrow from Falstaff’s speech—were
the same and not exactly brilliant. The only difference was that in
the case of patients one had the means of bringing pressure to bear,
in order to help them recognize and overcome their resistances, but
in the case of those seemingly normal, such help had to be omitted.
To force these normal people to a cool and scientifically objective
examination of the subject was an unsolved problem, the solution of
which was best left to time. In the history of science it has often
been possible to verify that the very assertion which, at first, called
forth only opposition, received recognition a little later without the
necessity of bringing forward any new proofs.</p>

<p class="c005">That I have not developed any particular respect for the opinion
of the world or any desire for intellectual deference during those
years, when I alone represented psychoanalysis, will surprise no one.</p>

<div class="chapter">

  <h2 class="c008">II</h2>
</div>

<p class="c004">Beginning with the year 1902 a number of young doctors crowded
about me with the expressed intention to learn psychoanalysis, to
practice it and to spread it. The impetus for this came from a colleague
who had himself experienced the beneficial effects of the analytic
therapy. We met on certain evenings at my residence, and
discussed subjects according to certain rules. The visitors endeavored
to orient themselves in this strange and new realm of investigation,
and to interest others in the matter. One day a young graduate
of the technical school found admission to our circle by means of a
manuscript which showed extraordinary sense. We induced him to
go through college and enter the university, and then devote himself
to the non-medical application of psychoanalysis. Thus the little
society gained a zealous and reliable secretary, and I acquired in
Otto Rank a most faithful helper and collaborator.</p>

<p class="c005">Soon the little circle expanded, and in the course of the next few
years changed a good deal in its composition. On the whole, I could
flatter myself that in the wealth and variety of talent our circle was
hardly inferior to the staff of any clinical teacher. From the very beginning
it included those men who later were to play a considerable, if
not always a delectable, part in the history of the psychoanalytic
movement. But these developments could not have been guessed at
that time. I was satisfied, and I believe I did all I could, to convey to
the others what I knew and had experienced. There were only two
inauspicious circumstances which at least mentally estranged me
from this circle. I could not succeed in establishing among the members
that friendly relation which should obtain among men doing the
same difficult work, nor could I crush out the quarrels about the
priority of discoveries, for which there were ample opportunities
in those conditions of working together. The difficulties of teaching
the practise of psychoanalysis, which are particularly great, and
are often to blame for the present rejection of psychoanalysis,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>already made themselves felt in this Viennese private psychoanalytic
society. I myself did not dare to present an as yet incomplete technique,
and a theory still in the making, with that authority which
might have spared the others many a blind alley and many a final
tripping up. The self-dependence of mental workers, their early
independence of the teacher, is always gratifying psychologically,
but it can only result in a scientific gain when during these labors
certain, not too frequently occurring, personal relations are also fulfilled.
Psychoanalysis particularly should have required a long and
severe discipline and training of self-control. On account of the
courage displayed in devotion to so ridiculed and fruitless a subject,
I was inclined to tolerate among the members much to which
otherwise I would have objected. Besides, the circle included
not only physicians, but other cultured men who had recognized
something significant in psychoanalysis. There were authors, artists,
and so forth. The “Interpretation of Dreams,” the book on
“Wit,” and other writings, had already shown that the principles of
psychoanalysis cannot remain limited to the medical field, but are
capable of application to various other mental sciences.</p>

<p class="c005">In 1907 the situation suddenly altered and quite contrary to all
expectations; it became evident that psychoanalysis had unobtrusively
awakened some interest and gained some friends, that there
were even some scientific workers who were prepared to admit their
allegiance. A communication from Bleuler had already acquainted
me with the fact that my works were studied and applied in Burghölzli.<a id="r4"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
In January, 1907, the first man attached to the Zürich Clinic,
Dr. Eitingon, visited me at Vienna. Other visitors soon followed,
thus causing a lively exchange of ideas. Finally, by invitation of
C. G. Jung, then still an assistant physician at Burghölzli, the first
meeting took place at Salzburg, in the spring of 1908, where the
friends of psychoanalysis from Vienna, Zürich, and other places
met together. The result of this first psychoanalytic congress, was
the founding of a periodical, which began to appear in 1909, under
the name of “<span lang="de">Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische und Psychopathologische
<span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>Forschungen</span>,” published by Bleuler and Freud, and edited by
Jung. An intimate comradeship in the work done at Vienna and
Zürich found its expression in this publication.</p>

<p class="c005">I have repeatedly and gratefully acknowledged the efforts of the
Zürich Psychiatric School in the spreading of psychoanalysis, especially
those of Bleuler and Jung, and I do not hesitate to do the
same today, even under such changed circumstances. It was certainly
not the partisanship of the Zürich School which at that time
first directed the attention of the scientific world to the subject of
psychoanalysis. This latency period had just come to an end, and
psychoanalysis everywhere became the object of constantly increasing
interest. But whilst in all the other places this manifestation of
interest resulted first in nothing but a violent and emphatic repudiation
of the subject, in Zürich, on the contrary, the main feeling of
the situation was that of agreement. In no other place was so compact
a little gathering of adherents to be found, nowhere also was
it possible to place a public clinic at the service of psychoanalytic
investigation, or to find a clinical teacher who regarded the principles
of psychoanalysis as an integral part of the teaching of psychiatry.
The Zürich doctors became, as it were, the nucleus of the
little band which was fighting for the recognition of psychoanalysis.
Only in Zürich was there a possible opportunity to learn the new art
and to apply it in practice. Most of my present-day followers and
co-workers came to me via Zürich, even those who might have found,
geographically speaking, a shorter road to Vienna than to Switzerland.
Vienna lies in an eccentric position from western Europe,
which houses the great centers of our culture. For many years it
has been much affected by weighty prejudices. The representatives
of the most prominent nations stream into Switzerland, which is so
mentally active, and an infective lesion in this place was sure to become
very important for the dissemination of the “psychic epidemic,”
as Hoche of Freiburg called it.</p>

<p class="c005">According to the testimony of a colleague who was an eyewitness
of the developments at Burghölzli, it may be asserted that psychoanalysis
awakened an interest there very early. Already in Jung’s
<span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span>work on occult phenomena, published in 1902, there was an allusion
to dream interpretation. Ever since 1903 or 1904, according to my
informer, psychoanalysis came into prominence. After the establishment
of personal relations between Vienna and Zürich, a society was
also founded in Burghölzli in 1907 which discussed the problems of
psychoanalysis at regular meetings. In the bond that united the
Vienna and Zürich schools, the Swiss were by no means the merely
recipient part. They had themselves already performed respectable
scientific work, the results of which were of much use to psychoanalysis.
The association-experiment, started by the Wundt School,
had been interpreted by them in the psychoanalytic sense and had
proved itself of unexpected usefulness. Thus it had become possible
to get rapid experimental confirmation of psychoanalytic facts,
and to demonstrate experimentally to beginners certain relationships
which the analyst could only have talked about otherwise. The first
bridge leading from experimental psychology to psychoanalysis had
thus been constructed.</p>

<p class="c005">In psychoanalytic treatment, however, the association-experiment
enables one to make only a preliminary, qualitative analysis of the
case, it offers no essential contribution to the technique, and is really
not indispensable in the work of analysis. Of more importance,
however, was another discovery of the Zürich School, or rather, of
its two leaders, Bleuler and Jung. The former pointed out that a
great many purely psychiatric cases can be explained by the same
psychoanalytic process as those used in dreams and in the neuroses
(<span lang="de">Freudsche Mechanismen</span>). Jung employed with success the analytic
method of interpretation in the strangest and most obscure phenomena
of dementia præcox, the origin of which appeared quite
clear when correlated with the life and interests of the patient.
From that time on it became impossible for the psychiatrists to
ignore psychoanalysis. Bleuler’s great work on Schizophrenie
(1911), in which the psychoanalytic points of view are placed on an
equal footing with the clinical-systematic ones, brought this success
to completion.</p>

<p class="c005">I must not omit to point out a divergence which was then already
<span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>distinctly noticeable in the working tendencies of the two schools.
Already in 1897 I had published the analysis of a case of schizophrenia,
which showed, however, paranoid trends, so that its solution
could not have anticipated the impression of Jung’s analyses. But
to me the important element had not been the interpretation of the
symptoms, but rather the psychic mechanisms of the disease, and
above all, the agreement of this mechanism with the one already
known in hysteria. No light had been thrown at that time on the
difference between these two maladies. I was then already working
toward a theory of the libido in the neuroses which was to explain
all neurotic as well as psychotic appearances on the basis of abnormal
drifts of the libido. The Swiss investigators lacked this point
of view. So far as I know Bleuler, even today, adheres to an organic
causation for the forms of Dementia Præcox, and Jung,
whose book on this malady appeared in 1907, upheld the toxic theory
of the same at the Congress at Salzburg in 1908, which though not
excluding it, goes far beyond the libido theory. On this same point
he came to grief later (1912), in that he now used too much of the
stuff which previously he refused to employ at all.</p>

<p class="c005">A third contribution from the Swiss School, which is to be
ascribed probably entirely to Jung, I do not value as highly as do
others who are not in as close contact with it. I speak of the theory
of the <em>complexes</em>, which grew out of the “Diagnostische Assoziationsstudien”
(1906–1910). It itself has neither resulted in a psychological
theory nor has it added an unconstrained insertion to the
context of the psychoanalytic principles. On the other hand, the
word “complex” has gained for itself the right of citizenship in
psychoanalysis, as being a convenient and often an indispensable
term for descriptive summaries of psychologic facts. None other
among the names and designations, newly coined as a result of
psychoanalytic needs, has attained such widespread popularity; but
no other term has been so misapplied to the detriment of clear thinking.
In psychoanalytic diction one often spoke of the “return of
the complex” when “the return of the repression” was intended
to be conveyed, or one became accustomed to say “I have a complex
<span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>against him,” when more correctly he should have said “a
resistance.”</p>

<p class="c005">In the years after 1907, which followed the union of the schools
of Vienna and Zürich, psychoanalysis received that extraordinary
impetus in which it still finds itself today. This is positively attested
by the spread of psychoanalytic literature and the increase
in the number of doctors who desire to practice or learn it, also by
the mass of attacks upon it by congresses and learned societies.
It has wandered into the most distant countries, it everywhere
shocked psychiatrists, and has gained the attention of the cultured
laity and workers in other scientific fields. Havelock Ellis, who has
followed its development with sympathy without ever calling himself
its adherent, wrote, in 1911, in a paper for the Australasian
Medical Congress: “Freud’s psychoanalysis is now championed and
carried out not only in Austria and in Switzerland, but in the United
States, in England, India, Canada, and, I doubt not, in Australasia.”<a id="r5"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
A doctor from Chile (probably a German) appeared at the International
Congress in Buenos Ayres, in 1910, and spoke on behalf of
the existence of infantile sexuality and praised the results of psychoanalytic
therapy in obsessions.<a id="r6"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> An English neurologist in Central
India informed me through a distinguished colleague who came to
Europe, that the cases of Mohammedan Indians on whom he had
practiced analysis showed no other etiology of their neuroses than
our European patients.</p>

<p class="c005">The introduction of psychoanalysis into North America took
place under particularly glorious auspices. In the autumn of 1909,
Jung and myself were invited by President Stanley Hall, of Clark
University, to take part in the celebration of the twentieth anniversary
of the opening of Clark University, by giving some lectures
in German. We found, to our great astonishment, that the unprejudiced
men of that small but respected pedagogic-philosophical university
knew all the psychoanalytic writings and had honored them
<span class="pageno" id="Page_23">23</span>in their lectures to their students. Thus even in prudish America
one could, at least in academic circles, discuss freely and treat scientifically
all those things that are regarded as offensive in life. The
five lectures that I improvised at Worcester then appeared in English
in the American Journal of Psychology; later on they were
printed in German under the title, “Über Psychoanalyse.” Jung
lectured on diagnostic association studies and on “conflicts in the
psychic life of the child.” We were rewarded for it with the honorary
degree of LL.D. During this week of celebration at Worcester,
psychoanalysis was represented by five persons. Besides Jung
and myself there were Ferenczi, who had joined me as travelling-companion,
Ernest Jones, then of Toronto University (Canada),
now in London, and A. A. Brill, who was already practising psychoanalysis
in New York.</p>

<p class="c005">The most noteworthy personal relationship which resulted at Worcester,
was that established with James J. Putnam, teacher of neuropathology
at Harvard University. For years he had expressed a disparaging
opinion of psychoanalysis, but now he befriended it and recommended
it to his countrymen and his colleagues in numerous lectures,
rich in content and fine of form. The respect which he enjoys in
America, owing to his character, his high moral standard and his
keen love for truth, was very helpful to the cause of psychoanalysis
and protected it against the denunciations to which it might otherwise
have early succumbed. Yielding too much to the great ethical
and philosophic bent of his nature Putnam later required of psychoanalysis
what, to me, seems an impossible demand. He wished that
it should be pressed into the service of a certain moral philosophical
conception of the universe; but Putnam has remained the chief prop
of the psychoanalytic movement in his native land.</p>

<p class="c005">For the diffusion of this movement Brill and Jones deserve the
greatest credit. With a self-denying industry they constantly
brought under the notice of their countrymen, through their works,
the easily observable fundamental principles of psychoanalysis of
everyday life, of the dream and of the neuroses. Brill has strengthened
these influences by his medical activities and his translations of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_24">24</span>my writings: Jones, by illuminating lectures and clever discussions
at the American Congresses.<a id="r7"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The lack of a rooted scientific tradition
and the lesser rigidity of official authority have been of decided
advantage to the impetus given to psychoanalysis in America by
Stanley Hall. It was characteristic there from the beginning that
professors, heads of insane asylums, as well as independent practitioners,
all showed themselves equally interested in psychoanalysis.
But just for this very reason it is clear that the fight for
psychoanalysis must be fought to a decisive end, where the greater
resistance has been met with, namely, in the countries of the old cultural
centers.</p>

<p class="c005">Of the European countries, France has so far shown herself the
least receptive towards psychoanalysis, although creditable writings
by the Zürich physician, A. Maeder, have opened up for the French
reader an easy path to its principles. The first indications of interest
came from provincial France. Moricheau-Beauchant (Poitiers)
was the first Frenchman who openly accepted psychoanalysis.
Régis and Hesnard (Bordeaux) have lately tried (1913)
to overcome the prejudices of their countrymen by an exhaustive
and senseful presentation of the subject, which takes exception
only to symbolism. In Paris itself there still appears to reign
the conviction (given such oratorical expression at London Congress
1913 by Janet) that every thing good in psychoanalysis only repeats,
with slight modifications, the views of Janet—everything else in
psychoanalysis being bad. Janet himself had to stand at this Congress
a number of corrections from Ernest Jones, who was able to
reproach him for his lack of knowledge of the subject. We cannot,
however, forget the credit due Janet for his works on the psychology
of the neuroses, although we must repudiate his claims.</p>

<p class="c005">Italy, after many promising starts, ceased to take further interest.
Owing to personal connections psychoanalysis gained an early hearing
in Holland: Van Emden, Van Ophuijsen, Van Renterghem
<span class="pageno" id="Page_25">25</span>(“Freud en zijn school”) and the two doctors Stärke are busy in
Holland particularly on the theoretical side.<a id="r8"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> The interest in psychoanalysis
in scientific circles in England developed very slowly,
but the indications are that just here, favored by the English liking
for the practical and their passionate championship of justice, a
flourishing future awaits psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c005">In Sweden, P. Bjerre, successor to Wetterstand, has, at least
temporarily, given up hypnotic suggestion in favor of analytic treatment.
A. Vogt (Christiania) honored psychoanalysis already in
1907 in his “<span lang="da">Psykiatriens gruntraek</span>,” so that the first text-book on
psychiatry that took any notice of psychoanalysis was written in
Norwegian. In Russia, psychoanalysis is very generally known and
widespread; almost all my writings as well as those of other advocates
of analysis are translated into Russian. But a deeper grasp
of the analytic teaching has not yet shown itself in Russia. The
contributions written by Russian physicians and psychiatrists are not
at present noteworthy. Only Odessa possesses a trained psychoanalyst
in the person of M. Wulff. The introduction of psychoanalysis
into the science and literature of Poland is due chiefly to
the endeavors of L. Jekels. Hungary, geographically so near to
Austria, scientifically so foreign to it, has given to psychoanalysis
only one co-worker, S. Ferenczi, but such an one as is worth a
whole society.</p>

<p class="c005">The standing of psychoanalysis in Germany can be described in
no other way than to state that it is the cynosure of all scientific
discussion, and evokes from physicians as well as from the laity,
opinions of decided rejection, which, so far, have not come to an
end, but which, on the contrary, are constantly renewed and strengthened.
No official seat of learning has, so far, admitted psychoanalysis.
Successful practitioners who apply it are few. Only a few
institutions, such as that of Binswanger’s in Kreuzlingen (on Swiss
soil) and Marcinowski’s in Holstein, have opened their doors to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_26">26</span>psychoanalysis. In the critical city of Berlin, we have K. Abraham,
one of the most prominent representatives of psychoanalysis. He
was formerly an assistant of Bleuler. One might wonder that this
state of things has thus continued for a number of years without
any change, if it was not known that the above account merely describes
the superficial appearances. One must not overestimate the
significance of the rejection of psychoanalysis by the official representatives
of science, the heads of institutions, as well as their young
following. It is easy to understand why the opponents loudly raise
their voices whilst the followers, being intimidated, keep silent.
Many of the latter, whose first contributions to analysis raised high
expectations, later withdrew from the movement under the pressure
of circumstances. But the movement itself strides ahead
quietly. It is always gaining new supporters among psychiatrists
and the laity. It constantly increases the number of readers of
psychoanalytic literature and thus forces the opponents to a more
violent attempt at defense. In the course of these years I have
read, perhaps a dozen times, in the reports of the transactions of
certain congresses and of meetings of scientific societies, or in reviews
of certain publications, that psychoanalysis was now dead,
that it was finally overcome and settled. The answer to all this
would have to read like the telegram from Mark Twain to the newspaper
that falsely announced his death: “The report of my death is
grossly exaggerated.” After each of these death-notices, psychoanalysis
has gained new followers and co-workers and has created
for itself new organs. Surely to be reported dead is an advance
over being treated with dead silence!</p>

<p class="c005">Hand in hand with its territorial expansion just described psychoanalysis
became enlarged with regard to its contents through its encroaching
upon fields of knowledge outside of the study of the
neuroses and psychiatry. I will not treat in detail the development
of this part of our branch of science since this was excellently done
by Rank and Sachs (in Löwenfeld’s “Grenzfragen”)<a id="r9"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> which presents
<span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>exhaustively just these achievements in the work of analysis.
Besides, here everything is in inchoate form, hardly worked out,
mostly only preliminary and sometimes only in the stage of an intention.
Every honest thinker will find herein no grounds for reproach.
There is a tremendous amount of problems for a small
number of workers whose chief activity lies elsewhere, who are
obliged to attack the special problems of the new science with only
amateurish preparation. These workers hailing from the psychoanalytic
field make no secret of their dilettantism, they only desire
to be guides and temporary occupants of the places of those specialists
to whom they recommend the analytic technique and principles
until the latter are ready to take up this work themselves. That the
results aimed at are, even now, not at all insignificant, is due partly
to the fruitfulness of the psychoanalytic method, and partly to the
circumstance that already there are a few investigators, who, without
being physicians, have made the application of psychoanalysis
to the mental sciences their lifework.</p>

<p class="c005">Most of these psychoanalytic applications can be traced, as is
easily understood, to the impetus given by my early analytic works.
The analytic examinations of nervous patients and neurotic manifestations
of normal persons drove me to the assumption of psychological
relationships which, most certainly, could not be limited only to
that field. Thus analysis presented us not only with the explanation
of pathological occurrences, but also showed us their connection
with normal psychic life and uncovered undreamed-of relations between
psychiatry and a variety of other sciences dealing with activities
of mind. Thus certain typical dreams furnished the understanding
of many myths and fairy tales. Riklin and Abraham followed
this hint and began those investigations about myths which have
found their completion in the works of Rank on Mythology, works
which do full justice to all the requirements of the specialist. The
prosecution of dream-symbology led to the very heart of the problems
of mythology, folk-lore (Jones, Storfer) and of religious abstraction.
At one of the psychoanalytic congresses the audience was
deeply impressed when a student of Jung pointed out the similarity
<span class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span>of the phantasy-formation of schizophrenics with the cosmogonies
of primitive times and peoples. In a later elaboration, no longer
free from objection yet very interesting, Jung made use of mythological
material in an attempt to harmonize the neurotic with religious
and mythological phantasies.</p>

<p class="c005">Another path led from the investigation of dreams to the analysis
of poetic creations, and finally to the analysis of authors
and artists themselves. Very soon it was discovered that the
dreams invented by writers stand in the same relation to analysis
as do genuine dreams.<a id="r10"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> The conception of the unconscious
psychic activity enabled us to get the first glimpse into the nature of
the poetic creativeness. The valuation of the emotional feelings
which we were forced to recognize while studying the neuroses enabled
us to recognize the sources of artistic productions and brought
up the problem as to how the artist reacts to those stimuli and with
what means he disguises his reactions.<a id="r11"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Most psychoanalysts with
wide interests have furnished contributions from their works for the
treatment of these problems, which are among the most attractive
in the application of psychoanalysis. Naturally here also opposition
was not lacking from those who are not acquainted with analysis,
and expressed itself with the same lack of understanding and
passionate rejection as on the native soil of psychoanalysis. For it
was to be expected as a matter of course, that everywhere psychoanalysis
penetrates, it would have to go through the same struggle
with the natives. However, these attempted invasions have not yet
stirred up interest in all fields which will, in the future, be open to
them. Among the strictly scientific applications of analysis to literature
the deep work of Rank on the theme of incest easily ranks
first. Its content is certain to evoke the greatest unpopularity.
Philological and historical works on the basis of psychoanalysis are
few, at present. I myself dared to venture to make the first attempt
<span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>into the problems of the psychology of religion in 1910, when
I compared religious ceremonials with neurotic ceremonials. In his
work on the “piety of the Count of Zinzendorf,” as well as in other
contributions, the Rev. Dr. Pfister, of Zürich, has succeeded in tracing
back religious zealotism to perverse eroticism. In the recent
works of the Zürich School one is more likely to find that religion
becomes injected into the analysis rather than rationally explained
by it.</p>

<p class="c005">In my four essays on “Totem and Taboo”<a id="r12"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> I made the attempt
to discuss the problems of race psychology by means of analysis.
This should lead us directly to the origins of the most important
institutions of our civilization, such as state regulations, morality,
religion, as well as to the origins of the interdiction of incest and of
conscience. To what extent the relations thus obtained will be proof
to criticism cannot be determined today.</p>

<p class="c005">My book on Wit<a id="r13"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> furnished the first examples of the application
of analytic thinking to esthetic themes. Everything else is still
waiting for workers, who can expect a rich harvest in this very field.
We are lacking here in workers from these respective specialties
and in order to attract such, Hanns Sachs founded in 1912, the journal
Imago, edited by himself and Rank. Hitschmann and v. Winterstein
made a beginning with the psychoanalytic elucidation of philosophical
systems and personalities. The continuation and deeper
treatment of the same is much to be desired.</p>

<p class="c005">The revolutionary findings of psychoanalysis concerning the
psychic life of the child, the part played therein by sexual impulses
(v. Hug-Helmuth) and the fate of such participation of sexuality
which becomes useless for the purpose of propagation, naturally
drew attention to pedagogics, and instigated the effort to push the
analytical viewpoint into the foreground of this sphere. Recognition
is due to the Rev. Pfister for having begun this application of
analysis with honest enthusiasm, and for having brought it to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>notice of ministers and educators.<a id="r14"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> He succeeded in winning over
a number of Swiss pedagogues as sympathizers in this work. It is
said that some preferred to remain circumspectly in the background.
A portion of the Vienna analysts seem to have landed in their retreat
from psychoanalysis on a sort of medical pedagogy. (Adler and
Furtmüller, “Heilen and Bilden,” 1913.)</p>

<p class="c005">I have attempted in these incomplete suggestions to indicate the,
as yet, hardly visible wealth of associations which have sprung up
between medical psychoanalysis and other fields of science. There
is material for the work of a whole generation of investigators and
I doubt not that this work will be done when once the resistance to
psychoanalysis as such has been overcome.<a id="r15"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c005">To write the history of the resistances, I consider, at present,
both fruitless and inopportune. It would not be very glorious for
the scientific men of our day. But I will add at once that it has
never occurred to me to rail against the opponents of psychoanalysis
merely because they were opponents, not counting a few unworthy
individuals, fortune hunters and plunderers such as in time of war
are always found on both sides. For I knew how to account for
the behavior of these opponents and had besides discovered that
psychoanalysis brings to light the worst in every man. But I decided
not to answer my opponents and, so far as I had influence, to keep
others from polemics. The value of public or literary discussions
seemed to me very doubtful under the particular conditions in which
the fight over psychoanalysis took place. The value of majorities
at congresses or society meetings was certainly doubtful, and my
confidence in the honesty and distinction of my opponents was always
slight. Observation shows that only very few persons are
capable of remaining polite, not to speak of objective, in any scientific
dispute, and the impression gained from a scientific quarrel was
always a horror to me. Perhaps this attitude of mine has been misunderstood,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>perhaps I have been considered as good-natured or so intimidated
that it was supposed no further consideration need be
shown me.</p>

<p class="c005">This is a mistake. I can revile and rave as well as any other,
but I am not able to render into literary form the expressions of
the underlying affects and therefore I prefer to abstain entirely.</p>

<p class="c005">Perhaps in many respects it might have been better had I permitted
free vent to my own passions and to those about me. We
have all heard the interesting attempt at an explanation of the
origin of psychoanalysis from its Viennese milieu. Janet did not
scorn to make use of it as late as 1913, although, no doubt, he is
proud of being a Parisian. This <em>aperçu</em> says that psychoanalysis,
especially the assertion that the neuroses can be traced back to disturbances
in the sexual life, could only have originated in a city like
Vienna, in an atmosphere of sensuality and immorality not to be
found in other cities, and that it thus represents only a reflection, the
theoretical projection as it were, of these particular Viennese conditions.
Well, I certainly am no local patriot, but this theory has
always seemed to be especially nonsensical, so nonsensical that sometimes
I was inclined to assume that the reproaching of the Vienna
spirit was only a euphemistic substitution for another one which
one did not care to bring up publicly. If the assumptions had been
of the opposite kind, we might be inclined to listen. But even if
we assume that there might be a city whose inhabitants have imposed
upon themselves special sexual restrictions and at the same
time show a peculiar tendency to severe neurotic maladies, then such
a town might well furnish the soil on which some observer might
get the idea of connecting these two facts and of deducting the one
from the other. But neither assumption fits Vienna. The Viennese
are neither more abstemious nor yet more nervous than dwellers
in any other metropolis. Sex matters are a little freer, prudishness
is less than in the cities of western and northern Europe that are so
proud of their chastity. Our supposed observer would, more likely,
be led astray by the particular conditions prevailing in Vienna than
be enlightened as to the cause of the neuroses.</p>

<p class="c005"><span class="pageno" id="Page_32">32</span>But Vienna has done everything possible to deny her share in
the origin of psychoanalysis. Nowhere else is the inimical indifference
of the learned and cultured circles so clearly evident to the
psychoanalyst.</p>

<p class="c005">Perhaps I am somewhat to blame for this by my policy of avoiding
widespread publicity. If I had caused psychoanalysis to occupy
the medical societies of Vienna with noisy sessions, with an unloading
of all passions, wherein all reproaches and invectives carried on
the tongue or in the mind would have been expressed, then perhaps
the ban against psychoanalysis might, by now, have been removed
and its standing no longer might have been that of a stranger in its
native city. As it is, the poet may be right when he makes Wallenstein
say:</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c010">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Yet this the Viennese will not forgive me,</div>
      <div class="line">That I did them out of a spectacle.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c005">The task to which I am unequal, namely, that of reproaching the
opponents “<span lang="la">suaviter in modo</span>” for their injustice and arbitrariness,
was taken up by Bleuler in 1911 and carried out in most honorable
fashion in his work, “Freud’s Psychoanalysis: a Defense and a
Criticism.” It would be so entirely natural for me to praise this
work, critical in two directions, that I hasten to tell what there is in
it I object to. This work appears to me to be still very partisan,
too lenient to the mistakes of our opponents, and altogether too
severe to the shortcomings of our followers. This characterization
of it may explain why the opinion of a psychiatrist of such high
standing, of such indubitable ability and independence, has not had
greater influence on his colleagues. The author of “Affectivity”
(1906) must not be surprised if the influence of a work is not determined
by the value of its argument but by the tone of its affect.
Another part of this influence—the one on the followers of psychoanalysis—Bleuler
himself destroyed later on by bringing into prominence
in 1913, in his “Criticism of the Freudian School,” the obverse
side of his attitude to psychoanalysis. Therein he takes away
so much from the structure of the psychoanalytic principles that
our opponents may well be satisfied with the assistance of this defender.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>It was not new arguments or better observations that served
Bleuler as a guidance for these verdicts, but only the reference to
his own knowledge, the inadequacy of which the author no longer
admits as in his earlier writings. Here an almost irreparable loss
seemed to threaten psychoanalysis. However, in his last utterance
(“Die Kritiken der Schizophrenie,” 1914) on the occasion of the
attacks made upon him owing to his introduction of psychoanalysis
into his book on “Schizophrenie,” Bleuler rises to what he himself
terms a “haughty presumption:” “But now I will assume a haughty
presumption, I consider that the many psychologies to date have
contributed mighty little to the explanation of the connection between
psychogenetic symptoms and diseases, but that the deeper
psychology (<span lang="de">tiefen psychologie</span>) furnishes us a part of the psychology
still to be created, which the physician needs in order to understand
his patients and to heal them rationally; and I even believe
that in my ‘Schizophrenie’ I have taken a very small step towards
this.” The first two assertions are surely correct, the latter may be
an error.</p>

<p class="c005">Since by the “deeper psychology” psychoanalysis alone is to be
understood, we may, for the present, remain satisfied with this admission.</p>

<p class="c004">Two years after the first congress the second private congress
of psychoanalysts took place at Nuremberg, March, 1910. During
the interval, whilst I was still under the impression of the favorable
reception in America, the growing hostility in Germany and the unexpected
support through the acquisition of the Zürich School, I
had conceived a project which I was able to carry out, at this second
congress, with the help of my friend S. Ferenczi. I had in mind to
organize the psychoanalytic movement, to transfer its center to
Zürich, and place it under a head who would take care of its future.
As this found much opposition among the adherents of psychoanalysis,
I will explain my motives more fully. Thus I hope to justify
myself, even if it turns out that my action was not a very wise one.</p>

<p class="c005">I judged that the association with Vienna was no recommendation,
but rather an obstacle for the new movement. A place like
Zürich, in the heart of Europe, where an academic teacher had
opened his institution to psychoanalysis, seemed to me much more
promising. Moreover, I assumed that my own person was a second
obstacle. The estimate put upon my personality was utterly confused
by the favor or dislike from different factions. I was either
compared to Darwin and Kepler or reviled as a paralytic. I, therefore,
desired to push into the background not only the city whence
psychoanalysis emanated, but also my own personality. Furthermore,
I was no longer young, I saw a long road before me and I
felt oppressed by the idea that it had fallen to my lot to become a
leader in my advanced age. Yet I felt that there must be a leader.
I knew only too well what mistakes lay in wait for him who would
undertake the practice of psychoanalysis, and hoped that many of
these might be avoided if we had an authority who was prepared to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>guide and admonish. Such authority naturally devolved upon me
in view of the indisputable advantage of fifteen years’ experience.
It was now my desire to transfer this authority to a younger man
who would, quite naturally, take my place on my death. I felt that
this person could be only C. G. Jung, for Bleuler was of my own
age. In favor of Jung was his conspicuous talents, the contributions
he had already made to analysis, his independent position, and the
impression of energy which his personality always made. He also
seemed prepared to enter into friendly relations with me, and to
give up, for my sake, certain race-prejudices which he had so far
permitted himself to indulge. I had no notion then that in spite
of the advantages enumerated, this was a very unfortunate choice;
that it concerned a person who, incapable of tolerating the authority
of another, was still less fitted to be himself an authority, one
whose energy was devoted to the unscrupulous pursuit of his own
interests.</p>

<p class="c005">The formation of an official organization I considered necessary
because I feared the abuses to which psychoanalysis would be subjected,
once it should achieve popularity. I felt that there should
be a place that could give the dictum: “With all this nonsense,
analysis has nothing to do; this is not psychoanalysis.” It was decided
that at the meeting of the local groups which together formed
the international organization, instruction should be given how psychoanalysis
should be practised, that physicians should be trained
there and that the local society should, in a way, stand sponsor for
them. It also appeared to me desirable that the adherents of psychoanalysis
should meet for friendly intercourse and mutual support,
inasmuch as official science had pronounced its great ban and
boycott against physicians and institutions practising psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c005">This and nothing else I wished to attain by the founding of the
“International Psychoanalytic Association.” Perhaps it was more
than could possibly be attained. Just as my opponents learned that
it was not possible to stem the new movement, so I had to learn, by
experience, that it would not permit itself to be led along the particular
path which I had laid out for it. The motion made by
<span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>Ferenczi at Nuremberg was seconded. Jung was elected president,
and Riklin was chosen as secretary. It was also decided to publish
a corresponding journal through which the central association was
“to foster and further the science of psychoanalysis as founded by
Freud both as pure psychology, as well as in its application to
medicine and the mental sciences, and to promote assistance among
the members in all their efforts to acquire and to spread psychoanalytic
knowledge.” The members of the Vienna group alone firmly opposed
the project with passionate excitement. Adler expressed his
fear that “a censorship and limitation of scientific freedom” was
intended. The Viennese finally gave in, after having gained their
point that Zürich should not be raised to the center of the association,
but that the center should be the home city of the president,
who was to be elected for two years.</p>

<p class="c005">At this congress three local groups were constituted: one in
Berlin under the chairmanship of Abraham, one in Zürich, whose
chairman became the president of the central association, and one in
Vienna, the chairmanship of which I relinquished to Adler. A
fourth group, in Budapest, could not be formed until later. On account
of illness Bleuler had been absent from the congress. Later
he evinced considerable hesitation about entering the association and
although he let himself be persuaded to do so by my personal representations,
he resigned a short time afterwards owing to disagreements
at Zürich. This severed the connection between the Zürich
group and the Burghölzli institution.</p>

<p class="c005">Another result of the Nuremberg Congress was the founding of the
Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse, which caused a reconciliation between
Adler and Stekel. It had originally been intended as an opposing
tendency and was to win back for Vienna the hegemony
threatened by the election of Jung. But when the two founders of
the journal, under pressure of the difficulty of finding a publisher,
assured me of their friendly intentions and as guarantee of their
attitude gave me the right to veto, I accepted the editorship and
worked vigorously for this new organ, the first number of which appeared
in September, 1910.</p>

<p class="c005"><span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>I will not continue the history of the Psychoanalytic Congress.
The third one took place at Weimar, September, 1911, and even surpassed
the previous ones in spirit and scientific interest. J. J. Putnam,
who was present at this meeting, later expressed in America
his satisfaction and his respect for the “mental attitude” of those
present and quoted words which I was supposed to have used in
reference to the latter: “They have learned to endure a bit of truth.”
As a matter of fact any one who has attended scientific congresses
must have received a lasting impression in favor of the Psychoanalytic
Association. I myself had presided over two former congresses.
I thought it best to give every lecturer ample time for his
paper and left the discussions of these lectures to take place later
as a sort of private exchange of ideas. Jung, who presided over the
Weimar meeting, reëstablished the discussions after each lecture,
which had not, however, proved disturbing at that time.</p>

<p class="c005">Two years later, in September, 1913, quite another picture was
presented by the congress at Münich which is still vividly recalled
by those who were present. It was presided over by Jung in an unamiable
and incorrect fashion: the lecturers were limited as to
time, and the discussion dwarfed the lectures. Through a malicious
mood of chance the evil genius of Hoche had taken up his residence
in the same house in which the analysts held their meetings.
Hoche could easily have convinced himself that his characterization
of these psychoanalysts, as a sect, blindly and meekly following their
leader, was true <em>ad absurdum</em>. The fatiguing and unedifying proceedings
ended in the reëlection of Jung as president of the International
Psychoanalytic Association, which fact Jung accepted, although
two fifths of those present refused him their support. We
took leave from one another without feeling the need to meet again!</p>

<p class="c005">About the time of this third Congress the condition of the International
Psychoanalytic Association was as follows: The local groups
at Vienna, Berlin, and Zürich had constituted themselves already at
the congress at Nuremberg in 1910. In May, 1911, a group, under the
chairmanship of Dr. L. Seif, was added at Münich. In the same
year the first American local group was formed under the chairmanship
<span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>of A. A. Brill under the name of “The New York Psychoanalytic
Society.” At the Weimar Congress, the founding of a
second American group was authorized. This came into existence
during the next year as “The American Psychoanalytic Association.”
It included members from Canada and all America; Putnam
was elected president, and Ernest Jones was made secretary.
Just before the congress at Münich in 1913, a local group was
founded at Budapest under the leadership of S. Ferenczi. Soon
afterwards Jones, who settled in London, founded the first English
group. The number of members of the eight groups then in existence
could not, of course, furnish any standard for the computation
of the non-organized students and adherents of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c005">The development of the periodical literature of psychoanalysis
is also worthy of a brief mention. The first periodical publications
serving the interests of analysis were the <span lang="de">Schriften zur angewandten
Seelenkunden</span> which have appeared irregularly since 1907 and have
reached the fifteenth volume.<a id="r16"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> They published writings by Freud,
Riklin, Jung, Abraham, Rank, Sadger, Pfister, M. Graf, Jones, Storfer
and Hug-Hellmuth. The founding of the Imago, to be mentioned
later, has somewhat lowered the value of this form of publication. After
the meeting at Salzburg, 1908, the Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische
und psychopathologische Forschungen was founded, which appeared
under Jung’s editorship for five years, and it has now reappeared
under new editorship and under the slightly changed title of Jahrbuch
der Psychoanalyse. It no longer wishes to be as in former
years, merely an archive for collecting works of psychoanalytic
merit, but it wishes to justify its editorial task by taking due notice
of all occurrences and all endeavors in the field of psychoanalysis.
As mentioned before Das Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse started by
Adler and Stekel after the founding of the “International Association”
(Nuremberg, 1910) went through in a short time a very varied
career. Already in the tenth issue of the first volume there was an
announcement that in view of scientific difference of opinion with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_39">39</span>the editors, Dr. Adler had decided voluntarily to withdraw his collaboration.
This placed the entire editorship in the hands of Dr.
Stekel (summer of 1911). At the Weimar congress the Zentralblatt
was raised to the official organ of the “International Association”
and by raising the annual dues it was made accessible to all
members. Beginning with the third number of the second year
(winter 1912) Stekel alone became responsible for the contents of
the journal. His behavior, which is difficult to explain in public,
forced me to sever all my connections with this journal and to give
psychoanalysis in all haste a new organ, the International Journal
for Medical Psychoanalysis (Internationale Zeitschrift für Ärztliche
Psychoanalyse). With the help of almost all my collaborators
and the new publisher, H. Heller, the first number of this new journal
was able to appear in January, 1913, to take the place of the
Zentralblatt as the official organ of the “International Psychoanalytic
Association.”</p>

<p class="c005">Meanwhile Dr. Hanns Sachs and Dr. Otto Rank founded early
in 1912 a new journal, Imago (published by Heller), whose only aim
is the application of psychoanalysis to mental sciences. Imago has
now reached the middle of its third year, and enjoys the increasing
interest of readers who are not medically interested in psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c005">Apart from these four periodical publications (Schriften z. Angew.
Seelenkunde, Jahrbuch, Intern. Zeitschrift, and Imago) other
German and foreign journals have contributed works that can claim
a place in psychoanalytic literature. The Journal of Abnormal
Psychology, published by Morton Prince, as a rule, contains many
good analytical contributions. In the winter of 1913 Dr. White and
Dr. Jelliffe started a journal exclusively devoted to psychoanalysis,
<span class="sc">The Psychoanalytic Review</span>, which takes into account the fact
that most physicians in America interested in psychoanalysis do not
master the German language.</p>

<p class="c005">I am now obliged to speak of two secessions which have taken
place among the followers of psychoanalysis. The first of these
took place in the interval between the founding of the association
<span class="pageno" id="Page_40">40</span>in 1910 and the congress at Weimar, 1911, the second took place
after this, and came to light in Münich in 1913. The disappointment
which they caused me might have been avoided if more attention
had been paid to the mechanisms of those who undergo analytical
treatment. I was well aware that any one might take flight on
first approach to the unlovely truths of analysis; I myself had always
asserted that any one’s understanding may be suspended by one’s
own repressions (through the resistances which sustain them) so
that in his relation to psychoanalysis he cannot get beyond a certain
point. But I had not expected that any one who had mastered analysis
to a certain depth could renounce this understanding and lose
it. And yet daily experience with patients had shown that the total
rejection of all knowledge gained through analysis may be brought
about by any deeper stratum of particularly strong resistance.
Even if we succeed through laborious work in causing such a patient
to grasp parts of analytic knowledge and handle these as his own
possessions, it may well happen that under the domination of the
next resistance he will throw to the winds all he has learned and
will defend himself as in his first days of treatment. I had to learn
that this can happen among psychoanalysts just as among patients
during treatment.</p>

<p class="c005">It is no enviable task to write the history of these two secessions,
partly because I am not impelled to it by strong personal motives—I
had not expected gratitude nor am I to any active degree revengeful—and
partly because I know that I hereby lay myself open to the
invectives of opponents manifesting but little consideration, and at
the same time I regale the enemies of psychoanalysis with the long
wished-for spectacle of seeing the psychoanalysts tearing each other
to pieces. I had to exercise much control to keep myself from fighting
with the opponents of psychoanalysis, and now I feel constrained
to take up the fight with former followers or such as still wish to
be called so. I have no choice; to keep silent would be comfortable
or cowardly, but it would hurt the subject more than the frank uncovering
of the existing evils. Any one who has followed the
growth of scientific movements will know that quite similar disturbances
<span class="pageno" id="Page_41">41</span>and dissensions took place in all of them. It may be that
elsewhere they are more carefully concealed. However, psychoanalysis,
which denies many conventional ideals, is also more honest
in these things.</p>

<p class="c005">Another very palpable inconvenience lies in the fact that I cannot
altogether avoid going into an analytic elucidation. Analysis
is not, however, suitable for polemical use; it always presupposes
the consent of the one analyzed and the situation of a superior and
subordinate. Therefore he who wishes to use analysis with polemic
intent must offer no objection if the person so analyzed will, in his
turn, use analysis against him, and if the discussion merges into a
state in which the awakening of a conviction in an impartial third
party is entirely excluded. I shall, therefore, make here the smallest
possible use of analysis, thereby limiting my indiscretion and aggression
against my opponents, and I will also add that I base no scientific
criticism on this means. I have nothing to do with the possible
substance of truths in the theories to be rejected nor am I seeking
to refute the same. This task may be left to other able workers
in the field of psychoanalysis, and some of it has already been done.
I only desire to show that these theories deny the basic principles
of analysis—I will show in what points—and for this reason should
not be known under this name. I shall, therefore, use analysis only
to make clear, how these deviations from analysis could take place
among analysts. At the parting places I am, of course, obliged to
defend the just rights of psychoanalysis with purely critical remarks.</p>

<p class="c005">Psychoanalysis has found as its first task the explanation of the
neuroses; it has taken the two facts of resistance and transference
as starting points, and by bearing in mind the third fact of amnesia
in the theories of repression, it has given justification to the sexual
motive forces of the neuroses and of the unconscious. Psychoanalysis
has never claimed to give a perfect theory of the human
psychic life, but has only demanded that its discoveries should be
used for the completion and correction of knowledge we have gained
elsewhere. But Alfred Adler’s theory goes far beyond this goal.
It pretends to explain with one stroke the behavior and character
<span class="pageno" id="Page_42">42</span>of men as well as their neurotic and psychotic maladies. As a
matter of fact, Adler’s theory is more adequate to any other field
than to that of the neuroses, which he still puts in the first place
because of the history of its origin. I had the opportunity of
studying Dr. Adler many years and have never denied him the testimonial
of having a superior mind, especially endowed speculatively.
As proof of the “persecution” which he claims to have suffered at
my hands, I can only say that after the formation of the Association
I handed over to him the leadership of the Vienna group. It
was only after urgent requests from all the members of the society
that I could be prevailed upon to resume the presidency at the scientific
proceedings. When I had recognized Dr. Adler’s slight talent
for the estimation of the unconscious material, I expected that he
would know how to discover the connections between psychoanalysis
and psychology and the biological bases of the impulses, a discovery
to which he was entitled, in a certain sense, through his valuable
studies about the inferiority of organs. He really did bring
out some thing, but his work makes the impression as if—to speak
in his own jargon—it were intended to prove that psychoanalysis
was wrong in everything and that the significance of the sexual impelling
forces could only be due to gullibility about the assertions
of neurotics. Of the personal motive of his work I may also
speak publicly, since he himself revealed it in the presence of a
small circle of members of the Vienna group. “Do you believe,”
he remarked, “that it is such a great pleasure for me to stand in
your shadow my whole life?” To be sure I see nothing objectionable
in the fact that a younger man should frankly admit an ambition
which one might, in any case, suspect as one of the incentives
of his work. But even under the domination of such a motive a
man should know how to avoid being “unfair” as designated by
the English with their fine social tact. We Germans have only a
much coarser word at our disposal to convey this idea. How little
Adler has succeeded in not being unfair is shown by the great number
of mean outbursts of anger which distort his writings, and by
the feeling of an ungovernable mania for priority which pervades
<span class="pageno" id="Page_43">43</span>his work. At the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society we once heard him
claim for himself the priority for the viewpoints of the “unity of
the neuroses” and the “dynamic conception” of the same. This
was a great surprise for me as I had always believed that I had represented
these two principles before I had ever known Adler.<a id="r17"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c005">This striving of Adler for a place in the sun has brought about,
however, one result, which must be considered beneficial to psychoanalysis.
When I was obliged to bring about Adler’s resignation
from the editorial staff of the Zentralblatt, after the appearance of
his irreconcilable scientific antagonisms, Adler also left the Vienna
group and founded a new society to which he first gave the tasteful
name “Society for Free Psychoanalysis.” But the outside public,
unacquainted with analysis, is evidently as little skilled in recognizing
the difference between the views of two psychoanalysts, as are
Europeans in recognizing the tints between two Chinese faces. The
“free” psychoanalysis remained in the shadow of the “official”
and “orthodox” one, and was treated only as an appendage of the
latter. Then Adler took the step for which we are thankful. He
severed all connection with psychoanalysis and named his teachings
“The Individual Psychology.” There is much space on God’s earth,
and any one who can is surely justified in tumbling about upon it
uninhibited; but it is not desirable to continue living under one roof
when people no longer understand one another and no longer get on
together. Adler’s “Individual Psychology” is now one of the many
psychological movements opposed to psychoanalysis, and its further
development lies outside our interests.</p>

<p class="c005">Adler’s theory was, from the very beginning, a “system,” which
psychoanalysis was careful not to become. It is also an excellent
example of a “secondary elaboration” as seen, for example, in the
process which the waking thought produces in dream material.<a id="r18"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
In this case instead of dream material there is the material newly
<span class="pageno" id="Page_44">44</span>acquired from the viewpoint of the ego and brought under the
familiar categories of the same. It is then translated, changed, and
as thoroughly misunderstood as happens in the case of dream-formation.
Adler’s theory is thus characterized less by what it asserts
than by what it denies. It consequently consists of three elements
of quite dissimilar value; first, good contributions to the psychology
of the ego, which are superfluous but admissible; secondly, translations
of analytical facts into the new jargon, and, thirdly, distortions
and perversions of these facts when they do not fit into the ego
presuppositions. The elements of the first kind have never been
ignored by psychoanalysis, although it owed no special attention to
them. Psychoanalysis had a greater interest in showing that all
ego strivings are mixed with libidinous components. Adler’s theory
emphasizes the counterpart to it; namely, that all libidinous feeling
contains an admixture of egotism. This would have been a palpable
gain if Adler had not made use of this assertion to deny, every time,
the libidinous feelings in favor of the impelling ego components.
His theory thus does exactly what all patients do, and what our
conscious thinking always does, it rationalizes, as Jones would say,
in order to conceal the unconscious motives. Adler is so consistent
in this, that he considers the object of evincing domination over the
woman, to be on the top, as the mainspring of the sexual act. I do
not know if he has upheld this monstrous idea in his writings.</p>

<p class="c005">Psychoanalysis early recognized that every neurotic symptom
owes the possibility of its existence to some compromise. It must,
therefore, also put to some good account the demands of the ego
which manages the repression, it must offer it some advantages by
finding for it some useful employment, otherwise it would suffer the
same fate as the originally defended impulses. The term “morbid
gain” expresses this state of affairs. One might even have been
justified in differentiating the primary gain for the ego which must
have been active at the origin, from a “secondary” gain which appears
in connection with other intentions of the ego, when the symptom
is about to assert itself. It has also long been known to analysis
that the withdrawal of this morbid gain, or the cessation of the same
<span class="pageno" id="Page_45">45</span>in consequence of some real change, is one of the mechanisms in the
cure of the symptom. On these relationships which can be verified
and understood without difficulty, Adler’s theory puts the greatest
emphasis. It entirely overlooks the fact that innumerable times the
ego makes a virtue out of necessity in submitting to the most undesired
symptom forced upon it, because of the use it can make of it,
<em>e. g.</em>, when the ego accepts anxiety as a means of security. Here the
ego plays the absurd part of the Pierot in the circus, who, through
his gestures, wishes to convey to the spectators the impression that
all changes in the menage are taking place at his command. But
only the youngest among the spectators believe him.</p>

<p class="c005">For the second part of Adler’s theory psychoanalysis must stand
security as for its own possessions. For it is nothing but psychoanalytic
knowledge which the author had from all the sources opened
to him during ten years of our joint work, but which he later
marked as his own after changing the nomenclature. For instance,
I myself consider “security” a better word than “protective
measure,” which I used; but cannot find in it any new meaning.
Similarly one will find in Adler’s statements a great many long-known
features if one will replace the expressions “feigned”
(fingiert) fictive and fiction, by the original words “to fancy” and
“phantasy.” This identity would be emphasized by psychoanalysis,
even if the author had not for many years participated in our
common work.</p>

<p class="c005">The third part of Adler’s theory, which consists in giving new
interpretations to, and in distorting the disagreeable facts of psychoanalysis,
contains that which definitely severs the actual “Individual
Psychology” from psychoanalysis. As is known the principle of
Adler’s system states that it is the object of the self-assertion of the
individual, his “will to power” in the form of the “masculine protest,”
to manifest itself domineeringly in the conduct of life, in character
formation and in the neurosis. This “masculine protest,” the
Adlerism motor, is nothing else, however, than the repression set free
from its psychological mechanism, and what is more, it is sexualized
and thus hardly in keeping with the vaunted expulsion of sexuality
<span class="pageno" id="Page_46">46</span>from its place in the psychic life. The “masculine protest” certainly
exists, but in constituting it as the motor of the psychic life, observation
has only played the part of the springboard which one leaves in
order to uplift one’s self. Let us consider one of the most fundamental
situations of the infantile desire; namely, the observation of
the sexual act between adults by the child. When the life-history of
such persons is later subjected to analysis by a physician, it is found
that at this moment the minor spectator was seized by two feelings;
one, in the case of a boy, to put himself in the place of the active
man, and the other, the opposing feeling, to identify himself with the
suffering woman. Both strivings conjointly exhaust the pleasure
that might have resulted from this situation. Only the first feeling
can come under the head of the “masculine protest” if this idea is
to retain any meaning at all. The second feeling, whose fate Adler
either ignores or does not know, is really the one which assumes
greater significance in the later neurosis. Adler has placed himself
so entirely into the jealous confinement of the ego, that he only
accounts for such emotional feelings as are agreeable to the ego and
furthered by it; but the case of the neurosis, which opposes these
strivings, lies beyond his horizon.</p>

<p class="c005">Adler’s most serious deviations from the reality of observation
and his deepest confusion of ideas have arisen in his attempt to
correlate the basic principle of his theory with the psychic life of the
child, an attempt which has become inevitable in psychoanalysis.
The biological, social, and physiological meaning of “masculine”
and “feminine” have here become mixed into a hopeless composition.
It is quite impossible, and it can easily be disproved by observation,
that the masculine or feminine child builds its plan of life
on any original undervaluation of the feminine sex; nor is it conceivable
that a child can take as the guiding line the wish: “I will
be a real man.” In the beginning no child has even an inkling of
the significance of the difference in sex, more likely it starts with
the assumption that both sexes possess the same (male) genital.
It does not begin its sexual investigation with the problem of sex
differentiation and is far from entertaining the social undervaluation
<span class="pageno" id="Page_47">47</span>of the woman. There are women in whose neurosis the wish to be
a man never played any part. So far as the “masculine protest” is
concerned, it can easily be traced back to a disturbance of the
original narcissism caused by the threat of castration; that is, to
the first hindrance of sexual activity. All dispute as to the psychogenesis
of the neuroses must ultimately be decided in the sphere of
the childhood neuroses. The careful analysis of a neurosis of the
early years of childhood puts an end to all mistakes in regard to the
etiology of the neuroses, and all doubts as to the part played by the
sexual impulses. That is why Adler in his criticism of Jung’s “Conflicts
of the Child’s Mind” was obliged to resort to the imputation
that the material of the case surely must have followed a uniform
new tendency “from the father.”<a id="r19"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c005">I will not linger any longer over the biological side of Adler’s
theory, and will not examine whether the palpable inferiority of
organs or the subjective feeling of the same (one often cannot tell
which) can possibly be the basis of Adler’s system. Only permit
me to remark that this would make the neurosis a by-product of the
general stunting, while observation teaches that an excessively large
number of hideous, misshapen, crippled, and wretched creatures have
failed to react to their deficiencies by developing a neurosis. Nor
will I consider the interesting information that the sense of inferiority
goes back to infantile feelings. It shows us in what disguise
the doctrine of infantilism, so much emphasized in psychoanalysis,
returns in Adler’s Individual Psychology. On the other
hand, I am obliged to emphasize how all psychological acquisitions
of psychoanalysis have been disregarded by Adler. In his book
“The Nervous Character,” the unconscious still appears as a psychological
peculiarity, but without any relation to his system. Later,
he declared, quite logically, that it was a matter of indifference to
him whether any conception be conscious or unconscious. For the
principle of repressions, Adler never evinced any understanding.
While reviewing a lecture before the Vienna Society in 1911, he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_48">48</span>said: “On the strength of a case I wish to point out that the patient
had never repressed his libido, against which he continually tried to
secure himself.”<a id="r20"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Soon thereafter at a discussion in Vienna Adler
said: “If you ask whence comes the repression, you are told: from
culture. But if you ask whence comes culture, the reply is: from
the repression. So you see it is only a question of a play on words.”
A small fragment of the sagacity used by Adler to defend his
“nervous character” might have sufficed to show him the way out of
this pettifogging argument. There is nothing mysterious about it,
except that culture depends upon the acts of repression of former
generations, and that each new generation is required to retain this
culture by carrying out the same repressions. I have heard of a
child that considered itself fooled and began to cry, because to the
question: “Where do eggs come from?” it received the answer,
“Eggs come from hens,” and to the further question: “Where do
the hens come from?” the information was “From the eggs,” and
yet this was not a play upon words. The child had been told what
was true.</p>

<p class="c005">Just as deplorable and devoid of substance is all that Adler has
said about the dream—that shibboleth of psychoanalysis. At first
he considered the dream as a turning from the masculine to the
feminine line, which simply means translating the theory of wish-fulfillment
in dreams into the language of the “masculine protest.”
Later he found that the essence of the dream lies in the fact that it
enables man to realize unconsciously what is denied him consciously.
Adler should also be credited with the priority of confounding the
dream with the latent dream-thoughts, on the cognition of which
rests his idea of “prospective tendency.” Maeder followed him in
this, later on. In doing so he readily overlooks the fact that every
interpretation of the dream which really tells nothing comprehensible
in its manifest appearance rests upon the same dream interpretation,
whose assumptions and conclusions he is disputing. Concerning
resistance Adler asserts that it serves to strengthen the patient
against the physician. This is certainly correct. It means as much
<span class="pageno" id="Page_49">49</span>as saying that it serves the resistance. But whence this resistance
originates, and how it happens that its phenomena serve the patient’s
interest, these questions, as if of no interest for the ego, are not
further discussed by Adler. The detailed mechanisms of symptoms
and phenomena, the motivation of the variety of diseases and morbid
manifestations, find no consideration at all with Adler, since everything
is equally subservient to the “masculine protest,” to the self-assertion,
and to the exaltation of the personality. The system is
finished, at the expense of an extraordinary labor of new interpretation,
yet it has not contributed a single new observation. I believe
that I have succeeded in showing that his system has nothing whatever
in common with psychoanalysis.</p>

<p class="c005">The picture which one derives from Adler’s system is founded
entirely upon the impulse of aggression. It has no place at all for
love. One might wonder that such a cheerless aspect of life should
have received any notice whatever; but we must not forget that
humanity, oppressed by its sexual needs, is prepared to accept anything,
if only the “overcoming of sexuality” is held out as bait.</p>

<p class="c005">The secession of Adler’s faction was finished before the Congress
at Weimar which took place in 1911, while the one of the Swiss
School began after this date. Strangely enough, the first indications
of it were found in some remarks by Riklin in popular articles
printed in Swiss literature, from which the general public learned,
even before Riklin’s closest colleagues, that psychoanalysis had
succeeded in overcoming some regretable mistakes which discredited
it. In 1912 Jung boasted, in a letter to me from America, that his
modifications of psychoanalysis had overcome the resistances to it
in many persons, who hitherto wanted to know nothing about it. I
replied that this was nothing to boast about, that the more he
sacrificed of the hard-won truths of psychoanalysis, the less resistances
he would encounter. This modification for the introduction
of which the Swiss are so proud, again was nothing more or less
than the theoretical suppression of the sexual factor. I admit that
from the very beginning I have regarded this “progress” as a too-far-reaching
adaptation to the demands of actuality.</p>

<p class="c005"><span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>These two retrogressive movements, tending away from psychoanalysis,
which I will now compare, also resemble each other in the
fact that they are seeking to obtain a favorable opinion by means
of certain lofty points of view, as <em>sub specie æternitatis</em>. In the case
of Adler, this rôle is played by the relativity of all knowledge, and
by the rights of the personality to construe artificially any piece of
knowledge to suit the individual; while Jung insists on the cultural
historical rights of youth to throw off any fetters that tyrannical old
age with ossified views would forge for it. These arguments
require some repudiation. The relativity of all our knowledge is a
consideration which may be used as an argument against any other
science besides psychoanalysis. This idea originates from well-known
reactionary streams of the present day, inimical to science,
and wishes to give the appearance of a superiority to which we are
not entitled. Not one of us can guess what may be the ultimate
judgment of mankind about our theoretical efforts. There are
examples to show that what was rejected by the next three generations
was corrected by the fourth and its recognition thus brought
about. There is nothing else for the individual to do than to defend,
with all his strength, his conviction based on experience after he
has carefully listened to his own criticisms and has given some attention
to the criticisms of his opponents. Let him be content to conduct
his affair honestly and not assume the office of judge, which is
reserved for a remote future. To accentuate personal arbitrariness
in scientific matters is bad; it evidently wishes to deny to psychoanalysis
the value of a science, which, to be sure, Adler has already
depreciated by the aforementioned remark. Any one who highly
regards scientific thinking will rather seek for means and methods
by which to restrict, if possible, the factor of personal and artificial
arbitrariness wherever it still plays too large a part. Besides one
must remember that all agitation in defending is out of place. Adler
does not take these arguments seriously. They are only for use
against his opponents, but they respect his own theories. They have
not prevented Adler’s own adherents from celebrating him as the
Messiah, for whose appearance waiting humanity had been prepared
<span class="pageno" id="Page_51">51</span>by so many forerunners. The Messiah is surely no longer anything
relative.</p>

<p class="c005">Jung’s argument <em>ad captandam benevolentiam</em> rests on the all-too-optimistic
assumption that the progress of humanity, of civilization,
and of knowledge has always continued in an unbroken line,
as if there had never been any epigones, reactions, and restorations
after every revolution, as if there had never been races who, because
of a retrogression, had to renounce the gain of former generations.
The approach to the standpoint of the masses, the giving up of an
innovation that has proved unpopular, all these make it altogether
unlikely that Jung’s correction of psychoanalysis could lay claim to
being a liberating act of youth. Finally it is not the years of the
doer that decide it, but the character of the deed.</p>

<p class="c005">Of the two movements we have here considered, that headed by
Adler is undoubtedly the more important. Though radically false,
it is, nevertheless, characterized by consistency and coherence and it
is still founded on the theory of the impulse. On the other hand,
Jung’s modification has lessened the connection between the phenomena
and the impulses: besides, as its critics (Abraham, Ferenczi,
Jones) have already pointed out, it is so unintelligible, muddled, and
confused, that it is not easy to take any attitude towards it. Wherever
one touches it, one must be prepared to be told that one has
misunderstood it, and it is impossible to know how one can arrive at
a correct understanding of it. It represents itself in a peculiarly
vacillating manner, since at one time it calls itself “a quite tame
deviation, not worthy of the row which has arisen about it” (Jung),
yet, at another time, it calls itself a new salvation with which a new
epoch shall begin for psychoanalysis, in fact, a new aspect of the
universe for everything else.</p>

<p class="c005">When one thinks of the disagreements between the individual
private and public expressions of Jung’s utterances one is obliged to
ask to what extent this is due to his own lack of clearness and lack
of sincerity. Yet, it must be admitted that the representatives of the
new theory find themselves in a difficult position. They are now
disputing things which they themselves formerly defended and what
<span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>is more, this dispute is not based on new observations which might
have taught them something fresh, but rather on a different interpretation
which causes them to see things in a different light from that
in which they saw them before. It is for this reason that they will
not give up their connection with psychoanalysis as the representatives
of which they first became known in the world. They prefer
to proclaim that psychoanalysis has changed. At the Congress of
Münich I was obliged to clear up this confusion and did so by
declaring that I could not recognize the innovation of the Swiss
School as a legitimate continuation and further development of the
psychoanalysis which had originated with me. Outside critics (like
Furtmüller) had already recognized this state of affairs and Abraham
says, quite rightly, that Jung is in full retreat away from
psychoanalysis. I am naturally entirely willing to admit that any
one has the right to think and to write what he wishes, but he has
not the right to make it out to be something different from what it
really is.</p>

<p class="c005">Just as Adler’s researches brought something new into psychoanalysis,
a piece of the ego-psychology, and paid only too dearly
for this gift by repudiating all the fundamental analytic principles,
in the same way Jung and his adherents have based their fight
against psychoanalysis upon a new contribution to the same. They
have traced in detail (what Pfister did before them) how the
material of the sexual ideas originating in the family complex and
in the incestuous object selection can be used to represent the highest
ethical and religious interests of mankind, that is, they have explained
a remarkable case of sublimation of the erotic impelling
forces and the transformation of the same into strivings that can no
longer be called erotic. All this harmonized very well with the assumptions
of psychoanalysis, and would have agreed very well with
the conception that in the dream and in the neurosis one sees the
regressive elucidations of these and all other sublimations. But
the world would have exclaimed that ethics and religion had been
sexualized. I cannot help assuming “finally” that the investigators
found themselves quite unequal to the storm they had to face.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>Perhaps the storm began to rage in their own bosoms. The previous
theological history of so many of the Swiss workers is as important
in their attitude to psychoanalysis as is the socialistic record of
Adler for the development of his “psychology.” One is reminded
of Mark Twain’s famous story about the fate of his watch and to the
speculative remark with which he closed it: “And he used to wonder
what became of all the unsuccessful tinkers, and gunsmiths, and
shoemakers, and blacksmiths; but nobody could ever tell him.”</p>

<p class="c005">I will encroach upon the realm of parables and will assume that
in a certain society there lived a parvenu who boasted of descent
from a very noble family not locally known. But it so happened
that it was proved to him that his parents were living somewhere in
the neighborhood and were very simple people, indeed. Only one
way out remained to him and he seized upon it. He could no longer
deny his parents, but he asserted that they were very aristocratic
by origin but much come down in the world, and secured for them
at some obliging office a document showing their descent. It seems
to me that the Swiss workers had been obliged to act in a similar
manner. If ethics and religion could not be sexualized, but must
be regarded as something “higher” from the very beginning, and as
their origin from the family and Œdipus complexes seemed undeniable,
then there was only one way out; namely, that these complexes
themselves, from the beginning, could not have the significance
which they appeared to express, but must have that higher
“anagogic” sense (to use Silberer’s nomenclature) with which they
adapt themselves for proper use in the abstract streams of thought
of ethics and religious mysticism.</p>

<p class="c005">I am quite prepared to be told once more that I have misunderstood
the contents and object of the theory of the New Zürich
School, but here wish to protest against being held responsible for
those contradictions to my theories that have arisen as a result of
the publications of this school. The burden of responsibility rests
on them, not on me. In no other way can I make comprehensible
to myself the ensemble of Jung’s innovations or grasp them in their
associations. All the changes which Jung has perpetrated upon
<span class="pageno" id="Page_54">54</span>psychoanalysis originated in the intention of setting aside all that is
objectionable in the family complexes, in order that these objectionable
features may not be found again in religion and ethics. The
sexual libido was replaced by an abstract idea, of which it may be
said that it remained equally mysterious and incomprehensible alike
to fools and to the wise. The Œdipus complex, we are told, has
only a “symbolical” sense, the mother therein representing the
unattainable which must be renounced in the interests of cultural
development. The father who is killed in the Œdipus myth represents
the “inner” father from whose influence we must free ourselves
in order to become independent. No doubt other portions of
the material of sexual conceptions will, in time, receive similarly
new interpretations. In place of the conflict between erotic strivings
adverse to the ego and the self-assertion, we are given the
conflict between the “life-task” and the “psychic laziness.” The
neurotic guilty conscience corresponds with the reproach of not
having put to good account one’s life-task. Thus a new religio-ethical
system was founded which, exactly like Adler’s, was obliged
to give new interpretations, to distort or set aside the actual results
of analysis. As a matter of fact they have caught a few cultural
higher notes from the symphony of the world’s by-gones, but once
again have failed to hear the powerful melody of the impulses.</p>

<p class="c005">In order to hold this system together it was necessary to draw
away entirely from the observations and technique of psychoanalysis.
Now and then the enthusiasm for the higher cause even permits a
total disregard for scientific logic, as for instance, when Jung maintains
that the Œdipus complex is not “specific” enough for the
etiology of the neuroses, and ascribed this specificity to laziness,
that is, to the most universal quality of animate and inanimate
bodies! Moreover, it is to be remarked that the “Œdipus complex”
only represents a capacity on which the psychic forces of the
individual measure themselves, and is not in itself a force, like the
“psychic laziness.” The study of the individual man has shown
and always will show that the sexual complexes are alive in him
in their original sense. That is why the study of the individual was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_55">55</span>pushed back by Jung and replaced by the judgment of the essential
facts from the study of the races. As the study of the early childhood
of every man exposed one to the danger of striking against the
original and undisguised meaning of these misinterpreted complexes,
it was, therefore, thought best to make it a rule to tarry as little as
possible at this past and to place the greatest emphasis on the return
to the conflict. Here, moreover, the essential things are not at all
the incidental and personal, but rather the general, that is to say, the
“non-fulfilment of the life-task.” Nevertheless, we know that the
actual conflict of the neurotic becomes comprehensible and solvable
only if it can be traced back into the patient’s past history, only by
following along the way that his libido took when his malady began.</p>

<p class="c005">How the New Zürich therapy has shaped itself under such
tendencies I can convey by means of reports of a patient who was
himself obliged to experience it.</p>

<p class="c005">“Not the slightest effort was made to consider the past or the
transferences. Whenever I thought that the latter were touched,
they were explained as a mere symbol of the libido. The moral
instructions were very beautiful and I followed them faithfully, but
I did not advance one step. This was more distressing to me than
to the physician, but how could I help it?—Instead of freeing me
analytically, each session made new and tremendous demands on
me, on the fulfilment of which the overcoming of the neurosis was
supposed to depend. Some of these demands were: inner concentration
by means of introversion, religious meditation, living together
with my wife in loving devotion, etc. It was almost beyond my
power, since it really amounted to a radical transformation of the
whole spiritual man. I left the analysis as a poor sinner with the
strongest feelings of contrition and the very best resolutions, but at
the same time with the deepest discouragement. All that this
physician recommended any pastor would have advised, but where
was I to get the strength?”</p>

<p class="c005">It is true that the patient had also heard that an analysis of the
past and of the transference should precede the process. He, however,
was told that he had enough of it. But as it had not helped
<span class="pageno" id="Page_56">56</span>him, it seems to me that it is just to conclude that the patient had
not had enough of this first sort of analysis. Not in any case has
the superimposed treatment which no longer has the slightest claim
to call itself psychoanalysis, helped. It is a matter of wonder that
the men of Zürich had need to make the long detour via Vienna to
reach Bern, so close to them, where Dubois cures neuroses by ethical
encouragement in the most indulgent fashion.<a id="r21"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c005">The utter disagreement of this new movement with psychoanalysis
naturally shows itself also in its attitude towards repression,
which is hardly mentioned any more in the writings of Jung; in
the utter misconstruction of the dream which Adler, ignoring the
dream-psychology, confuses with the latent dream-thoughts, and
also in the lack of understanding of the unconscious. In fact this
disagreement can be seen in all the essential points of psychoanalysis.
When Jung tells us that the incest-complex is only “symbolic,”
that it has “no real existence,” that the savage feels no desire
towards the old hag but prefers a young and pretty woman, then one
is tempted to assume in order to dispose of apparent contradiction
that “symbolic” and “no real existence” only signify what is
designated as “existing unconsciously.”</p>

<p class="c005">If one maintains that the dream is something different from the
latent dream-thoughts, which it elaborates, one will not wonder that
the patients dream of those things with which their mind has been
filled during the treatment, whether it be the “life-task” or being
“above” or “below.” Certainly the dreams of those analyzed are
guidable in a similar manner as dreams can be influenced by the
application of experimental stimuli. One may determine a part of
the material that occurs in the dream, but this changes nothing in
the nature and mechanism of the dream. Nor do I believe that the
so-called “biographical” dream occurs outside of the analysis. On
<span class="pageno" id="Page_57">57</span>the other hand, if we analyze dreams that occurred before the treatment
began, or if attention is paid to what the dreamer adds to the
stimuli supplied to him during the treatment, or if we avoid giving
him any such task, then we can convince ourselves how far the
dream is from offering tentative solutions of the life-task. For the
dream is only another form of thinking; the understanding of this
form can never be gained from the content of its thoughts, only the
consideration of the dream-work will lead to it.</p>

<p class="c005">The effective refutation of Jung’s misconceptions of psychoanalysis
and his deviations from it is not difficult. Any analysis
carried out in accordance with the rules, especially any analysis of
a child, strengthens the convictions on which the theory of psychoanalysis
rests, and repudiates the new interpretations of Adler’s and
Jung’s systems. Jung himself, before he became enlightened, carried
out such an analysis of a child and published it.<a id="r22"></a><a class="c009 pginternal" href="#f22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> It remains to be
seen if he will undertake a new interpretation of this case with the
help of another “uniform new tendency of the facts,” to give
Adler’s expression used in this connection.</p>

<p class="c005">The opinion that the sexual representation of “higher” ideas in
the dream and in the neurosis is nothing but an archaic manner of
expression, is naturally irreconcilable with the fact that these sexual
complexes prove to be in the neurosis the carriers of those quantities
of libido which have been withdrawn from the real life. If
it were only a question of sexual jargon, nothing could thereby be
altered in the economy of the libido itself. Jung himself admits this
in his “Darstellung der psychoanalytischen Theorie,” and formulates,
as a therapeutic task, that the libido investing the complexes
should be withdrawn from them. But this can never be accomplished
by rejecting the complexes and forcing them towards sublimation,
but only by the most exhaustive occupation with them,
and by making them fully conscious. The first bit of reality with
which the patient has to deal is his malady itself. Any effort to
spare him this task points to an incapacity of the physician to help
<span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>him in overcoming his resistances, or to a fear on the part of the
physician as to the results of this work.</p>

<p class="c005">I would like to say in conclusion that Jung, by his “modifications”
has furnished psychoanalysis with a counterpart to the
famous knife of Lichtenberg. He has changed the hilt, has inserted
into it a new blade, and because the same trademark is engraved on
it he requires of us that we regard the instrument as the former one.</p>

<p class="c005">On the contrary, I believe I have shown that the new theory
which desires to substitute psychoanalysis signifies an abandonment
of analysis and a secession from it. Some may be inclined to fear
that this defection may be more unfortunate for the fate of psychoanalysis
than any other because it emanates from persons who once
played so great a part in the psychoanalytic movement and did so
much to further it. I do not share this apprehension.</p>

<p class="c005">Men are strong so long as they represent a strong idea. They
become powerless when they oppose it. Psychoanalysis will be able
to bear this loss and will gain new adherents for those lost.</p>

<p class="c005">I can only conclude with the wish that the fates may prepare
an easy ascension for those who found their sojourn in the underworld
of psychoanalysis uncomfortable. May it be vouchsafed to
the others to bring to a happy conclusion their works in the deep.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
