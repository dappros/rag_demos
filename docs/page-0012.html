  <h2>Speech by the President of Ukraine at the National Council of the Slovak Republic</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-10</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. Speaker of the National Council! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear parliamentarians! Dear journalists! Dear Slovak people! Pozdravujem Vás s Kyjiva! It is an honor for me to address you today. And I want to start with words of gratitude for all the help that Slovakia has given to Ukraine. We greatly appreciate your defense support. And your determination in this support, which proves that you realize that freedom without force is just a fantasy and nothing more. It would be good if some other countries in Europe and the world learn this from you. We appreciate your solidarity with Ukraine at the level of the European Union. This was the case before February 24, when Russia launched a full-scale war and so it is now. Last year, we, with your President, Ms. Zuzana Čaputová, signed a Declaration of Recognition of the European Perspective of Ukraine. The significance of that step has now only grown stronger. Russia&#x27;s war against our state is not only an attempt to seize our land, subdue our people and erase Ukrainian identity. Russia went to war in fact against all of united Europe, starting with Ukraine. This war is actually being waged by Russia against each of the states that want to live freely and choose their own future. That want to choose which unions to be in, who to be friends with and how to trade. This war is against the very project of a common alliance based on common values on our continent. What are these values? Respect for life, human rights, inviolability of borders and freedom. The Prime Minister of Slovakia, Mr. Eduard Heger, was one of our first foreign friends to visit the suburbs of Kyiv and see with his own eyes what the Russian occupiers have done there. Last week, Bucha and Borodyanka were also visited by your colleagues from the Slovak Parliament. They also saw with their own eyes what evil Russia is carrying. Thousands of crimes by Russian occupiers against civilians have been recorded in the Kyiv region alone. Murders, torture, abductions, looting and robberies have been reported. It is recorded that the occupiers tried to destroy everything that is connected not only with the Ukrainian national idea, but also simply with culture. What is the point of shelling and destroying schools in the area where the occupiers entered? They even destroyed schools! What does this mean? That we are at the epicenter of the confrontation of two ideas: the European democratic idea that the freedom and life of everyone matters and the cruel tyrannical idea that only a person who can subdue other people matters. That&#x27;s what we need to stop together. Everyone in Europe. Because if we don&#x27;t stop it, Russian troops will repeat the crimes they committed in Bucha and Borodyanka on the land of every state they can reach, in particular on the territory of your state. So the first and foremost tool to win this confrontation is weapons. And I can say on behalf of all our people that Ukrainians will always remember how Slovakia gave our country at a crucial time what really helped us. And there is potential to continue this cooperation, in particular, in the issue of aviation – aircraft, helicopters. You know, our flag, which is now very often seen by all Europeans in their cities – I am grateful to them – it reflects our fertile land – fields of yellow wheat. And also our beautiful blue sky. We have people to defend our land. But in the skies we need more support, including yours. The second tool is sanctions against Russia. Together with the use of effective weapons by our Armed Forces, sanctions create a truly reliable protection for the European idea. Because if the source of aggression weakens, life becomes more secure for everyone in Europe. The European Union is now agreeing on the sixth package of sanctions against Russia. And this is the required package, including the energy restrictions that are provided for in it. I understand that this is a challenge for you and some other countries. For Slovakia, the issue of Russian oil and the possibility of its replacement is not a matter of immediate action. We understand everything. But I want to give you, as our friends, one Ukrainian example. To make you better understand us. For a long time, Russian politicians have been fighting for the supply of Russian gas to Ukraine. They offered various supposedly profitable options – completely non-market, cheap and convenient, especially for Moscow. They offered to get a political decision from us about a larger volume of supplies and an easier scheme of payment for Russian gas. Not so long ago, Ukraine was one of the biggest sales destinations for Gazprom. What did it lead to? Ukraine depended not only on Russian gas, but also on Russian political decisions. And any attempt to move at least to market conditions in supply ended in gas wars, and ultimately in a bonded gas agreement, which posed a direct threat to our sovereignty. Ukrainian politicians have also been playing for a long time with the issue of placing the Russian Black Sea Fleet on the territory of Ukraine – in our Crimea. In particular, they talked about the conditions of the so-called lease for the fleet, linking the gas issue to this. It seems that there may be some benefit to the state from the feigned discount on Russian gas when the Russian fleet remains on Ukrainian territory. While this fleet was just a cover to capture a territory. An umbrella for issuing passports to our people by Russia – our people in Crimea. For propaganda and creeping annexation, which could only be completed by the invasion, and it happened in 2014. That&#x27;s what happened in our history. And this is what I advise all our friends, who may become at least one percent more politically dependent on Russia, to avoid. We were the first to see Russia breaking agreements when it simply stopped liking them. We saw Russia turn commercial ties into a chain to keep another state close to it. The Russian Black Sea Fleet was used to capture Crimea. And now it is blocking the sea for us and firing missiles at our peaceful cities. Well, Russia is trying to use gas now to have the entire European continent obedient. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Slovak people! Ukraine has gone through the mistakes that our friends can learn. Russian energy is not just a commodity. It should be abandoned, especially oil, because it&#x27;s really a question of freedom. Yes, protecting freedom has a price. And the third aspect I would like to talk about today. This is the future of the European Union. Russia&#x27;s attempts to blackmail, split and weaken Europeans clearly show that all of us on the continent must respond with even greater unity. Even greater integration. Even with greater joint protection of our values. This is an important element of the very force that makes freedom not just a fantasy. Even more unity in Europe is possible only in one case – if Ukraine right now, in the conditions of war, gets a real opportunity to move faster to the European Union. The issue of granting EU membership candidate status to Ukraine in June this year is a matter of protecting the entire European project. As well as the issue of economic support for Ukraine. It is impossible to fight without the economy. And Russia is doing everything to destroy our economy. As an example, most of the Russian missiles that hit Ukrainian land hit the economic infrastructure. Therefore, the priority is to establish alternative routes for our exports, in particular, through the territory of Slovakia. And greater financial support for Ukraine from the European Union. And I ask you to be our voice in the European Union when it comes to defending the relevant positions from the destructive doubts of those who value freedom less than you. After more than two months of the full-scale war, Ukrainians, together with all our friends on the European continent who have shown solidarity in defending freedom, have proved that Moscow will never be able to repeat what it did in 1968 and all other attempts to spread tyranny. By the way, this is how I interpret the decision to award me your State Award of Alexander Dubček. I am grateful for it. But to really fully respond to the mockery of freedom then, in 1968, and to the attempts to mock freedom now, we still have to fight. We must strengthen our unity and put pressure on Russia until we see that victory has been achieved. I know that a donors&#x27; conference will be held in Bratislava in June to activate assistance for Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who participates in its organization, including the GLOBSEC think tank. And I believe that we will be able to discuss specific projects to restore normal life in different regions of Ukraine at this Bratislava site. Because the more actively we cooperate, the more we put pressure on Russia. And the more we strengthen European unity, the clearer the contours of our victory are. Our victory. Thank you, Slovakia! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to liberate all our cities and our people - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-10</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today has been a difficult day. There was news - both ordinary and tragic. I&#x27;ll start with international contacts. I continued to address foreign parliaments. Those states and nations whose support is important to us. And especially now. In my address to the Slovak Parliament, I thanked for the strong defense, sanctions and other support. I explained our view on why energy cooperation with Russia cannot be considered in isolation from the aggressive policy of this country. And on the Ukrainian example, recalling the history of so-called gas friendship with Russia, I showed what mistakes should be avoided. Addressing the Maltese Parliament, I recalled the heroic battle for Malta in World War II, which is very similar in fact to our current struggle in the war for independence and freedom against Russia. Then, 80 years ago, the fate of the entire confrontation in the Mediterranean depended on the battle for Malta. The Allies won. The Nazis lost. We are doing everything to ensure that the confrontation on our land ends in this way now as well. And for this we need principled support and sanctions. In particular, from Malta. I held talks in Kyiv with the foreign ministers of Germany and the Netherlands. We talked about the strengthening of Ukraine, about the faster end of this war. We also discussed the details of how our friends can join the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. I am also grateful to them for resuming the work of embassies in our capital. This is an important gesture that confirms Europe&#x27;s confidence in Ukraine&#x27;s future. In total, 36 foreign missions are already operating in the capital. The Armed Forces of our state provided us all with good news from the Kharkiv region. The occupiers are gradually being pushed away from Kharkiv. I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders. Once the second most powerful army in the world. But I also want to urge all our people, and especially those in the rear, not to spread excessive emotions. We shouldn’t create an atmosphere of specific moral pressure, when certain victories are expected weekly and even daily. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to liberate our land and our people. To liberate all our cities - Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Mariupol and all others. Today, a special group of international experts chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak proposed a roadmap for energy sanctions. This is a detailed document that describes what needs to be done to make it really difficult for Russia to finance this war, but at the same time - so that the global economy does not suffer losses due to restrictions on Russian energy resources. This is a rationally drafted document, and work has already begun on its implementation. And the tragic news on which I want to end this address today. The first President of Ukraine Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk died today. He was not just a politician. And not just a historical figure. He was the man who knew how to find wise words and say them so that all Ukrainians could hear them. This is especially important in difficult, crisis moments. When the future of an entire country may depend on the wisdom of one person. Leonid Makarovych showed just such wisdom in the late 1980s, when the Ukrainian movement emerged. He passed 1991 brilliantly, and it is only now that it may seem as if it was easy for him then. And no matter what happened later, Leonid Kravchuk always stayed with Ukraine. Perhaps it was because of his wisdom that he was cheerful in a special way. He always valued life, every minute of it. But he always found much more than one minute to help sort things out and give advice. And I am personally grateful to him in particular for that. As a child he survived World War II, survived the occupation. Leonid Makarovych knew what freedom costs. And with all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine. I&#x27;m sure we will implement it. We will achieve our victory and our peace. Eternal honor and memory to the first President of independent Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who defended Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to students of leading French universities</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-11</span></div>
  <p>I am glad to greet you from our capital, from Kyiv. Today is the 77th day of Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against our state. And it happens 77 years after the end of the largest war in Europe - World War II. When that war ended, political leaders and nations sought to create a security architecture that would make it impossible to repeat the war in Europe. And when I say the word &quot;security&quot; now, I use it in the broad sense of the word. It is not only a military component, but also economic, political, educational, cultural and memorial. Europeans have done a lot to ensure that the continent always has the opportunity to resolve any issues through dialogue. Through communication. So that it is not possible for one politician, one person or a group of politicians to provoke a large-scale war again, which will take thousands or even millions of lives. And, by the way, the contribution of students, including French students, to such changes in Europe is extremely significant. Since May 1968, there has been no politician who would not fear that people would come to him and say: it is forbidden to forbid. But why, despite all this, all this history, do we in Europe now have no tool to stop Russian aggression, except the courage and wisdom of Ukrainian men and women who defend our state? How did it happen that the whole security architecture that was created in Europe after World War II did not work? And not only did not work, but to a large extent did not even try. 77 days of brutal Russian war, which can truly be called a total war to destroy the Ukrainian people. Cities and villages in Ukraine were destroyed. You know this. There is nothing left of the city of Volnovakha in Donbas. Before this war about 20 thousand people lived there. Now it&#x27;s all ashes. The half-million city of Mariupol is now just ruins. How many people are there now? Several tens of thousands out of half a million. At least 20,000 Mariupol residents were killed by Russian strikes at the city. Unfortunately, there are many such examples in Ukraine. Today, 12 million people have been forced to flee the war and become internally displaced persons. More than 10,000 Russian military crimes have been recorded. And this is just what is legally recorded as of this day. How did all this become possible? And why are no global or European institutions enough now to stop this war? You know, I don&#x27;t want these questions to remain rhetorical. These questions really need to be answered, because these questions are actually about you and me, about Europe. About how we all live. From the Atlantic region to our cities, our communities in the Kharkiv region and in Donbas, which right now, right now, while we are here with you, are being fired upon by Russian troops from artillery, aircraft, and so on. I was told that the rules of our meeting today provide for my address and the opportunity for five students to ask certain questions. I think this is still an unfair regulation. Five questions are not enough to understand a person and to understand the situation. And it will look like a privilege for a few when thousands listen to us. But I understand that you and I have limited time. I&#x27;m also interested in asking you questions to hear what you think. So that it is really communication. For example, about NATO. About world security. About the architecture of this security. About the 5th article of the Treaty. For years, Europe has feared Ukraine&#x27;s accession to NATO, because if a war broke out with Russia - they said so - everyone would have to fight against it. I would rather say - for Ukraine. But isn&#x27;t that the point of NATO? Isn&#x27;t that all for one? And if Russia goes further, for example to the Baltic countries, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia - any country. Will NATO fight against Russia, for example, for Latvia? Will Article 5 work then, given that most of you have never been to Latvia and may not even have ties to that country? There is also another aspect to this. Russia has already started a war against Ukraine, but we are not in NATO. And then why are we not in the European Union? Russia has already started a war. And you see how it fights. What else can you be afraid of now? And why does our common European home still have an internal division between those who were admitted and Ukraine? Which is behind the door, but at the same time fighting, defending European values, EU values: freedom and other fundamental values. And here is my second question to you: why did one person, Vladimir Putin, decide to start a war? It was a wrong and catastrophic decision. But why did he still approve it? And is there now in Europe, perhaps even in France or in any other country, a man or woman who can also start such a war against neighbors? Of course, I don&#x27;t want that for anyone. But are we protected from this? Are you protected from this? One more question of mine to you - why did the Russian military, when occupying the territory of Ukraine, torment people with such pleasure and so massively? Why didn&#x27;t they just shoot or capture or kill people like in war. Why did they rape, why did they torture people? Why did they cut off people&#x27;s heads, fingers, why did they break legs? Why did Russian soldiers rape children in front of their parents? How can you - already adults - explain this? In your opinion, did they have just such an order or are they just like that? For example, a nine-year-old girl. Or an eleven-year-old boy. What should be in the head of a Russian soldier who rapes them in front of their parents, in front of their mother? Hundreds of such crimes have been recorded. There was even a Russian soldier who raped a baby and recorded a video of it, and then showed it to everyone. And how many such cases were in the occupied territories, about which we do not know yet? During World War II, the Nazis committed horrific crimes against all the nations of Europe. In particular, against Ukrainians and against Russians. For 77 years, much has been done to preserve the memory of those terrible crimes, which would ensure that they will never happen again. But why did the Russian military, when they came to Ukraine, start doing what the Nazis did? How did this become possible? My next question to you is: when will justice be restored? Why is there still no tool in the world that can bring all war criminals to justice quickly? Exactly quickly. Of course, our state will do everything to bring to justice every war criminal. And I am grateful to everyone who helps us. In particular, France. But there is an aspect of time. How long will it last? When will murderers and torturers receive sentences? And how to get them for trial, if they hide in Russia and if nothing changes there? There are many people of the future and different professions among you, and there are lawyers among you. Let them find the answer. So what can we do to speed up international justice? And what punishment do these criminals deserve? Specifically which one? What could be enough punishment for raping a child or shooting cars with refugees right on the roads just for fun? There were hundreds and thousands of such cases. And my fifth question to you is not difficult - personal. What influences politics and what influences the decision whether to engage in politics? Are you ready to get involved in politics? Would you like your father to be President? President of a state that defends itself in war and fights not just for independence, but literally for the right to life for its people? Or President of France - a state in peace? I want to explain my feelings to you. The feelings when you have a double responsibility - both for the state, because you are the President, and for your family, which found itself in a very special situation. When I decided to run for president, my daughter (she’s now 18) was against it - totally. She was aware of how much life would change. It is a question of publicity, a question of security, certain responsibility - of the children of the President already. What do you think about it? And how would you feel now if you were the son or daughter of the President? So, as I understand, we have little time. And I would like you to give answers to my questions. And I can answer yours. It is important for this meeting of ours to be truly communication. And I would like to hear from you. At the end, I can ask the last question. If I get all the information from you. Thank you for your attention!</p>

  <h2>We will liberate our land and people, and with the help of the free world it will be easier to do – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-11</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Unbreakable people of our country! We have a series of important news - clearly positive for our defense. First. The House of Representatives of the United States Congress voted for a new and significant package of support for our state and global democracy. Almost $ 40 billion. A second vote will be held soon in the US Senate. This decision will then be signed by President Biden and will take effect. I am grateful to the people of America and to all our friends in Congress and Administration for their support. What exactly is positive? These funds will be used as quickly as possible and without bureaucracy to strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s defense. First of all, it is weapons and ammunition for us, equipment. But not only that. It is also a support for the investigation of war crimes of the Russian Federation, the occupiers, support for diplomatic work and more. The second decision is important and even historic. This is an update of America&#x27;s famous Lend-Lease program. People who remember history well know that Lend-Lease was one of the key preconditions for the Allied victory in World War II. Lend-Lease assistance from the United States to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union has dramatically changed the balance of power in Europe. Europeans then received a wide range of products under Lend-Lease - from aircraft to trucks, from aviation fuel to communication means. By the way, American radio stations and other things provided under Lend-Lease worked for the Soviet people long after the war. For decades. Hitler&#x27;s Germany, even with all the resources in the occupied territories, could do nothing to counter this potential of the Allies on the basis of American productive capacities. And it is no coincidence that the new Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act was signed on May 9. I am personally grateful to President Biden for this support, for this decision and for such symbolism. Because we are now defending freedom and the right to life for all free nations in the war against tyranny, which poses no less of a threat to Europe than it did 80 years ago. Simply put, Lend-Lease is a scheme to give us everything we need for defense. Although formally it is like a loan, in fact it is so profitable that it is incorrect to call it a loan. Firstly, we will have access to modern weapons, ammunition, equipment, and we do not need to look for options to pay for it all. Secondly, now the President of the United States will not have to agree with Congress on the assistance he provides. This will speed up the delivery. And there is one more thing that should be said separately. Ukraine is constantly discussing security guarantees for itself with our friends in a very substantive way. The G7 meeting on May 8, in which our state took part for the first time at the level of leaders, was first and foremost about that. We are negotiating with the world&#x27;s leading nations to give Ukraine confidence in security for decades to come. This is the first time in the history of our state when it is possible to fix such guarantees. Not something in the memorandum, not some declarative desire for some kind of course, but specific guarantees. Not only legally significant, but also spelled out so that it is clear: what exactly, who exactly and how exactly guarantees us. God willing. Of course, all these things will not work in one or several days. But I am sure that this May will be of special significance in Ukrainian history. Yes, Russian troops are still on our land. Those outcasts whom the Russian state has found for itself as collaborators make statements of cosmic scale and cosmic stupidity, as their level was characterized in &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot;. But no matter what the occupiers do, it doesn&#x27;t mean anything. They stand no chance. I am confident that we will liberate our land and people. By the way, today in communication with students of French universities I felt such confidence in their questions. And with new support from the United States, with Lend-Lease, with all the help we get from the UK and the European Union, from Canada, Japan, Australia – without exaggeration, from the whole free world – it will be easier for us. I also spoke today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. On defense assistance to Ukraine, energy cooperation and new sanctions. New – against Russia. Step by step, we are doing everything to make the aggressor most hurt by aggression. However, speaking about the help of partners, we must not forget that victory is gained directly by Ukrainians who are fighting. By all who beat the enemy and strengthen the defense. Just yesterday, 404 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine (posthumously) was awarded to Colonel Ihor Bedzay, Chief of the Aviation Security Service - Senior Inspector-Pilot of the Naval Command. In total, more than 13,000 of our servicemen received state awards during the full-scale war. This definitely characterizes the courage of all our defenders. I am grateful to each and every one of them! Very grateful. Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for us, for everyone. For Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by the President of Ukraine at The Atlantic Council’s Distinguished Leadership Awards</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-12</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! On behalf of all Ukrainians, I would like to thank you for this award. It is a fair and correct gesture to honor with this award all the people of Ukraine, because courage is our national trait of character. Today the whole world witnesses this and admires the heroism of Ukrainians. At the same time, I want it not to become something ordinary for everyone. And for this we must say and remember that behind the courage and wisdom of our people, there are thousands of real stories, names and heroic feats. The world should know about them and to have a clear idea and understanding about the people of Ukraine. First of all, we are the nation of the best defenders. These are our ground forces, air and naval forces, airborne assault troops, special operations forces, the National Guard, intelligence, border guards, and territorial defense fighters. This is Vitalii Skakun, who blew up a bridge sacrificing himself to stop a column of Russian tanks. This is 21-year-old lieutenant Vitalii Sapilo, who neutralized 30 units of equipment of the enemy and died from an air strike. Serhiy Pantelyuk, who was injured while repelling the attack and died at the hospital while his first daughter was being born. These are the border guards of Zmiinyi Island, who were not afraid of the flagship of the Russian fleet - cruiser Moskva - and sent a Russian ship in a direction that became world-famous. These are the indomitable defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal, who have been holding the line there for several months. These are all our fighters who died defending Ukraine, hence defending Europe. I would like to ask you to honor their memory with a moment of silence. Thank you. The Ukrainian people are people who do not spare themselves for the sake of others. This is combat medic Diana Kukurudziak, who pulled 16 wounded soldiers off the battlefield in one day. Paramedic Serhiy Chornobryvets in Mariupol, who has been on duty for 22 days since the beginning of the war. The Ukrainian people are a nation of courageous children. This is 11-year-old Maksym, who said nothing to his mother, ran away from home and came to ask for permission to be a part of territorial defense. This is 7-year-old Varya from Kropyvnytskyi who gave her money saved for a smartphone to buy bulletproof vests, and then sold flowers and drawings. This is a 15-year-old girl from the Luhansk region who was driving a car with shot legs and took out four wounded. A 15-year-old boy who carried his wounded mother in his arms for 3 kilometers to the evacuation point. Our people are also elderly people who have experienced too many ordeals. This is Borys Romanchenko, who passed through the hell of Buchenwald and died at the age of 96, at home, during the shelling of Kharkiv by the Russian Federation. This is Vanda Obiedkova, who as a child, hiding in the basement, survived the Holocaust and the Nazi occupation of Mariupol, saw the second occupation of the city in 2014, and the third - this year. At the age of 91, she had to hide in the basement again, where she died on the 40th day of the war. This is 87-year-old Halyna Kotubey from Mykolaiv region, who remained the only and last resident of her village, but refused to leave. The Ukrainian people are a nation where hundreds of thousands fight and millions help. This is a business that has shifted to the needs of the country. Clothing designers sew military uniforms, restaurateurs feed free lunches, bakeries bake bread for IDPs and lonely people. This is a university professor who continues to lecture to his students in the trenches. A violinist playing for people during an air alarm in a bomb shelter. These are civilians of Ukrainian cities and villages, who became a living wall on the way of the occupiers – stopping military machines and turning tanks in the opposite direction. These are inhabitants of Demydivka, who flooded their own village not to let the occupier into Kyiv. Those who despite threats, shots and stun grenades go to peaceful rallies, reminding the occupants that this is Ukraine: Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all other cities and villages of Ukraine occupied not for a long time. These are millions of Ukrainians who are now defending their Homeland and the whole world. Do not be afraid and come to Ukraine. Hear thousands of similar stories about us, Ukrainians. Look into their brave eyes, shake their strong hands, and you will see that they are doing all this not for glory, that they need not only awards, but also concrete help and support. Weapons, equipment, financial support, sanctions on Russia, and the most important: the feeling that in this difficult struggle they are not alone, that they are supported by you, by the whole world – free states and free nations of our planet. Thank you! Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Thank you for the award and welcome to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia&#x27;s strategic defeat is obvious to everyone in the world, Russia simply lacks courage to admit it so far - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-12</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! I do not tire of repeating these words, addressing everyone - everyone who defends the state. Today these words sound special. On the International Nurses Day. The professional holiday of tens of thousands of Ukrainian women, as well as Ukrainian paramedic officers who are doing one of the most important things for victory - saving the lives of our soldiers, our civilians. Today I had the honor to present state awards to the representatives of this profession. Those who did not stop working and rescuing people under enemy fire and during the occupation. Tetiana Tarasenko, Alla Chernets and Liudmyla Husak from the Sumy region. Vira Tselyk, Oksana Umanets and Iryna Vernyhora from Chernihiv. Oksana Balandina from the Luhansk region. Svitlana Klymenko and Maria Adamenko from the Kyiv region. Natalia Abashnyk from Kharkiv. With all my heart I thank all the nurses, all the medical workers who help Ukrainians fight every day and every night. And today I urge everyone who has not yet thanked them to do so. Eight years of war in Donbas, two years of pandemic, the third month of full-scale war and all their professional life they dedicate to you, us, everyone - society. So that Ukraine lives. I was very pleased to see the working conditions of our doctors at the Center for Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery in Kyiv. The new building of the Center was built as part of our Large Construction program. And this is a truly modern building. There you feel that our medical system, our medicine can really be on a par with the world&#x27;s best medical systems. We invested in the development of medicine and all social infrastructure before the war, and we will definitely continue to do so after the war. Let the occupiers not hope that they will stop us. During the fighting since February 24, Russian troops have destroyed 570 healthcare facilities. 101 hospitals were completely destroyed. What is it? This is nonsense. This is barbarism. This is the self-destruction of Russia as a state that at least someone in the world could look at as a cultural nation. Tonight they struck at the Chernihiv region, at schools. Of course, the Russian state is in such conditions that any education only hinders it. But what can be achieved by destroying Ukrainian schools? All Russian commanders who give such orders are just sick. Incurably. But all the hospitals that the occupiers destroyed, all the schools, all the universities that they bombed, all the houses, bridges, businesses - we will rebuild everything. The occupiers struck today at the Poltava region, at Kremenchuk. Again at the plant, so that people do not have fuel. Really sick. At the Zaporizhzhia region, at the cities and villages of Donbas. But what does it give them? Russia&#x27;s strategic defeat is already obvious to everyone in the world and even to those who still continue to communicate with them. Russia simply lacks courage to admit it so far. They are cowards. And they are trying to hide the truth behind missile, air and artillery strikes. Therefore, our task is to fight until we achieve our goals in this war. Free our land, our people and reliably ensure our security. I spoke with the President of Finland. We discussed Ukraine&#x27;s European integration and defense cooperation. I also spoke with Slovak President Zuzana Čaputová. I thanked her for the support provided to Ukraine. We agreed on the next steps in the whole spectrum of relations: defense, sanctions, economy, including fuel imports, and further rapprochement with the European Union. I am preparing to continue special formats of communication with friendly societies, in particular with students from partner countries. I will address American students soon. And students from European countries as well. We must spread our Ukrainian ideas and explain at all levels how we, Ukrainians, see life in Europe and the world after this war. A war that changes everything in world politics. I am grateful to the friend of Ukraine, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, for today&#x27;s address to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. This is an important gesture of support. More importantly, the Netherlands is advocating the abandonment of Russian oil and is ready to do so without delay. I signed decrees awarding our defenders. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Kachur Roman Volodymyrovych, Commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade of the Operational Command &quot;East&quot; of the Ground Forces. 269 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 14 of them posthumously. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>To work every day to make the war shorter - this is our priority - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-13</span></div>
  <p>Unbreakable people of our most beautiful country! Our defenders! Today we can report on the 200th downed Russian military aircraft. Russia has not lost so many aircraft in any war in decades. And Russia has lost almost 27,000 soldiers, many of them young conscripts. Russia has lost more than three thousand tanks, armored combat vehicles, a large number of conventional military vehicles, helicopters, drones and all its prospects as a state. And why all this? For a monument to Lenin to stand in the temporarily occupied Henichesk for a little longer? There is no other result for Russia and there will not be any. In fact, no one today can predict how long this war will last. But we are doing everything we can to liberate our land quickly. This is our priority - to work every day to make the war shorter. However, this depends, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already doing the maximum. It also depends on our partners. On European countries, on the countries of the whole free world. I am grateful to all those who are working to strengthen sanctions on Russia and to increase defense and financial support for us, for Ukraine. This is the only recipe for defending freedom in the face of Russia&#x27;s invasion. And for Western countries, it&#x27;s not just expenditures. It is not about accounting. It is about the future. The world has already recognized that Russia&#x27;s blockade of our ports and this war are provoking a large-scale food crisis. Russian officials are also openly threatening the world that there will be famine in dozens of countries. And what could be the consequences of such a famine? What political instability and migration flows will this lead to? How much will you have to spend then to overcome the consequences? These are the questions that need to be answered by those who are delaying sanctions on Russia or trying to postpone aid to Ukraine. Every day of war is an increase in global threats, it is a new opportunity for Russia to provoke instability in other parts of the world, not only here in Europe. And these are new lost lives in Ukraine: Ukrainian men and women who give their lives so that everyone can live freely. I emphasize this: everyone, especially in those countries where they still find time to argue instead of investing in aid as much as possible. Therefore, much more pressure on Russia is needed. And I talk about it openly and daily to everyone on whom it depends. We continue to restore the de-occupied territories of Ukraine. As of today, 1015 settlements have been de-occupied, which is plus six in the past 24 hours. We return electricity, water supply, communications, transport, social services there. It is important. Of course, we remember every city and every community that is still under occupation. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all cities and towns of Donbas... The gradual liberation of the Kharkiv region proves that we will not leave anyone to the enemy. We do not stop trying to save all our people from Mariupol and Azovstal. Currently, very difficult negotiations are underway on the next stage of the evacuation mission - the rescue of the seriously wounded, medics. It is a large number of people. Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate everyone else, each of our defenders. Everyone in the world who can be the most influential mediator has already been involved in the relevant negotiations. Already 37 foreign missions have resumed their work in Kyiv. And I am grateful to all of them, because this is 37 proofs that Ukraine stands strong and has prospects in contrast to the Russian Federation. I am sure that other foreign missions will return to the capital soon. It is worth returning to work for all Ukrainian businesses that have not yet resumed operations, although they may do so in a safe area. Providing jobs and adjusting economic activity to the existing conditions is also a big contribution to defense, to our future. Traditionally, I signed a decree on awarding our heroes. 212 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. Eternal glory to everyone who defends our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Support for Ukraine means working to prevent a global famine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-14</span></div>
  <p>Wise people of our bravest country! All our defenders! Last year, on May 14, the Day of Remembrance of Ukrainians who saved Jews during World War II was celebrated in our country for the first time. 2659 Ukrainian men and women received the title of Righteous Among the Nations. Our country is the fourth in the world in the number of the Righteous. People who risked their lives, the lives of their loved ones, but still saved those who were threatened with imminent death at the hands of the Nazis. Rescued children, adults, whole families. Each of these rescue stories is impressive. It strikes with courage, because there was total evil around, and people still kept good in their hearts. It strikes with belief that humanity will still win despite the then occupation and the power of the Nazis. The Righteous were in all regions of our state - from Zakarpattia to Crimea, from Odesa to Kharkiv. And we do not know all the stories of salvation. There were many who simply did not have time to tell thanks to whom their life was saved. They also rescued very young children who simply could not understand what was really happening to them. We must always remember that our people have such Righteous among them and that even in the darkest circumstances there are people who carry light. This is exactly the same striving for good that we see today in Ukrainian men and women who help save people from the occupiers, from the same Nazis. I am grateful to all journalists and just all caring people who document modern stories of salvation and record for all generations of our people what Ukraine has to go through and how people show their best qualities saving others - acquaintances and strangers, relatives, children, adults. I held talks today with a delegation of US senators led by Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitchell McConnell in Kyiv. I believe that this visit once again demonstrates the strength of bipartisan support for our state, the strength of ties between the Ukrainian and American nations. We discussed various areas of support for our state, including defensive and financial. As well as tightening sanctions on Russia. I expressed gratitude for the historic decision to renew the Lend Lease program. I called for the official recognition of Russia as a terrorist state. One of the issues I deal with on a daily basis is food security. More and more countries around the world are realizing that Russia, by blocking the Black Sea for us and continuing this war, puts dozens of other countries at risk of a price crisis in the food market and even famine. This is another incentive for our anti-war coalition to act more decisively together. Now support for Ukraine - and especially with weapons - means working to prevent global famine. The sooner we liberate our land and guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s security, the sooner the normal state of the food market can be restored. The situation in Donbas remains very difficult. Russian troops are still trying to show at least some victory. On the 80th day of the full-scale invasion, it looks especially insane, but they do not stop all these efforts. I am grateful to everyone who holds the line and brings closer to Donbas, Pryazovia and Kherson the same thing that is happening now in the Kharkiv region. Step by step we are forcing the occupiers to leave our land. We will make them leave the Ukrainian sea as well. By the way, now in many cities and communities of Ukraine there are discussions about renaming streets and squares. My advice is to turn to the stories of the Ukrainian Righteous and perpetuate their memory. Because it is about the courage and humanity of Ukrainians who have already proved that the evil that comes to our land will inevitably lose. Eternal glory to all our defenders! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are doing everything to maintain the world&#x27;s maximum attention to Ukraine and our needs - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-15</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! The 81st day of our defense is coming to an end and another week of round-the-clock work for Ukraine and victory is beginning. This week, as always, there will be a lot of international activity in which I will take part. The key is weapons and financial support for Ukraine. Finances not only to maintain stability now, but also to begin rebuilding what Russia has ruined. We are also working to strengthen sanctions on Russia. Partners need to make decisions that limit Russia&#x27;s ties to the world every week. The occupiers must feel the rising cost of war for them, feel it constantly. Now the priority is the oil embargo. No matter how hard Moscow tries to disrupt this decision, the time of Europe&#x27;s dependence on Russian energy resources is coming to an end. And that can’t be changed. Another task, which becomes even more important the longer the war lasts, is to do everything to maintain the world&#x27;s maximum attention to us, to Ukraine. Information about our needs should be in the news of all countries that are important to us constantly and every day. In particular, for this purpose - for greater information and political support of Ukraine - on Monday I will communicate with students of leading American universities. These are 63 US universities and two Canadian universities, which unite hundreds of thousands of students and are a large expert and research community. Their voice will definitely strengthen our capabilities. A separate address to Stanford University students is also planned for the end of May. I am also preparing to communicate with Ukrainian students from the leading universities of our country. In my address to them I will answer some important difficult questions that already exist in our society, which are already visible. And I expect profound questions from them, from our students. I will definitely continue to address the parliaments of Ukraine&#x27;s European partner states. Our task is the status of a candidate for EU membership for Ukraine, and later - accession to the European Union under the fast-track procedure. Every state matters. Every vote counts. It is equally important to have the maximum consent of European countries in the issue of strengthening sanctions on Russia. That is why I will be addressing the Luxembourg Parliament in the near future. By the way, we are also working to expand the geography of such special speeches in the parliaments of Africa and Asia. An address to the participants of the Davos Forum is scheduled for May 23. This year the conference will be especially important for our country. Post-war reconstruction will be discussed. We are doing our best to fully gather the support of the world, and participation in the Davos Forum is one of the best opportunities for that. We continue very complicated and delicate negotiations to save our people from Mariupol, from Azovstal. We deal with this issue on a daily basis. And the main thing is for the agreements to be fulfilled. We expect the United States to adopt important decisions for our country. A new significant package of support and detailed elaboration of the renewed historical program of the Lend-Lease. We are preparing for new attempts by Russia to attack in Donbas, to somehow intensify its movement in the south of Ukraine. The occupiers still do not want to admit that they are in a dead end and their so-called &quot;special operation&quot; has already gone bankrupt. But the moment will surely come when the Ukrainian people will force the invaders to fully recognize reality. No matter how &quot;creative&quot; they are in Kherson and Melitopol, no matter how they portray their alleged &quot;power&quot; in the occupied areas of Pryazovia and Donbas, they are there temporarily. The Ukrainian flag, Ukrainian law, Ukrainian life will still be there anyway. Today&#x27;s Russian missile strikes at the Lviv region, shelling of Hulyaipole, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, cities and communities of the Donetsk region - all this brutality of the occupiers, which Ukraine is experiencing every day, will only lead to the fact that Russian surviving soldiers will bring this evil back to Russia. They will bring it back because they will retreat. This is how all the feverish activity of the Russian military we see now will end. And I am grateful to all the Ukrainians who are bringing this time closer. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to American students during online communication with the US university community</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-16</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity, I am grateful for the honor to address the students today, to answer your questions. Not all of you, however, look like students. You are already rectors, already heads of educational institutions, presidents. But as far as I understand, the student community hears us and it is very important that it sees us. This is really important. Because my speech is dedicated to them and then I will be ready for a dialogue. To them exactly, because the speech is about choice. This is the age when you have to make a choice. The main choice that everyone makes in one way or another in his life. Makes at this, I would say, golden age, student age. Or even earlier. When choosing the answer to the question of who he is. Who are you? What are you like? I will give you my example so that you can feel what I am talking about and what I wanted to tell you. Who am I? I am the President of Ukraine. I studied law. Then practiced in court. Then I became an artist, producer, businessman. And then I became a President - the President of our beautiful state. And each of these stages was supposedly a different life. But in fact, it&#x27;s one life. This is the answer to the question of who you are in life. Are you a subject or are you just watching? Are you trying to change something or not? Are you worried - and that&#x27;s all, or are you worried and trying to help, fix, do something? It is a choice that determines life. What you will be. What your country will be like. Each of you, students, even if you don&#x27;t realize it, makes that choice. Every day. And then it becomes your character, it becomes your destiny. For example, each and every one of you in life has probably been in a situation where there is hatred next to you. When a person insults another person in word or deed. When another person is humiliated. When someone is trying to take something from another person. Are there many who will help in this situation? There are those who just watch. Someone will shoot a video with a smartphone, it is very popular now, and then post it on Instagram or YouTube. Someone may just laugh. And someone will still help. Stop the humiliation. Stop the hatred. Help a person feel dignity again. There are many situations when the word can mean salvation for a person. Who feels that life is not going in the right direction. Or when a mistake is made. Seemingly a terrible and fatal mistake. After which you may not want to live at all. We have all seen such situations in the movies. When a person may attempt suicide. And some have seen it in real life. And some have faced a choice - whether to try to help or not? Or just to walk by? Whether to shoot a video of what you see and then collect likes and shares on your social network? It is good that there are people who do not stay away. Those who take the situation into their own hands and help. I remember a terrible day for your nation and for the whole democratic world - 9/11. I then watched the attack on the &quot;twins&quot; on TV - with my friends. And some of them just couldn&#x27;t believe what was happening. Some even said that this could only happen in America. And he was told very quickly that it could happen in any country, it could happen to anyone. Because terror knows no borders. I remembered how shortly before September 11 I was in New York, I was there - in the &quot;twins&quot;. And I felt that it could happen when I was there. That I could be among thousands of people - either in the towers or next to them. And I would be faced with the same choice - how to escape? How to save others? Who to help? And could I be able to help myself? When one day you decide for yourself that you have to be the master of your life, then you always stay with that power and look for what to do. After the full-scale invasion of Russia, I heard a lot of advice. All of them came down to the fact that we have to accept that Ukraine has become a victim. Victim of the occupation of Russia. That there is almost no chance for resistance. That the Russian army will allegedly take down all our resistance very quickly - three or five days. And that it is supposedly better for me to just leave Ukraine, because no one will be able to stop Russia. I was offered help with transport instead of help with weapons! But it was just not about us. These were completely wrong proposals. They did not take into account who we are. Who I am. How we see life here in Ukraine. Our country will never be a victim again. It will not just be an observer of life - including its own life. We can, want to and will be subjects in life. We made this choice. This is my choice. And the choice of the vast majority of Ukrainian citizens. This is where our strength comes from, our strong desire for the freedom we are fighting for. And I am grateful to those who made that choice with us. Who also decided to be the subject of life and the struggle for principles, and they are the same for us - the struggle for freedom. There is case law in your country. If once - even a long time ago - a decision was made at the appropriate level by a proper court, similar cases are decided according to this precedent. This is always taken into account. The same is true, in fact, in international politics. What is Russia doing now? It is trying to set a precedent. If it manages to break the statehood of the neighboring nation, other states will do the same. What is Ukraine doing now with its partners? Trying to set another precedent. So that all the aggressors in the world once and for all see that the war will create the biggest problems for them - for the aggressors. So that they know that the hatred they spread against ordinary people like you and me, against other nations, will strike first and foremost at themselves when the free world refuses to deal with those who spread such hatred. This is a very transparent process of struggle. And everyone chooses a role in it. There are states that are trying to stay away. Be supposedly neutral. And not help fight for our common values. It&#x27;s the same as in life, when help is needed, and there is only a crowd of people watching instead of helping. And there are states that contribute as much as possible to protect freedom. To stop the aggression. To guarantee the force of international law. It is this role that the United States has chosen, and I am very grateful to your people, to your leaders for that choice. After all, it is also the answer to who you want to be in life. Those who do not want to be just a victim or an indifferent observer. But those who can and do defend democracy, because that is how they protect themselves as well. Their freedom, their way of life, their people. Their worldview in which there should be no room for individual violence or brutal wars. Each of you right now - at this age and in the position you are in - chooses this for yourself. How do you respond to challenges? What do you do when you see injustice? And I really want you to choose this path for yourself. The path of clear awareness of who you are. The path of agency. Because if it is your choice, it will always be the choice of your country. Just as it is the choice of our country. Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive - this is our principle - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-16</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 82nd day of our defense is coming to an end. A difficult day. But this day, like all others, is aimed precisely at saving our country and our people. Regarding the situation in Mariupol. Thanks to the actions of the Ukrainian military - the Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence, the negotiating team, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations, we hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys. Among them are the seriously wounded, they are being provided with medical aid. I want to emphasize: Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle. I think that every adequate person will understand these words. The operation to rescue the defenders of Mariupol was started by our military and intelligence officers. To bring the boys home, the work continues, and this work needs delicacy. And time. We also maintain maximum diplomatic activity in other areas in the interests of Ukraine. I spoke today with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. On how to speed up the provision of financial assistance to Ukraine, given the state budget deficit during the war, which is about $ 5 billion a month. We also talked about the main directions of further cooperation. On the eve of the meeting of the G7 finance ministers, these talks with the IMF Managing Director are a direct preparation for very important decisions for Ukraine. A high-ranking Polish delegation worked in Kyiv. Consultations with them were held regarding cooperation at the European Union level. In particular, it concerns the acceleration of our integration into the European Union and the expected decision on the candidate status for Ukraine. We are also working to ensure that the European Union agrees on a sixth package of sanctions on Russia. The oil embargo must be a part of it, and it is in the interests not only of our state, but also of the whole of Europe. I am grateful to those leaders of the continent who are aware of this and help promote the respective decision. I addressed the student community of the United States of America - representatives of leading universities. I also talked to the rectors and presidents of these educational institutions. The key issue is to involve American universities in rebuilding our education system after the war. In addition, we discussed political issues, including the protection of democracy, countering Russian propaganda and fakes. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are repelling constant attacks in those areas where Russia is still trying to advance. Severodonetsk and other cities in Donbas remain the main targets for the occupiers. We do everything to protect our land and our people. I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 201 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Senior Lieutenant Ahasyiev Kyrylo Yashar oğlu - platoon commander of the 92nd separate mechanized brigade. And posthumously to Lieutenant Colonel Yerk Vyacheslav Volodymyrovych, commander of the aviation squadron of the 40th tactical aviation brigade. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today there is a war for freedom again, and again it is necessary for cinematography not to be dumb - address by the President of Ukraine to the filmmaking community at the opening of the 75th Cannes International Film Festival</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-17</span></div>
  <p>It is a great honor for me to address you. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends! I will tell you a story. Indeed, a lot of stories begin with the words &quot;I will tell you a story&quot;. But in this one, the finale will be much more important than the beginning. And this will not be an open ending. Finally, it can put an end to a battle that has lasted more than a hundred years. This battle began with the arrival of the train. The hero and the antagonist came out of it. And so the confrontation on the screen was born, which turned into real life. First, cinematography appeared in our life, then it became our life. And then, what the future would be like depended on cinematography as well. My story today is about this battle. About the battle. And about the future. The worst dictators of the 20th century loved cinematography. It is known about them. But the most important thing left after them is the eerie documentary footage of the newsreel. As well as movies that challenged these dictators. The first festival was to begin on September 1, 1939 in Cannes. But World War II broke out. For six years, cinematography has been on the frontlines of this war, along with all mankind. For six years, cinematography has been fighting for freedom, and also, unfortunately, for the benefit of the dictatorship. Now, going back to that movie, we can see how freedom was moving towards victory. And in the end, it did not allow dictators to capture people&#x27;s hearts. There were many important points along the way. However, the most outstanding was in 1940. When, in contrast to the antagonist, the world saw, at first glance, an inconspicuous guy who did not look like a hero at all. But he turned out to be so. &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; by Charlie Chaplin did not destroy the real dictator then. But thanks to it, cinematography ceased to be dumb. Dumb in every sense of the word. Cinematography spoke, and it was the voice of the future victory of freedom. Even then, in 1940. When the screens sounded: “The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…” Since then - since those words of the hero played by Chaplin - mankind has produced many beautiful movies. It seemed that everyone already understood that one can conquer people with the beautiful, gathering them near the screens, and not with the ugly, gathering them in bomb shelters. It seemed that everyone already believed that the horror in the form of a full-scale war that could cover the entire continent would not have continuation. But again, as then, there is a dictator. Again, as then, there is a war for freedom. Again, as then, it is necessary for cinematography not to be dumb. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. Planning to go further to Europe. And what kind of war is this? I want to answer this question as clearly as possible. Armed with the words that were said by cinematography in the years after the previous continental war. You have already heard most of these words. They sound eerie. On the screen. But, unfortunately, this has become a reality. Remember that? Remember how it sounded in the movies? “You smell that? Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning…” Yes, it started in Ukraine in the morning. At four o&#x27;clock, when we heard the first missile explosions. When the air strikes began. And when death, going to Ukraine across the border, marked its equipment with the swastika analogue - the &quot;Z&quot; symbol. &quot;They all want to be better Nazis than Hitler...&quot; Now, there is not a single week passing without mass graves of killed and tortured people found in the territory where Russian troops were or still are. 229 children were killed as a result of the Russian invasion. “They can&#x27;t get anywhere but kill, kill, kill! They have sown Europe with corpses…” You saw what the Russian military did in the small town of Bucha. You saw Mariupol. Saw Azovstal. Saw the theater blown up by a Russian bomb. By the way, it was similar to where you are now. Ordinary civilians were hiding there from the shelling. Two large and noticeable inscriptions &quot;Children&quot;. They were on the asphalt near the theater. And we will never forget it, because it is not even Hell. “War isn&#x27;t Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse…” More than 2,000 Russian missiles have already hit Ukraine. Dozens of cities were completely destroyed. Scorched villages. More than 500,000 Ukrainians have been deported to Russia by force. Tens of thousands are in Russian camps created on the model of Nazi camps. No one knows how many prisoners will survive there. But everyone knows who is to blame. “You think soap can wash you?” Unlikely. The worst war since World War II is already in Europe. First of all, because of one person who is in Moscow. Other people die every day. And they will not come to life after the phrase &quot;Stop, cut!&quot;. But what do we hear about it now? Will the movie be silent or will it speak? If there is a dictator, if there is a war for freedom and if again, as then, everything depends on our unity, will cinematography remain outside this unity? Our cities are not destroyed by virtual graphics. Many Ukrainians have become Guido and are trying to explain to children why they have to hide in the basement. Many Ukrainians have become like Aldo Raine. The land of our country is already streaked with thousands of trenches. Of course, we will continue to fight. And we have no alternative but to fight for freedom. And I am sure that the dictator will lose. But words should sound like in 1940. Sound from all screens of the free world. We need a new Chaplin, who will prove again that cinematography is no longer dumb. Remember how it sounded then: “Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness… To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair… The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.” We must finally win this battle. And we need cinematography that will provide just such a finale. So that every voice is on the side of freedom. And, as it has always been seen, first of all the voice of cinematography. I thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Missile shelling of a number of regions and subversive activity at the border are an attempt of the Russian army to compensate for a series of failures in the east and south of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-17</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 83rd day of our defense began with a rather powerful combination of Russian strikes at Ukraine. Missile shelling of the Lviv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region. Air strikes in the Luhansk region. Specific sabotage activity in the border areas of Ukraine. All this is not just creating tension for our state, not just testing our strength. This is a kind of attempt of the Russian army to compensate for a series of failures in the east and south of our country. They cannot demonstrate success with general military action in the areas where they are trying to advance. So they are trying to show success through their missiles and other activities. To no avail as well. These strikes, like many previous ones, do not change anything radically. Especially since our air defense and anti-sabotage measures are becoming stronger. I had a conversation today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Quite productive. First of all, about the defense support for Ukraine, about our cooperation at the EU level. I informed him about the current situation on the battlefield and the possible development of this situation. I had a conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron. Substantive and long. We discussed the sixth package of sanctions being prepared in the European Union. We also discussed the negotiation process with Russia and evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. The evacuation mission continues, it is overseen by our military and intelligence. The most influential international mediators are involved. We also spoke separately and substantively with the President of France about our European integration steps and the consideration of Ukraine&#x27;s application for EU candidate status. I continue to gather the largest possible international audience for Ukraine. To support our state at all levels. And to put pressure on Russia at all levels. Information, diplomatic and cultural pressure is what we need. So that, as in the days of World War II, the struggle for freedom can rely in particular on the power of art. So today, during the opening ceremony of the Cannes Film Festival, I addressed the world filmmaking community. I reminded that now, as in the 1940s, it is necessary to boldly and openly defend freedom and fight the dictatorship. Right now is the time. When the language of cinematography can and should become the language of the struggle for freedom. Today I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 165 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 13 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 3 servicemen of the 24th separate mechanized brigade. To those who showed extraordinary courage and efficiency in the battles in Donbas. Today I bid farewell to the first President of Ukraine Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk. The ceremony took place in Kyiv. In Kyiv, which will remain Ukrainian. The capital of an independent state. From 1991 and forever. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who fought for independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Crimean Tatar Genocide</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-18</span></div>
  <p>Dear citizens! All our great people! On this day last year, I said we would be back. Return to Crimea. Every year on May 18, Ukraine commemorates the victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar people. The people whom they wanted to deprive of their homeland. The people whom they wanted to deprive of their lives. The people whose history and whose name they wanted to erase. But the people who managed to return home. Managed to preserve themselves and the truth. On May 18, 1944, the Soviet authorities began the forced deportation of the indigenous people of Crimea, the Crimean Tatars, from their only homeland. After the terrible war that took place in Crimea, as well as throughout Ukraine, as well as throughout Europe, the whole people was then put on the brink of survival. During and after the deportation, when the Crimean Tatar people were forced to live abroad, almost half of the IDPs died. Almost half the people! It was a deliberate crime of tyranny against the people and against humanity as such. Today we turn again to what was experienced then. And we are doing this in conditions when the descendants of that tyranny are not only trying to deprive Crimean Tatars of their home for the second time - since 2014. They also want to take away the home of the entire multi-million Ukrainian people - all who live on our land. Significant territories are under the occupation of the Russian army. There are so-called filtration camps, through which hundreds of thousands of people pass. The occupiers are destroying our cities, our villages. They forced more than 12 million Ukrainian men and women to leave their home. And again, like 78 years ago, they are forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of our people abroad to remote areas. Last year, on May 18, addressing the people, I recalled the lines of the Crimean Tatar poetess Lilya Budzhurova &quot;When we return&quot;: When all our people return home / You will have to remember where we were born / You will have to remember where you yourself were born / Showed up as uninvited guests here. And this year, in the days of this war, we prove: Ukraine is really coming back. The truth is coming back. And people are coming back. A full-scale invasion of Russia, inspired by the worst the world has seen in the 1940s, raises from ashes the experience of that time. However, it encourages us to return these occupiers to what all anti-human regimes ultimately go through, namely, their defeat. The territory of the northern regions of our state has already been liberated. We are returning the Kharkiv region. Defenders of our state are repelling the most desperate efforts of the occupiers in Donbas. The Armed Forces of Ukraine simultaneously repel the attacks of Russian troops in the south. We defend Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Odesa. And we remember every city and every community that is still under occupation. I always emphasize: under temporary occupation. And, of course, we remember Crimea. The occupying forces have already suffered such defeats in Ukraine that Russia has not seen in various wars for decades. Poisoned by state propaganda, many Russians are simply unaware of this yet. They do not want to see how big their losses are - in different senses of the word. People, economy, culture, future. But life will make them feel these losses. In 1944, expelling the Crimean Tatars from their land, the then torturers were convinced that none of the displaced would return home, to Crimea. Now, trying to occupy Ukraine and destroy our lives, the current torturers of the people were also convinced that everything would work out for them and that we would not be able to endure it. And we endured. And we are struggling to bring life back to every corner of our home. And we are coming back. Today, on this very day, I am signing the law &quot;On Social and Legal Protection of Persons Deprived of Personal Freedom as a Result of Armed Aggression against Ukraine and Members of Their Families&quot; adopted by the Verkhovna Rada. This law is to protect all those ordinary peaceful, civilian people who have been repressed by the occupiers and who have been taken prisoner by them. This law is, in particular, for Nariman Dzhelyalov and many others who are deprived of their liberty by strangers in Crimea, in their native home. For those who are being held in prisons on the peninsula and who have been deported to Russia. This law is for the relatives and friends of all prisoners of the Kremlin - in Donetsk, Luhansk, in all those areas, and in Crimea. For all who have been tormented by the enemy. This is help and protection. And we will definitely restore justice. Qırım serbest olacaq! Eternal memory to all victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar people!</p>

  <h2>Russia is trying to find its &quot;wonder weapon&quot;, which indicates the complete failure of the invasion and the fear of admitting catastrophic mistakes - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-18</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, one of the representatives of the Russian state said that the occupiers allegedly began to use laser weapons systems in Ukraine. Allegedly to save missiles. Firstly, it is noteworthy that they need to save missiles and somehow explain it. That is, more than two thousand missiles fired by the Russian army at Ukraine were the main part of their stockpile of missiles. That is, only the remnants are left. Secondly, everyone has already seen Russia at war. Inexperienced conscripts, which it throws into battle like cannon fodder. Marauders who see normal appliances for the first time in a foreign country. Old Soviet &quot;armor&quot; without modern protection. Forbidden phosphorous bombs, which they use to burn schools and ordinary houses. And missiles, most of which were spent by the Russian army on the destruction of absolutely civilian infrastructure without any strategic military outcome. Today they hit missiles in such a way at Mykolaiv and Dnipro. Well, in the propaganda of Nazi Germany there was such a term &quot;wunderwaffe&quot;. Wonder weapon. The clearer it became they had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about the wonder weapon, which would be so powerful that it would provide a turning point in the war. And here we see that in the third month of a full-scale war, Russia is trying to find its &quot;wunderwaffe&quot;. Allegedly laser. All this clearly indicates the complete failure of the invasion. But again, this also shows that they are afraid to admit that catastrophic mistakes have been made at the highest state and military levels in Russia. Therefore, they will come up with more and more &quot;wunderwaffe&quot; as the Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our defenders liberate our land step by step. How long will it take? The answer to this question can only be given by the real situation on the battlefield. We are trying to do it as soon as possible. That&#x27;s for sure. We are obliged to drive out the occupiers and guarantee Ukraine real security. That is why I signed decrees on the extension of the legal regime of martial law and the term of general mobilization. I hope that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine will support this decision in the near future. Our army and all those who defend the state must have all the legal tools to act steadily. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all of our cities and communities that are under occupation - under temporary occupation - should know that Ukraine will return. I said today in my address on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Deportation of the Crimean Tatar People that our state does not leave anyone behind and returns what belongs to Ukraine by right. We remember Crimea. And we will never forget 1944 - the genocide of Crimean Tatars committed by the Soviet authorities. And 2014 - the second wave of destruction of everything free on the Crimean peninsula. Especially on this day I signed the law on the protection of persons deprived of liberty by the occupiers, as well as on the protection of family members of such people. We are talking about all the Kremlin prisoners - both in Crimea and in the occupied part of Donbas. The law gives them more protection and assistance from the state. We are also accumulating all possible resources of the world to support Ukraine. I am grateful to Andriy Shevchenko, our legendary football player, for becoming the first ambassador of the new national brand of Ukraine - United24. The state needs this platform right now, which allows, in particular, to raise funds to support Ukraine. Anyone in the world - in one click - can contribute to our victory. And in the direction he or she considers most important. For example, defense and demining, medical care or rebuilding the country. And in early June we will be able to see the first special event in London with the participation of Andriy Shevchenko in support of United24. I thanked President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for the package of aid to our country announced today. Its amount is 9 billion euros. And also for supporting the plans for restoration of Ukraine. This step by the European Commission is a testament to the true leadership that the European Union is capable of. And it will definitely help us in the struggle for our common freedom. I spoke with the new President of the United Arab Emirates. Congratulated him on his election and invited to take part in the post-war reconstruction of the state. We discussed the threat to global food security that Russia had provoked by the invasion. And traditionally in the evening I signed the decree on awarding our heroes. 197 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 5 of them - posthumously. Also today I had the honor to present the Order of the Golden Star to servicemen who were previously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. In particular, to Colonel Serhiy Baranovsky for courage and efficiency in the battles in Donbas. And to Colonel Serhiy Musienko for personal courage and success in the battles in the Kharkiv region. Eternal glory to the defenders of Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our independence and freedom. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to students and rectors of higher educational institutions of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-19</span></div>
  <p>I am really glad to have the opportunity to talk to you today and I hope that this will be exactly communication. Not a lecture or seminar, which I&#x27;m sure you already have enough. I would like to build a dialogue with you, so in my speech I will ask questions, and I am interested to hear each and everyone who would like to answer. So when you ask your questions, please choose one or several of my questions and give your answer. Let&#x27;s start. This is a very special time for our country. Millions of our people are now fighting for the right to life and freedom for our people. And it really opens up a space of possibilities. Right now it is our country that is in a situation where we can choose the future for it as we decide. That is, it is not just an adaptation to the conditions created for Ukraine by other generations or even other states. As it is for other countries, and as it was for our state before the war. We can consciously reshape our lives. Here is what is possible now. These are great opportunities, this is the time to determine which Ukraine you want to live in. So my first question to you today is about this: what should our state be like? And this question logically continues with a number of related questions. Do you want to live in Ukraine? Do you expect changes from Ukraine to live here? Or, on the contrary, you believe that our country already has everything for you to live here. Let&#x27;s move on. There are many countries in the world that are talking about reforms. Even the most developed ones always have it. The words &quot;the system is not working and needs to be fixed.&quot; This is a common narrative for many politicians. But in few countries, as in ours now, there are opportunities not just to &quot;fix&quot; the existing system, but to create a new one. Based on what is best. Not only here, now. But also in those countries where it would be worth taking the best. Of course, this war put an end to many things from the life of Ukraine before. But not to all. For example, our people who have gone abroad while the hostilities are going on say that certain things in our lives are much more progressive than in other countries. Digitization, which we started doing in the public sphere. Internet and communication, which are very accessible due to business. The service sector, in which speed and willingness to work is often greater than in many European countries. It turned out so. We must also not forget that even during a full-scale war, our institutions did not break down. Banking sphere works. The budget system and public administration have endured. Defense and logistics are ensured despite the fact that the enemy in some respects has more forces and equipment. That is, society has a certain foundation, and it would be unwise not to use it. But we must understand that Russia will always be there. And it may always be a threat. After February 24, we have already achieved a lot. And now, for example, you can see how the world evaluates our potential in a fundamentally different way. Perhaps you have seen how two Forbes articles are compared, very interestingly: the headline of February 12 - will Russia invade Ukraine; and the headline of May 16 - will Ukraine’s army invade Russia. That is, the world began to look differently at the situation in our region and the balance of power. But it is important what we think about ourselves. What our people feel about our state. So, my next question to you: what should Ukraine be like so that you can be sure that we can protect ourselves from any threat? This question also continues with a number of others. For example, a professional contract army or with the addition of a certain form of conscription? How big should the army be? What share of public expenditures should we spend on defense? The biggest or not? And even in the conditions of the future peace? Should private military companies be allowed? Should there be a universal military obligation in Ukraine for all boys and girls, as is the case, for example, in Israel, so that all our people can defend themselves when needed? And should all citizens or a significant part, as is the case in other states, be involved in military training every year? Suppose, while maintaining the salary and job at the time of the training. Are you ready to personally defend Ukraine with weapons in hands? Or do you think it is fair that someone else will fight on the battlefield? These questions of mine are not rhetorical. We really need answers. And it&#x27;s not just something purely functional. About state governance or politics. It&#x27;s about how our people can understand each other and how to stay in Ukraine, because this is our home. Your home. How not to quarrel in it and live developing common interests. For example, people often remain in the rear, but demand from those on the frontline to drive the occupiers all the way to Kuban. It is often the case that a person in the military sphere does not go beyond photographs in camouflage, but at the same time behaves as if he can lead the troops better than anyone else. What is your attitude to such people, for example, in politics? Or in the media? Anyone, it doesn&#x27;t matter. And how should their personal emotions and ambitions relate to reality, to real war? Does a non-combatant have the right to demand something from warriors? Demand meeting some of your requirements and expectations? Is that fair? You probably see that this war can end for Ukraine with certain security guarantees. And in this regard, I have the following question for you: Which countries do you see among the possible guarantors of security for Ukraine? Should we choose those we trust? Or should we focus on everyone who is strong enough? Security guarantees for Ukraine are a really good opportunity to create a tool for decades that will allow us to live in peace. Although it will not allow us to be careless about security. All the same, we will always think about defense. And we must understand that there is no better security than the willingness of citizens to defend their own state. Because it is the protection of oneself first of all - one&#x27;s family, one&#x27;s home, one&#x27;s land, one&#x27;s way of life. This is the state - all this. So, if any of you are not personally ready to defend the state - well, tell me why? Perhaps you see your other contribution to the common national security, which is really special? Maybe it&#x27;s something in the field of cybersecurity. You may want to join some form of volunteering. Perhaps, as future businessmen or scientists - you see for yourself some other option, the third, fourth, fifth. So, my next question to you: Should the state regulate at its discretion who to involve in defense and how, or leave people the choice during the war? Of course, I have my answers to these questions. But Ukraine differs from Russia and other tyrannies with the fact that not one person decides everything for the whole nation, but people can choose the rules of life for themselves. So, the next block of questions. Given that Russia will remain our neighbor, we need to consider the format of security inside Ukraine. The key question is about weapons. Is there a need for the order of possession of firearms by ordinary people that, say, we see in the United States? Or, as in Switzerland, in a society of &quot;citizens with weapons&quot; who can quickly join the defense of their country, and where, for example, a former soldier can keep at home the weapons with which he served. What should be the weapons system? Should it be allowed to carry it openly? Should it be limited to the right to own and keep it at home? Should the rules be the same for all regions of the country or should more liberal ones be provided for those regions where there is a greater threat of invasion? Do you know how to use weapons? How should the border with Russia work after this war? Should it be completely closed or open? In other words, how do you see coexistence with the Russian Federation and its citizens after the war? Could there be what they call the word &quot;relationship&quot; between us and them? Or should it be deliberately restricted, even if it occurs at some level? Let&#x27;s move on. It’s been a long time since I was a student and that&#x27;s understandable. And I think more about which universities my children will study at. Which Ukrainian universities. This is very important. Maybe my daughter, who will soon be 18, will be in an auditorium one of you is currently studying in. But I remember well when I was a student. And I remember that many people of my generation felt a certain loss of time. Years in auditoria, years of lectures... It seemed to many and, I&#x27;m sure, now someone thinks for sure that 5 or 6 years at university is a long time. Probably, if it is a medical specialty, it takes 7 years and a lifetime to study, taking into account all the nuances. But if it is some other specialty, does it always take 5 years? Perhaps 2, 3, 4 are enough for some, given how the modern economy works and how quickly technology is transformed. What do you think about it? And what economic life are you preparing for? Do you anticipate that you will have to change professions during your life? Several times. Or what professions, in your opinion, will always exist and will not be replaced by artificial intelligence and robotics? Maybe it is worth increasing the share of private business in the education system? What do you think about private universities, what do you think about private schools, private education? Can your university&#x27;s curriculum compete with the curricula and courses currently offered in a variety of formats outside of universities? Don&#x27;t you feel like you&#x27;re wasting your time? Because now in the world, even more than before, the main thing is speed. There is such a feeling. Speed in the ability to learn. In everything. At work, in the constant transformation that life demands of the individual. Modern life. I must have been talking for a long time already. Then the last question. Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against Ukraine has been going on for three months already. After 8 years of war in Donbas. This war for us now is undoubtedly a war for independence. We can say that this is a postponed war. Postponed for 30 years, given how we gained independence in 1991. Or for hundreds of years, given the previous history of our great state. I have no doubt that we will gain independence. And it will be in our history the same as in other countries that fought for independence and won. Countries that ceased to be beggars and became subjects. The real masters of their lives and their future. But we must remember now and always that the price of all this is tens of thousands of lives. The lives of all those killed by the enemy. Tens of thousands. For independence. And for the opportunity for each of you to choose how to live and which Ukraine to live in. So, my question to you: Is it worth it? I really hope to hear the answer to this question.</p>

  <h2>Together we must ensure that Russia does not have any success in the aggression against Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>

  <p>Unbreakable people of the bravest country! All our defenders! Today, the 85th day of our defense, will be remembered for sure. I am grateful to the United States for approving a new $ 40 billion package of support for Ukraine and democracy in our region. Today, this package was passed by the US Senate. It is a manifestation of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom. A meeting of finance ministers, heads of G7 central banks and representatives of international donors also took place in Germany. I always say frankly: the monthly budget deficit in Ukraine now is $ 5 billion. And to endure the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support. And it&#x27;s not just expenditures or a gift from partners. This is their contribution to their own security. Because the defense of Ukraine also means their defense from new wars and crises that Russia may provoke. If it succeeds in the war against Ukraine. That is why we must all work together to ensure that there is no success for Russia in its aggression against our state. Neither military, nor economic, nor any other. I spoke today with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. I personally thanked her for the macro-financial assistance in the amount of 9 billion euros, this package was proposed the day before. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On economic issues, in particular on the export of our agricultural products and fuel imports. And also about the situation in the areas of hostilities and the evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. I am doing my best to keep the most influential international forces informed and, as much as possible, involved in rescuing our military. I addressed students of Ukrainian universities. And it was a special address. I hope it will be heard not only by students. Because now is the time when we have the opportunity to build the future for Ukraine that we really want. Our future, Ukrainian future. Without any obsolete and toxic things that have nothing to do with our national needs and our character. Ukraine has become the master of its own life and must decide for itself how to live. In total, students of 25 Ukrainian universities took part in today&#x27;s meeting. Geography is quite wide: Kyiv, Bila Tserkva, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv, Kryvyi Rih, Donetsk, Kherson, Ivano-Frankivsk, Horlivka, Dnipro. Not all universities operate in their cities. Some of them moved. But what was nice and right - students and rectors are confident that Ukraine will win and restore free life throughout the territory. Important current issues were also discussed. Firstly, I instructed the Minister of Education to prepare changes that will allow applicants from all temporarily occupied territories to enter Ukrainian universities under a simplified procedure. Secondly, I instructed the Minister to decide how to ensure the education of those students who study under contract, but come from the currently occupied territories. Obviously, it is extremely difficult to pay for a contract to study in such conditions. The state must help. Therefore, I expect relevant decisions from the Minister, the Government and, if necessary, the people&#x27;s deputies. We talked with students about post-war reconstruction and how to guarantee the security of our state for decades to come. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue the liberation of the Kharkiv region. But in Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure. There&#x27;s hell, and that&#x27;s not an exaggeration. The brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk... 12 dead and dozens wounded in just one day. The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army - all this is not just hostilities during the war. Russian strikes at the Chernihiv region, in particular the terrible strike at Desna, debris clearance continues, many dead; constant strikes at the Odesa region, at the cities of central Ukraine, Donbas is completely destroyed - all this doesn’t and cannot have any military explanation for Russia. This is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible. Destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible. This is what will be qualified as the genocide of the Ukrainian people and for which the occupiers will definitely be brought to justice. The first trial in Ukraine against a Russian war criminal has already begun. And it will end with the full restoration of justice within the international tribunal. I&#x27;m sure of it. We will find and bring to justice all those who give and carry out criminal orders. Today I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 210 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 48 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was posthumously awarded to Captain Serhiy Parkhomenko, commander of the aviation unit of the 299th tactical aviation brigade. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who is fighting for independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We urge the partner states to recognize that Russia must be held financially responsible for the crimes it committed - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-20</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! But also our partners in the world. Today my appeal is broader than usual. And this address is dedicated to the subject on which we will work together in the near future. Namely, compensation for all the losses that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine through its aggression. Please take a look at how this day has passed. Missile strike of the Russian army at the Kharkiv region. In the town of Lozova, the occupiers destroyed a house of culture. Of course, Russia has already done everything possible to ensure that there is no place left for culture on its territory. But what does our Kharkiv region have to do with it? Let them undermine what is left of their houses of culture in Russia, if they want to. The invaders also hit the Odesa region, Poltava region, Zhytomyr region. Attempts to attack Donbas continue. They completely ruined Rubizhne, Volnovakha, just as Mariupol. They are trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities. They do everything to erode any normal life in the Kherson region, in those areas of the Zaporizhzhia region where they entered. All this and much more that the Russian army has done since February 24 and since 2014 needs a fair response. First of all, liberation. We must fight until we clear our land of the occupiers and guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s security. Secondly, it is the prosecution of all Russian war criminals. In the Ukrainian courts, in the international tribunal and just on the battlefield while the war continues. But, thirdly, we are working to ensure that Russia compensates in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise. Every shut down business, every hryvnia lost by people, enterprises, communities and the state. Russian money as compensation should reach every affected person, family, business. Of course, the Russian state will not even recognize that it is an aggressor. But its recognition is not required. We urge our partner countries to legally recognize that Russia must be held financially responsible for the crimes it committed. This is important not only in the context of this war waged by Russia. But also in the context of any other aggressive actions, whether by Russia or any other potential aggressor. Evil must get a retribution and know that it will be punished. Therefore, we invite the partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism through which each and every one who has suffered from Russia&#x27;s actions will be able to receive compensation for all losses. Under such an agreement, Russian funds and property under the jurisdiction of partner countries must be seized or frozen, and then confiscated and directed to a specially created fund from which all victims of Russian aggression can receive appropriate compensation. That would be fair. And Russia will feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every projectile it has fired at us. We invite our partners to become the founders of such a fund, as well as members of a special international commission that will consider lawsuits, i.e. appeals from both individuals and legal entities. It is clear that this task will not be easy. But in fact, the debate has begun about the need for such compensation at the cost of Russian assets. The world is already talking about it. So we have to do it. And we are starting such a special dialogue with our partners. To make the aggressor feel that the war is capable of inflicting maximum damage not on anyone else, but on the one who went with it to a neighbor. The world has seen that existing international organizations and instruments cannot cope with all the challenges. Therefore, it is necessary not only to use the opportunities that already exist, but also to offer new ones. It will be effective. I also spoke today about Russia&#x27;s responsibility for this war with representatives of Ireland who visited Ukraine. The Chairpersons of both Houses of the Irish Parliament were in the capital. We had very meaningful talks with them. And one more thing. Today I definitely want to thank our people who do not stop fighting the occupation. And especially those who are now in the territory that is temporarily under the control of Russia, its army. In particular, the rescuers in Enerhodar who protested today deserve support from all of us. Thank you. Each and every one must show that the occupiers have no right to decide anything on our land. This is an important component of our victory. Another decree on awarding our defenders was signed today. 202 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. In total, during the full-scale war, more than 14,000 of our defenders have already been awarded for bravery and efficiency in defending the country and helping our people. Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine! And definitely the last one. Today is three years since I became President of Ukraine. Thank you for your trust. I am proud to be the President. Love you! I will not let you down! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The war continues, and each of us must take care of the defense every day - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-21</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! This day in our state has a double meaning. This is Science Day. And Europe Day. I congratulate our scientists, who, despite all the difficulties, nevertheless work to ensure that Ukraine preserves and develops its scientific potential. Of course, during a full-scale war, all the forces of society and the state can be aimed only at protection. And these are significant limitations for science, for the cultural sphere, for other fundamental parts of public life. But such is the time we live in. We are doing everything we can to return to the rules of peacetime as soon as possible. I would also like to express my gratitude to all those who are working to make Ukraine a part of a united Europe. To all our diplomats, to all our civil servants who now have a few weeks to complete the task that other countries have been overcoming for years when joining the European Union. And I want to emphasize that our European integration path is not just about politics. It&#x27;s about quality of life. And about the fact that Ukrainians perceive the values of life in the same way as the vast majority of Europeans. I held talks with the Prime Minister of Portugal in Kyiv today. I thanked him for all the support that Portugal is currently providing to Ukraine. This is defense, political and humanitarian support. I am grateful for the warm treatment of our people who have taken refuge in Portugal. Further sanctions against the Russian Federation were discussed with the Prime Minister. And also - post-war reconstruction of our state. Portugal is ready to join the reconstruction of Ukraine, the reconstruction of Ukrainian schools and kindergartens. And I want to remind you that during the full-scale war, the Russian army has already destroyed 1873 educational institutions. This is a colossal scale of losses. But when a united Europe, American leadership and the whole free world stand with you, you can overcome that as well. I am grateful to President Biden for the immediate signing of the $ 40 billion support package for Ukraine approved by the US Congress. This is a historic contribution to the protection of freedom in Europe. I also spoke today with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. The main focus was on the situation on the battlefield and how Ukraine&#x27;s victory can be brought closer. We agreed that the sixth package of sanctions against Russia should be accelerated. I am grateful for Italy&#x27;s full support on our path to the European Union. The military situation has not changed significantly today. But it was really hard. Actually, the fact that we are able to say this on the 87th day of a full-scale war against Russia is good news. Russia has sent virtually all its resources to destroy us. In the Russian regions, it is openly said that their so-called &quot;special operation&quot; is the cause of the economic downturn - in particular, in the industries such as construction and many others. And also the reason for the impoverishment of people, which may be even greater than in the 1990s. Rising prices, devaluation of income, destruction of all the economic potential that has been created in Russia since the 2000s - all this does not stop the invaders yet. But the colossal costs of the war still do not help them. And will not help. The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. As in previous days, the Russian army is trying to attack Slovyansk and Severodonetsk. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring this offensive. Every day that our defenders take away from these offensive plans of Russia, disrupting them, is a concrete contribution to the approach of the main day. The desired day that we are all looking forward to and fighting for. Victory Day. And no Russian strikes - neither by missiles in the Rivne region, nor by artillery in the Kharkiv or Sumy region, nor by all possible weapons in Donbas - will give Russia any result. Today I signed a decree on awarding our heroes. 215 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 30 of them posthumously. Almost every day I have such decrees on my desk. On awarding our defenders. On conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine. And this reflects the severity of the military situation. Unfortunately, the war continues. The war is not over. We still need to fight and move towards victory. Maybe someone in the rear cities thinks that one can forget about the war. And become carefree. Or even careless. It isn’t so. Every day Ukrainians die for our independence. Every day! And each and every one of us must take care of our defense on a daily basis. With anything they can. In a way they can. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave lives for our state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the joint participation with President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda in the plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Chairman, presidium. Dear people&#x27;s deputies of Ukraine, Dear guests. Andrzej. Ladies and Gentlemen! Guest in the house, God in the house. This is a Polish proverb with which I greet in Kyiv our guest, friend and brother, President of Poland Andrzej Duda. This folk wisdom tells that each of your guests is a grace of God. And this is the worldview according to which the Poles from the very beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine, sheltered millions of our citizens - citizens of Ukraine. Our women, our children, the elderly and everyone else whose door was knocked on on February 24 by completely different guests. Guests whom we never wanted to have and who have other proverbs and other folk wisdom. Russia has been proving this &quot;otherness&quot; for 88 days. 88 days of madness: their missiles, bombs, projectiles fly into houses, schools, hospitals, museums, theaters, temples, even cemeteries. At the same time, without realizing it, on February 24, Russia destroyed something else as well. A kind of &quot;repository&quot; of past contradictions between Ukraine and Poland. They no longer exist. In a day it became clear that all these contradictions have no force when there is the force of such a threat. Threat to the survival of our nations - Ukraine, Poland, the nations of Europe. Andrzej and I sought a true understanding between our nations, and together we dismantled this &quot;repository.&quot; We planned to build a Memorial of Reconciliation on the common border of Ukraine and Poland. But those who want other memorials, dedicated not to peace at all, have crossed Ukrainian borders. February 24 changed everything. It changed our nations. Changed our countries. Although this is not accidental. I do not know whether our astronomers Drohobych and Copernicus studied this phenomenon, but the stars are always formed in such a way that during the most difficult periods of eclipse Ukrainians and Poles unite and stand side by side, despite past quarrels and &quot;nebulae&quot;. We are defending a common universe for us called freedom and independence, at a time when someone is committing barbarism of a cosmic scale. Today the understanding, interaction, friendship and brotherhood of Ukraine and Poland reach the same scale. On February 24, we began writing a new volume of our history. Our common history - it is important. The unity of our nations must last forever. It must never again be dishonored by enmity. St. John Paul II called the incitement of hatred between us a blatant anachronism unworthy of our two great nations. In various letters to our nations, the Pontiff said: “The new millennium requires that Ukrainians and Poles not remain enslaved by sad memories of the past. By committing to a better future for all, let them look at each other with a look of reconciliation. Our two nations have experienced so much bitterness and pain over the past few decades. Let this experience serve as purification. Let everyone be willing to put what unites above what divides. Look for something that cures. So that together they may build a future based on mutual respect, brotherhood, fraternal cooperation and true solidarity.&quot; Learn to appreciate, distinguish, choose. Ukraine and Poland have chosen one path. This path. On it we learned to distinguish enemies and appreciate friends. Appreciate each other and most importantly - respect. The time that Jerzy Giedroyc and Bohdan Osadchuk dreamed of has come. About which Juliusz Słowacki, whose monument stands in Kyiv, and Taras Shevchenko, whose monument stands in Warsaw, wrote. Today, half a word is enough for Polish President Andrzej and I to understand each other. Our parliaments, our governments and our nations in general understand each other as never before. And it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it is Cyrillic or Latin, it doesn&#x27;t matter how we write the words &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;independence&quot;. It is important that Ukrainians and Poles say these things in the same way. And are equally ready to defend them. Ukraine is already doing this. On the very frontline. It defends not just itself but the whole of Europe. Poles know this, appreciate, respect and help Ukraine - not out of courtesy, but as brothers and allies who remember Lech Kaczyński&#x27;s words about who could be next. This does not mean fear. This means readiness to face the enemy and repel him. That is why, for example, we have the same perception of the sanctions policy against the Russian Federation. We know that half-measures cannot be used when aggression needs to be stopped. Now. Poland is one of the leaders not only in supporting our state, but also in defending and promoting the sanctions that are absolutely necessary to force Russia into peace. The absolute majority of Poles support the embargo on energy resources from Russia. This is just one manifestation - but how important it is - of our common vision of the political front in this war. I believe that Poland&#x27;s leadership will help establish at the European level what our nations already understand. The unity of our nations must remain constant. Neither now nor in the future does anyone have the right to break this unity. Neither our politicians, nor hostile agents, nor even members of the jury at Eurovision. The Ukrainian and Polish nations gave each other 12 points - today and forever. I want to thank all Poles for their support. I want to remember everyone from this rostrum. So that every voivodeship, powiat and gmina hears this. Whose support and help is felt in every region, every city, village, in every community of Ukraine. Thank you, Warsaw, Kraków. Thank you, Łódź, Poznań, Wrocław. Thank you Gdańsk, Bydgoszcz, Toruń. Thank you, Lublin, Katowice, Opole, Szczecin. Gorzów Wielkopolski, Zielona Góra. Thank you, Rzeszów, Białystok, Olsztyn, Kielce. These are sister cities of our cities - Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Kremenchuk, Kryvyi Rih, Cherkasy, Luhansk, Donetsk, Sumy, Izyum, Starobilsk, Mariupol. Almost all our cities are sister cities of those in Poland. Our nations are also brothers. Our countries are sisters. We are relatives. And there should be no borders or barriers between us. The Ukrainian and Polish nations have not been mentally separated for a long time. So we agreed to implement this in the near future in the relevant bilateral agreement. First on joint border and customs control, and later on the conditional border when Ukraine becomes a member of the European Union. And I am sure that all the necessary decisions will be made first for the status of a candidate for Ukraine, and then for full membership. In particular, thanks to Poland&#x27;s many years of protection of Ukrainian interests on the European continent. And I am grateful for your willingness - for your willingness personally, Andrzej - to pay a visit to European capitals together with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová to lobby for Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union in countries - as they say, &quot;skeptics&quot;. In fact, they are not skeptics, but future optimists. This is how I see our common very important task in this direction. Separately, I thank the Polish Sejm for the recently adopted law on assistance to the citizens of Ukraine. This is a completely unprecedented decision, according to which our citizens, who were forced to move temporarily to Poland due to the aggression of the Russian Federation, will receive almost the same rights and opportunities as Polish citizens. Legal residence, employment, education, medical care, social guarantees. This is a great step, a great gesture of a great soul, which only a great friend of Ukraine is capable of. And this step will not remain unilateral. I believe that in the near future we must submit to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a similar - mirror - bill. God forbid that Polish citizens will ever need all these advantages in such conditions, in conditions of war. But these laws are of great symbolic significance. They show that Ukrainians and Poles are native and equal. And I am sure that the parliamentary corps of Ukraine will support this law - quickly and, I am sure, by a majority of votes. In addition, before this speech, I signed a decree noting the special role of the Polish city of Rzeszów. I have introduced a special honorary title of &quot;rescuer city&quot; for the partner cities of our state, which today do the impossible to help us, to help our people, to help our army. On behalf of the entire Ukrainian people, I would like to express great gratitude to the city of Rzeszów, the first rescuer city. I also want to thank Polish cultural figures, sportsmen, clergy and ordinary people who support us - organize big concerts, take part in competitions with the Ukrainian ribbon, or come from Poznań to Bucha just to bake bread. I believe that soon Ukrainians and Poles will gather at one big table to share this bread. Share the feelings - the most important feelings - of peace. Share the taste of victory. Victory of Ukraine. Joint victory. And raise a toast to your and our freedom. Without a free Ukraine, there can be no free Poland. I know historians often argue about who was the first to say this, who was the author of this phrase. We have resolved this dispute - this is the will of the Ukrainian and Polish nations. Thank you brothers! Together until the end. Niech żyje Polska! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine expands its international ties every week to get everything it needs to end the war as soon as possible - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-22</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today was a real Polish day. I was glad to welcome the President of our fraternal Poland and my friend Andrzej Duda in Kyiv. First, on May 3, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson addressed our Verkhovna Rada online. And today - already personally - there was the President of Poland. And, by the way, this line of cooperation - Ukraine - Poland, Ukraine - Britain was really very effective and remains so during this war. I am glad to note that Ukrainian-Polish relations are finally on a completely clean, sincere basis, without any quarrels and old conflict heritage. This is an achievement. The historical achievement of our nations. And I want the brotherhood between Ukrainians and Poles to be preserved forever. As I said about this today to the deputies: for our unity, the unity of Ukrainians and Poles, to be a constant value that no one will violate. I signed a decree on the introduction of a new award of Ukraine - to thank those cities of partner countries that have helped the most. And Rzeszów became the first such city. The rescuer city. Quite rightly. Another decision I announced today is the preparation of a bill that will be a mirror image of the law on our citizens, Ukrainians, passed in Poland. What is this law? Ukrainian men and women temporarily staying in Poland fleeing the war have de facto and de jure been given the same opportunities as Poles. And it will be the right gesture to pass such a law in Ukraine. Let it be so that the citizens of Poland will never have to use such a law. But let us show our gratitude and our respect. And I also want it to be part of our new neighborhood policy. We must resolve disputes and remove the pressure of the past from our current relations with all Ukraine&#x27;s neighbors who respect us and are not occupiers of our state. A decision has been reached that is revolutionizing the order on our border. We are introducing joint customs control with Poland. This will significantly speed up border procedures. It will remove most of the corruption risks. But it is also the beginning of our integration into the common customs space of the European Union. That is a truly historical process. Of course, Andrzej and I also talked today about the defense support for Ukraine. And about strengthening sanctions against Russia. And about the steps we need to take to achieve our common goal - full membership of Ukraine in the EU. I am grateful to Andrzej and all the Polish people for the fact that we are going along this path as quickly as possible. In the evening I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I told Boris about our meeting, about the negotiations, about the situation on the battlefield. We are looking for ways to increase the volume of our exports, especially agricultural products. As well as the volume of fuel imports to Ukraine. I am preparing to start a new week of maximum diplomatic activity in the interests of our state. On Monday I will join the discussions at the Davos Forum. This is the world&#x27;s most influential economic platform where Ukraine has something to say. There will be other public speeches during the week, including an address to the Stanford University community. As well as a special format of communication with the political and expert communities of Indonesia. Of course, the schedule also includes a large number of contacts at the bilateral level with representatives of various states and international organizations. Our state expands its international ties every week to get everything it needs to end the war as soon as possible. There will be a new meeting of representatives of the partner countries - &quot;Ramstein-2&quot;, if we call this group after the place of the first meeting in Germany. We look forward to new useful decisions for our defense. I signed a decree on awarding our military. 194 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 44 of them posthumously. Everyone should always remember these people. Those who give their lives for Ukraine. So that all generations of our people can live freely and choose independently with whom to be friends, whom to respect and what values to pass on to their children. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to each and every one whose lives were taken by the Russian invaders. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We should not be afraid to set new precedents - speech by the President of Ukraine at the World Economic Forum in Davos</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-23</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. Executive Chairman, Professor Schwab, Dear President Cassis, Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear attendees! I am grateful for this opportunity to take part in the discussion at the Forum. The general theme of Davos this year is: History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies. And this year the words &quot;turning point&quot; are not just a rhetorical figure. This is really the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world. If it reigns, our thoughts won’t matter to it. And we may no longer convene in Davos. Because what for? Brute force seeks nothing but the subjugation of those it wants to subdue. And it does not discuss, but kills at once, as Russia is doing in Ukraine right now, right at this time when we are talking. By the way, please look at the building of the former Russian House in Davos. It has been turned into a house of Russian war crimes. And this is an example of their transformation. What Russia has done to itself by becoming a state of war crimes. And what it brings to the world. Inspiring other potential aggressors. Instead of successful peaceful cities - black ruins. Instead of normal trade - mined sea and blocked ports in Ukraine. Instead of tourism - closed skies and thousands of Russian bombs and cruise missiles. This is what the world will look like if humanity misses this turning point. It will look like a very large collection of war crimes. So, history remembers many moments when everything changed dramatically. It remembers, for example, how just a few shots can lead to millions of casualties. If these were the shots on June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo. History remembers how much grief one person’s evil can cause if he sees that he is not being resisted enough. As it was, for example, in 1938 in Munich. Historical twists were noticeable and not as much. But it was always necessary to react to them. Trying to prepare for other historical upheavals - as they say, to soften the blow. Or - trying to heal the wounds of catastrophes that were behind one or another historical turn. And now we have a large collection of such reactions: the UN Charter with all units of the Organization, the OSCE, the IAEA, the WTO and many, many other important institutions. But are they enough to respond to what we are facing today? And is it enough now to try to adapt those institutions to modern challenges? Definitely not. We need to change the approach. Not to react, but to act. And act preventively. And not only to adapt what we have to the new realities, but also to create new tools. New precedents. Look at what Ukraine has already done. We have set a historical precedent for courage. Without listening to those who said that our defense would not last longer than a few days. We have stopped the Russian army, which was called the second in the world, and at the cost of heavy fighting and thousands of lives, we are gradually driving the occupiers out of our land. But would we have to do that if we had been listened to last year and if the full range of sanctions that can knock down any aggressor had been applied fairly and preventively against the Russian Federation? I&#x27;m sure the answer is “no”. Preventing war would be guaranteed if the world&#x27;s actions had been preventive rather than responsive. Ukraine has set another precedent in these three months. A precedent for the unprecedented unity of the democratic world around the emotion of genuine admiration for Ukrainian courage and around the understanding that freedom must be fought for. And now hundreds of millions of people in democracies are putting pressure, supporting and putting pressure on the governments and companies to limit relations with the aggressor state, Russia, and to help the people they have attacked. But this is happening only now, although Russia started a war against Ukraine in 2014. We are grateful for such support, but if it had happened then - immediately - this unity and this pressure on governments, on companies for the struggle for freedom, would Russia have started this full-scale war and inflicted all these losses to Ukraine and the world? I am sure that the answer to this question is “no” as well. Now we see that the world listens and believes Ukraine. But there is also a certain expectation in the world how this situation will be resolved. What tools will work? What new can we create to prevent such aggressions? And how do we stop the brute force that has challenged everything we really value? That&#x27;s what a turning point means. Ladies and Gentlemen! Don&#x27;t wait for the fatal strikes. Don&#x27;t wait until Russia uses special weapons - chemical, biological and, God forbid, nuclear. Do not give the aggressor the impression that the world will not show enough resistance. Protect freedom and normal, useful for all peaceful order in the world immediately and in full! That&#x27;s what sanctions should be. Maximum. So that Russia and every other potential aggressor who wants to wage a brutal war against a neighbor knows exactly what this is leading to. And I think there are no such sanctions against Russia yet. And they must be imposed. Russian oil embargo. Complete blocking of all banks without exception - all. Complete abandonment of the Russian IT sector. Complete cessation of trade with the aggressor. This should be a precedent of sanctions pressure that will work convincingly for decades to maintain peace. It is necessary to set a precedent for the complete exit of all foreign businesses from the Russian market. So that your brands are not associated with war crimes. That your offices, accounts, commodities are not used by war criminals in their bloody interests. Values must matter. Especially since everyone suffers losses when a full-scale war begins and global markets are destabilized due to someone’s neglect of values. For our part, we offer every company that leaves the Russian market to continue operating in Ukraine. You will get access not only to our market of 40 million consumers, but also to the common market of Europe. And at the same time - your brands, positions will only be enhanced due to the fact that you really support the protection of freedom. Our representatives here in Davos can inform each and every one of you about the details of the prospects that Ukraine opens for businesses. Ladies and Gentlemen! We offer the world to set a precedent for rebuilding the country after the war, which will show everyone who dreams of destroying the life of a neighbor that the war doesn’t bring the expected result. I invite you to take part in this reconstruction. The amount of work is enormous. We have more than half a trillion dollars in losses. Tens of thousands of objects were destroyed. We need to rebuild entire cities, entire industries. And we offer a special - historically significant - model of reconstruction. When each of the partner countries or partner cities or partner companies will have the opportunity - historical one - to take patronage over a particular region of Ukraine, city, community or industry. Britain, Denmark, the European Union and other leading international actors have already chosen a specific direction for patronage in reconstruction. Thanks to this model of relations, post-war reconstruction can be fast, efficient and high-quality. And this will not only attract the world&#x27;s best specialists - architects, engineers, builders, developers, managers and others. It will also be the largest opportunity for economic leap in Europe since World War II. And I hope that by the beginning of the international conference in Lugano in July this year dedicated to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, which Mr. Cassis spoke about, all our partner countries and most of the world&#x27;s leading companies will have formed their own packages of proposals. By the way, given the presence of President Cassis today, I would like to thank Switzerland for organizing this Conference in Lugano and supporting our efforts. I would also like to note the efforts of Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, in particular the proposal to create a Reconstruction Platform, which will be managed jointly by Ukraine and the European Commission and will direct European Union resources to restore normal life in our country. However the list of new precedents needed will not be complete without a few more important decisions. There must be a precedent of punishment for the aggressor and investment in a peaceful life. Russian assets scattered in different jurisdictions must be found, arrested or frozen, and then confiscated and sent to a special Fund from which all victims of this war can receive compensation. Of course, this is not easy. But after that, there will be no motivation left for the various aggressors to do what Russia has done and continues to do. If the aggressor loses everything, it definitely deprives him of motivation to start a war. Let&#x27;s move on. Any response to the mass famine is overdue by definition. The famine should be stopped only preventively - when it has not yet begun. But now there is no such tool in the world. We propose to create an organization of responsible and democratic food-exporting states that can act with respect for human rights and global trade rules. Our motivation is very simple. Whatever the turning points in history, humanity must have insurance against famine. And Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for the activities of such a new organization - a definitely needed one. And the last point. You know, this war of Russia against Ukraine convinces everyone that aid to the attacked state is more valuable the sooner it is provided. Weapons, finances, political support, sanctions against Russia - if we had received them one hundred percent of our needs in February, the result would be tens of thousands of lives saved. That is why Ukraine needs all the weapons we ask for, not just the ones we are given. That is why Ukraine needs finances. That&#x27;s at least $ 5 billion a month. And all the funds needed for reconstruction. That is why the United24 Ukraine Recovery Fund was established. And we encourage you to join the support using this platform. Ukrainian state platform. For each donor, we give a specific proposal - how to help and where to send funds. Where the priority is now. The target nature of the work is an absolute priority. And in the future, under this brand, United24, we propose to create a global structure that can provide sufficient support within 24 hours for any country that has suffered a military attack, natural disaster or, for example, a pandemic. That is, we offer a new format of security guarantees. Based on what we went through. What we are going through now. There must be something that sets a precedent of absolutely timely assistance. To everyone who needs it. To preserve peace, to preserve life, to preserve social stability. That is, all the necessary elements for a normal economy. Like, for example, the 911 service, there must be a United24 that guarantees security on a global scale. Ladies and Gentlemen! George Marshall, a well-remembered man, said in 1947: &quot;Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.&quot; These words are still relevant today. My proposals are directed in the same way - against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. And of course against the war unleashed by Russia, which brings nothing but hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. To many in the world. Not just us. Therefore, in order to guarantee peace and tranquility, we must all act quickly and preventively. We must not be afraid to set new precedents. This is exactly what the world has long had to learn at various turning points, for which it paid a high price. This was the price for the fact that the world only reacted, not acted preventively. So, now we can do it differently. Finally in the right way. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The coming weeks of the war will be difficult, yet we have no alternative but to fight and win - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-23</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Every day, addressing our people, I emphasize how difficult and at what cost it is to defend against Russian aggression. The occupiers are waging a very brutal war against us. Indeed, there has been no such war on the European continent for 77 years. Total war. When the enemy tries to destroy as many people and infrastructure as possible. The clearance of debris in Desna in the Chernihiv region has been completed. 87 dead. And these were only four missiles. In total, since February 24, the Russian army has launched 1,474 missile strikes at Ukraine, using 2,275 different missiles. The vast majority was aimed at civilian objects. In less than three months, there have been more than 3,000 air strikes by Russian aircraft and helicopters. What other country has withstood such a scale of strikes? Every time we tell our partners that we need modern anti-missile weapons, modern combat aircraft, we are not just making a formal request. We say that our request is the real lives of many people who would not have died if we had received all the weapons we are asking for. By the way, today, talking to the participants of the Davos Forum, which began its work, I spoke in particular about this. About the need to provide Ukraine with everything it needs to save the lives of our people. All our partners agree that Ukraine&#x27;s struggle in the war against Russia is the protection of the common values of all countries in the free world. Our common freedom. And if so, then we have the right to count on full and urgent assistance, especially weapons. My every international negotiations, every address to parliaments or other foreign audiences is necessarily related to this topic. And I am grateful to all those partners who help and provide us with the necessary weapons and ammunition to overcome the advantage of the Russian army, especially in the amount of equipment and weapons. The most difficult fighting situation today is in Donbas. Bakhmut, Popasna, Severodonetsk - in this direction the occupiers have concentrated the greatest activity so far. They organized a massacre there and are trying to destroy everything living there. Literally. Nobody destroyed Donbas as much as the Russian army does now. And I am grateful to all our warriors who are holding their positions and have the courage to counterattack. Today in Kyiv, at the Mariyinsky Palace in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine, I presented the Orders of the Golden Star. To the warriors, as well as to the relatives of those of our Heroes who were posthumously awarded. In particular, to the sister of sailor Vitaliy Skakun. He was a sapper of the 137th Separate Marine Battalion of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrogradsky. He died performing a combat mission in southern Ukraine. Thanks to his courage and heroism, we managed to significantly delay the offensive of the overwhelming forces of the enemy and save hundreds of lives of our soldiers. In this war - both from February 24 and from 2014 - the Marines proved their extraordinary bravery. They were among those units that heroically defended Mariupol. They took part in many important battles. And today - on the Day of the Marines - I express my sincere gratitude to all those who defend the state in these troops. The Russian occupiers are trying very hard to show that they allegedly will not give up the occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, the Kherson region, the occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhia region and Donbas. They are going on the offensive in some areas. Reserves are being accumulated in some areas. Somewhere they are trying to reinforce their positions. The coming weeks of the war will be difficult. And we must be aware of that. Yet we have no alternative but to fight. Fight and win. Free our land and our people. Because the occupiers want to take away from us not just something, but everything we have. Including the right to life for Ukrainians. However, to win, each and every one of us must work for it. And including those in the rear. Help the army. Protect the needs of our state in all international platforms to which you have access, in communication with foreign journalists, even just with your friends and acquaintances abroad. Every vote counts. Today, as every day, I worked to increase the pressure on Russia. Our representatives in Davos are working to give Ukraine more financial and humanitarian support. And for all diplomats of our state the absolute priority is weapons and ammunition for our state. In the evening I signed a decree on awarding our warriors. 161 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 42 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who are bringing our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The supply of weapons to Ukraine is the best investment in maintaining stability in the world - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-24</span></div>
  <p>Strong people of our bravest country! All our defenders! The third month of our defense is over. This is a long time. A term not foreseen by the world&#x27;s leading intelligence agencies. This was not even assumed by our enemies. And this is what motivates the world to look at our land, Ukraine, in a completely different way. This is three months of war crimes of the Russian occupiers. Three months of their strikes, destruction, blockade. And three months of mass exploits of our people who are defending their own land, their own country. 15,227 Ukrainian men and women were awarded state awards. 12,550 of them are servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 1801 warriors of the National Guard. 205 border guards. 182 police officers. 167 employees of the Security Service of Ukraine. 138 representatives of the State Emergency Service. 99 representatives of the Main Intelligence Directorate. 38 employees of the State Special Communications Service. And also - employees of the Department of State Protection, the Foreign Intelligence Service, NABU, SBI and the Judicial Protection Service, who also contributed to our defense. 155 Ukrainians were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine, 75 of them posthumously. 1016 settlements of Ukraine have already been de-occupied. And each of these figures is a story. A story of extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice. This is the heroic defense of Mariupol. These are stories of success in the battles for Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv. This is a heroic defense in Donbas. This is the defense of Odesa, Mykolaiv and our entire south. These are protests and resistance in those cities and communities of Ukraine that we have yet to liberate. We must always remember that we have survived these three months thanks to the tens of thousands of feats of all those who defend the state. And at the cost of tens of thousands of lives of Ukrainian men and women killed by the occupiers. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Another completely inadequate statement was made from Russia today that they were allegedly &quot;slowing down&quot; the offensive on purpose. Well, after three months of searching for an explanation why they failed to break Ukraine in three days, they came up with nothing better than to claim that they had allegedly planned to do so. Almost 30,000 Russian soldiers killed. More than 200 downed aircraft. Thousands of lost Russian tanks, armored vehicles and other equipment. Russian missile ammunition is almost completely used up. And they want to cover it up with lies that they are not fighting at full strength? Miserably. And the time will come when they themselves will admit it. Now the situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. In fact, all the strength the Russian army still has was thrown there to attack. Lyman, Popasna, Severodonetsk, Slovyansk - the occupiers want to destroy everything there. But in the interceptions of their conversations, we hear that they are well aware that this war does not make sense for Russia and that strategically their army stands no chance. But it takes time and still a lot of extraordinary efforts by our people to break their advantage in the amount of equipment and weapons. I am grateful to all the partners of Ukraine who help. But I emphasize again and again: the longer this war lasts, the greater will be the price of protecting freedom not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole free world. Therefore, the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine - MLRS, tanks, anti-ship and other weapons - is the best investment in maintaining stability in the world and preventing many severe crises that Russia is still planning or has already provoked. We continue to work to ensure that Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees after this war. In particular, an international advisory group headed by Yermak and former NATO Secretary General Rasmussen has been set up. The group will include leading experts in the fields of security and defense, diplomacy. Their task is to develop a format of guarantees that will really work. And not for several months or years, but during the lifetime of many generations of our Ukrainians. I spoke today with President of the European Council Charles Michel. At the end of May, an important meeting of the European Council will be held on assistance to Ukraine. So we coordinated our positions. In particular, on strengthening sanctions on Russia. I also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. First of all, about the defense support for Ukraine. About further political cooperation and providing our state with all the assistance, including financial, which is so necessary to beat the occupiers. I held a meeting with the leaders of the Crimean direction of our policy. In particular, with Tamila Tasheva, Permanent Representative of the President of Ukraine to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The Russian invasion began in Crimea. This was not the first item on the list of mistakes of the Russian state towards Ukraine, but the first fateful one for Russia itself. It is from this point that the following, no less fateful mistakes of Russia came, which all together will lead to its historical weakening. And, of course, the occupiers will have to leave Crimea, too. As well as Kherson, Melitopol, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all other cities and communities where they still pretend to be the masters. They will definitely not be the masters there. I am grateful to each and everyone who helps bring this time of liberation of our territory and peace closer. I am grateful to all our military, intelligence officers, border guards, sappers, rescuers, doctors, nurses, police officers, National Guard, communications service employees, diplomats, volunteers, journalists, all transport workers, Ukrzaliznytsia, workers of the energy sector. To everyone who provides logistics. To everyone who organizes the evacuation. To everyone who restores life in the liberated territory. To everyone who continues to teach pupils, to teach students. To everyone who keeps business and, consequently, jobs for our citizens. To everyone who works, saves, helps and promotes Ukrainian interests in the world. I am grateful to everyone who decided to be with Ukraine on February 24. We will definitely win! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Those who advise Ukraine to give away territory to Russia do not want to see ordinary Ukrainians living there - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-25</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! I started this day by talking to the participants of the Ukrainian Breakfast, which took place within the Davos Forum. I want to say something about why I take part in such events, and what others are saying, particularly in Davos this year. The world turned out not to be ready for Ukrainian bravery. For the bravery of all our people who are not inferior to Russia and continue to defend our state. Remember how it all began on February 24, when many in the world did not even believe that Ukraine would be able to withstand a full-scale war. Was that so? It was. And why was that so? Not because all these people who doubted were equally mistaken when assessing the potential of our state. But because many of them did not even begin to assess. Many of them simply did not want to take Ukraine into account. There was no such habit - to take Ukraine into account. Although they have a habit of taking Russia into account. Even when there are no objective reasons for this. It is convenient for them. And really habitual. Often very profitable. Calling certain Russian politicians &quot;Dostoevsky&#x27;s heroes&quot;, as if it serves as an excuse for them. Talking about the alleged historical sphere of influence of Russia. And about the alleged balance in relations in Europe, which is allegedly impossible without Russia. No matter what the Russian state does, there is always someone who says: let&#x27;s take its interests into account. This year in Davos it was heard again. Despite thousands of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Despite tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed. Despite Bucha and Mariupol, etc. Despite the destroyed cities. And despite the &quot;filtration camps&quot; built by the Russian state, in which they kill, torture, rape and humiliate like on a conveyor belt. Russia has done all this in Europe. But still in Davos, for example, Mr. Kissinger emerges from the deep past and says that a piece of Ukraine should be given to Russia. So that there is no alienation of Russia from Europe. It seems that Mr. Kissinger&#x27;s calendar is not 2022, but 1938, and he thought he was talking to an audience not in Davos, but in Munich of that time. By the way, in the real year 1938, when Mr. Kissinger&#x27;s family was fleeing Nazi Germany, he was 15 years old, and he understood everything perfectly. And nobody heard from him then that it was necessary to adapt to the Nazis instead of fleeing them or fighting them. Symptomatic editorials began to appear in some Western media stating that Ukraine must allegedly accept so-called difficult compromises by giving up territory in exchange for peace. Perhaps The New York Times in 1938 also wrote something similar. But now, let me remind you, it is 2022. And behind all these geopolitical speculations of those who advise Ukraine to give away something to Russia, &quot;great geopoliticians&quot; are always unwilling to see ordinary people. Ordinary Ukrainians. Millions of those who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace. You must always see people. And remember that values are not just a word. That is why I pay such attention to international platforms, addresses to parliamentarians, to parliaments, to the people of other countries, to communication with the expert community, with journalists, with students. We must do everything possible for the world to get a permanent habit of taking Ukraine into account. So that the interests of Ukrainians are not overlapped by the interests of those who are in a hurry for another meeting with the dictator. That&#x27;s why I always have a lot of international communication in my schedule. Yesterday and today - Davos. Tomorrow - the Parliament of Latvia. The day after tomorrow - Stanford and Indonesia. Then - just as actively. I spoke with Austrian Chancellor Nehammer. I informed him about the situation in Donbas and other areas of hostilities. Expressed gratitude for the support. We agreed that Austria would take our severely wounded servicemen for treatment. Cooperation in the European integration of Ukraine was discussed in detail. I also spoke with the President of Liberia today. The main topic of conversation was the counteraction to the food crisis provoked by the Russian Federation. Expressed gratitude for the support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity, in particular at the UN platform. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and all those who defend the state are resisting the extremely fierce offensive of Russian troops in the east. In some areas, the enemy is substantially superior in terms of equipment, number of soldiers. The Russian authorities have made an illustrative decision - they have allowed to hire older people for contract service. That is, they no longer have enough young people, but the desire to fight still remains. It still takes time to discourage them from this. We still need the help of partners, especially weapons for Ukraine. Total help! No exceptions, no restrictions. Enough to win. That&#x27;s what those who really value people are talking about. And I am grateful to everyone who spoke about it, including in Davos. Who talks about it in the media and in the capitals of leading countries. Despite pressure from all those stuck in the XX century, when the interests of nations were indeed often traded for attempts to appease the appetites of dictators. I signed a decree today on awarding our heroes. 144 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 17 of them posthumously. And, of course, I would like to congratulate the communications service employees on their professional day - the Day of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine. This is one of the most sensitive areas in modern warfare. Our joint success directly depends on the quality of your work, dear communications service employees. The success of our entire state. By my decree, I conferred the military rank of brigadier general upon three colonels of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection. I am grateful to everyone who defends the state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Saeima of Latvia</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-26</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mrs. Speaker, Mrs. Ināra! First of all, thank you for such kind words, thank you for your arrival, thank you for this support. Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear deputies of the Saeima! Dear Latvian people! I am glad to have the opportunity to address you today and, above all, to thank you for all the help that Ukraine has received from the Republic of Latvia and from many ordinary citizens of Latvia. You perceive our struggle for freedom as your own struggle. And this is true - because right now in Ukraine the fate of all of us, all Europeans, is being decided. It is the strength of weapons in the war that Russia has launched against our country, against Ukraine, and at the same time against the freedom of all its neighbors, that determines what will dominate in Europe for decades to come. Either it will be justice for every nation we strive for with you, or Russia will manage to make the words &quot;occupation&quot;, &quot;repression&quot;, &quot;deportation&quot; main again for different nations. I am grateful to you for the determination you’ve stood up for justice with. As early as 6 pm on February 23, &quot;Stingers&quot; from Latvia arrived in Ukraine. The weapons we received from you, from the first hours of Russia&#x27;s full-scale aggression, began to save the lives of our people. While many others hesitated, looking for excuses, you were among those who acted. And continue to help us to the maximum now. In the defense sphere, with the support for sanctions, humanitarian support and extremely warm attitude to our citizens who have found temporary shelter in Latvia. Ukraine will always remember your help. I am grateful to you for this, grateful for this help! So why did it happen that someone resolutely chooses the path of action and support, and someone does everything to really do nothing? Why can those who do not have great resources show great courage, and some quite powerful actors in global relations do not find in themselves a percentage of the power you have? Why can they tolerate criticism for cowardice, double standards and hypocrisy, even accusations of direct indulging in Russian aggression just to stay away and maintain contacts with Russia? There are various answers to these questions. Of course, often the answer is just money. There are those who are just looking for benefits and are able to think only about profits, interest and account statements. There are those who hope in vain that they will be able to pacify Russia if they remain silent and do not really fight aggression. But, in fact, these are not decisive factors. They are an add-on. The basis of everything is contempt for values. There are people - and many of them among the powerful of this world - who believe that not all nations matter. Who believe that a nation can simply be forgotten to try to keep peace. Even the temporary peace, even the illusory one. Even peace at the cost of tens of thousands killed, hundreds of thousands deported or millions deprived of their homeland. They are OK with that. Peace at the cost of the lives of others. But this should not be normal! In the past - and even in the very recent past - this disrespect for certain nations has led to terrible and insidious conspiracies and pacts that deprived statehood, destroyed borders and inflamed the appetite for war. Millions of people died because of it. The lives of generations have been poisoned. And it seemed that at least Europe and the Western world drew conclusions from their experience. But now we hear again that Russia should be given what it wants. That supposedly it is necessary to accept that some nations may be deprived of part of their foreign policy rights, because certain, as they say, &quot;historical force&quot; wants it. There are quite serious talks about drawing some dividing lines along the body of a sovereign state in order to allegedly &quot;appease&quot; the aggressor. And allegedly concessions, concessions and concessions again are needed - of course, at the expense of the state, which was attacked, so that the aggressor allegedly mercifully stops. And this is about Ukraine, which has been defending itself for the fourth month already in a full-scale war against the second strongest army in the world. And what will happen if Russia starts a war against states that have less internal potential for defense than Ukraine? Will the world help such states? Or will they be given up without any disputes at all? And it&#x27;s not just some speculation - it&#x27;s a reality. This is our reality. In Russia, they openly say that they will not stop in Ukraine. They need the Baltic states, Poland and other European countries. That is why we must restore full respect for the fundamental values on our continent. We must fight absolutely clearly and at all levels for the principle: every nation matters. The interests of any nation cannot be ignored, betrayed or exchanged for something in a relationship with those who want to make that nation dependent on themselves. When this principle is truly respected by all, in full, then European unity will work. And then Russia will stand no chance either in the war against Ukraine or in the war against any other European country. When Ukraine is told that we should not be given all the weapons we need to win, they actually mean that our nation is allegedly less important than other nations who have already been given or can use such weapons. When we are told that we have to give away part of our land because it is supposed to be a &quot;necessary compromise&quot;, it means that our people are considered less worthy of having their interests taken into account. Moreover, when they ask us to wait “a little longer” in the European Union&#x27;s reception room - years or decades - not agreeing to give us full membership, and some still doubt the candidate status for Ukraine, it only emphasizes that the principle of respect for every nation does not work. And it must work. Because if Russia starts a war, say, against any state, God forbid Latvia, all NATO members will have to decide whether to defend Latvia. If Russia provokes an emergency crisis on the borders or inside a country of the European Union, all EU members will have to decide whether to provide help. And what will they be able to decide if there is no respect for each nation? We must do our best to never see the obvious answer to the question asked this way. Ladies and Gentlemen! On March 1, at a meeting in Riga Castle, a decision was made to award me the Order of Viesturs of the first degree - the highest award of the Republic of Latvia. It is a great honor for me. But I perceive this as a distinction not of my personal activity, but of our common struggle. The struggle of the Ukrainian people for independence. The struggle of the Latvian people for freedom in Europe. The struggle of all Europeans, who truly respect our common values, for Europe to be truly strong and truly united. We need this unity to guarantee the security of both Ukraine and every other state that may be threatened by Russian aggression. We need the strength and unity of Europe for Russia to pay for this war - to pay the full price, in particular through sanctions and the confiscation of its assets. Having experienced these losses, it must learn that war creates the greatest problems for the aggressor first of all. It is necessary not only to finally agree on the sixth sanctions package against the Russian Federation, including the embargo on oil, oil blends and petroleum products. But also to prepare the seventh sanctions package - with even more powerful restrictions on Russia for terror against Ukraine. Just like Latvia, the whole of Europe must restrict Russia&#x27;s energy weapons. Fully. And, of course, we need the full potential of Europe to bring to justice those who organized and are carrying out genocide against the people of Ukraine in a competent court. And I am grateful to your state, to your President, Mr. Levits, for initiatives that will help bring Russian war criminals to justice. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Latvian people! Our parents hoped that the war would not hit our generation. That you and I would not be threatened by what previous generations had to endure. Occupation, repression, deportation… We have everything we need to eliminate these threats. And I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll do it. Together. And guided by our values. Paldies, Latvija! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Pressure on Russia is a matter of saving lives, and every day of delay is new killed Ukrainians and new threats on the continent - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-26</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Exactly eight years ago, on May 26, the Donetsk airport stopped working. There is still a message about this: &quot;Attention! From 7 am, Donetsk Airport will temporarily suspend flights. The resumption of the airport’s functioning will be announced additionally.&quot; On that day, apparently, no one foresaw how events in Donbas would develop over these years. And then - throughout Ukraine after a full-scale invasion. No one predicted for how long the word &quot;temporarily&quot; would be delayed in this announcement. But that day and any day later, and today, two things can be said with confidence. First. Ukraine will always be an independent state and will not be broken. The only question is what price our people will have to pay for their freedom, and Russia - for this senseless war against us. And second. The catastrophic developments could have been stopped if the world had treated the situation in Ukraine as its own. If the strong of the world had not played with Russia, but really pressed to end the war. Just look at the situation now. Look at the number of weeks the European Union has been trying to agree on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. So far, it receives almost a billion euros a day from Europeans for energy supplies. Of course, I am grateful to our friends who are promoting new sanctions. But where did those who block the sixth package get so much power? Why are they still allowed to have so much power, including in intra-European procedures? Look at the number of weeks the world has not dared to block the Russian banking system - all banks without exception, to deprive the aggressor of the opportunity to finance not only the war against us, but also the policy of creating splits and crises around the world. Look at how long we have been struggling to provide Ukraine with all the weapons it needs to change the nature of hostilities and start moving faster and more confidently to the expulsion of the occupiers. All weapons, including MLRS. The systems that are really needed to stop this aggression. We are confident that thanks to our efforts we will still be heard. Starting from May 26, 2014, and even more so from February 24 this year until today, there have been many opportunities for those who really have the strength to do so to put an end to it and say: now Russia will really feel the full price for what it is doing against Ukraine, against European unity and against freedom as such. The current offensive of the occupiers in Donbas can make the region uninhabited. They want to burn Popasna, Bakhmut, Lyman, Lysychansk and Severodonetsk to ashes. Like Volnovakha, like Mariupol. In cities and communities closer to the Russian border, in Donetsk and Luhansk, they gather everyone they can to fill the place of those killed and wounded in the occupation contingent. All this, including the deportation of our people and the mass killings of civilians, is an obvious policy of genocide pursued by Russia. Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians. A child (five months) and a father were killed. The mother is in grave condition. Among the wounded in Kharkiv is also a nine-year-old girl. Missile strikes again in the Sumy region, in Donbas again. Significant intensification of the occupiers&#x27; artillery in the Zaporizhzhia region again. Again, their efforts to burrow into the ground in the south. Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives. And every day of delay, weakness, various disputes or proposals to &quot;appease&quot; the aggressor at the expense of the victim is new killed Ukrainians. And new threats to everyone on our continent. I addressed the Latvian parliament and people today. Expressed gratitude for the help Ukraine received, including the defensive one. And for the help which the Latvian state and the Latvian people provide now. If everyone in the world had the same determination to defend our common freedom as Latvia and other partners who do not hesitate, there would simply be no evil that the Russian state has done to Ukraine, Europe and the world. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about the intensification of the occupiers&#x27; activities. We discussed how we can adequately enhance Ukraine&#x27;s ability to defend itself and repel these attacks. I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 180 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 28 of them posthumously. The total number of awarded servicemen as of today is over 16,000. Precisely - 16 thousand and 44. In 92 days. But it is clear that there are hundreds and hundreds of times more feats and victories of our defenders. I am grateful to everyone who holds the defense. Who helps the army and all our defenders. And finally. Usually these days in May we celebrate the last bell in schools and congratulate boys and girls on the beginning of a new stage in life. Frankly, a brighter stage than childhood. Because finally opportunities in life emerge. Adult opportunities. But childhood is still not over yet. This year there is no traditional school holiday in Ukraine. And this is understandable. Such a time. Such a situation. And not all schools in Ukraine finish the education process in May this year. And not all graduates are now in our country. But the constant thing is whatever the time and whatever the situation, we must not lose our opportunities. We have to fight. We have to develop. We have to defend our freedom and be able to use that freedom. So, we have to be educated and brave. Don&#x27;t lose a single day in your life. Know what you live the day for. And be sure to believe in Ukraine. Because it is here that Ukrainians have the best chance of success. And especially - after our victory. Which we will definitely gain. And we will definitely remove the phrase &quot;temporarily occupied&quot; in relation to our land, which will be liberated forever. No matter how difficult it may be. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine affects global situation - address by the President of Ukraine to the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI)</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-27</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you for the opportunity to contact you today and for the upcoming communication. I hope that this conversation will bring us closer to understanding how to prevent large-scale crises from unfolding in many parts of the world. And the world is now really on the verge of several crises. My country, Ukraine, is one of the largest and absolutely conscientious food exporters. Every year we export tens of millions of tons of grain and other agricultural products. Our producers provide a high place for Ukraine in the world&#x27;s top exports of wheat, corn and vegetable oil. But for the fourth month in a row, Ukrainian exports have been blocked due to a full-scale war waged by Russia against our state on our territory. Russia has blocked access to our ports in the Black Sea and occupied our part of the Sea of Azov. As a result of this military blockade, most traditional Ukrainian trade routes have been closed. Currently, 22 million tons of grain in Ukraine are in storage facilities. We cannot direct them to the world market, where they are needed right now, at this time. It is already felt that prices for grain, and later for other food, could rise catastrophically. And the governments of food-exporting countries have to adopt decisions to suspend the export of certain agricultural products from their countries to somehow keep domestic prices from explosive growth and protect their own consumption. According to the UN, this year the world&#x27;s hunger will affect an additional 40-50 million people. I consider such an assessment conservative. Hunger does not come alone. It is always accompanied by political chaos, which further aggravates the situation, destroys social life and creates even more dangerous conditions for ordinary people. Already in July - when last year&#x27;s stockpiles will run out in many countries - it will become clear that the catastrophe is really approaching. Just look at the prices in stores now - their growth is a harbinger of what will surely affect people if nothing changes, if we can&#x27;t change anything. It is a harbinger of poverty for the poor and impoverishment for the middle class. Just imagine the political chaos this could end with in certain regions. And I have cited only one aspect of how the war waged by Russia affects the whole world. And there are many such aspects, in addition to the threat of hunger and chaos. The very fact of Russia&#x27;s naval blockade of Ukraine is no less destabilizing for coexistence in the world. This is not just an act of aggression by one state against another. This blockade of our ports is a kind of training for other potential aggressors who want to conquer neighbors or take away their territory. If Russia manages to go unpunished with this in the war against Ukraine, other states will see that the naval blockade is a supposedly permissible instrument of pressure in the modern world. Consequently, none of the trade routes at sea and no country will be safe after that. Let’s take the third aspect - the nature of the war waged by the Russian state against us. Since February 24 this year, the Russian army has used 2,400 different missiles against Ukraine. The vast majority was aimed at civilian infrastructure. The enterprises, warehouses, in particular warehouses with food, apartment houses, railway infrastructure. By the way, this is also important in terms of food security. We want to prevent the food crisis from unfolding. We are working to shift our exports to new routes - as much as possible in wartime - and to supply grain to the world market by rail through European ports. Of course, this may be a smaller volume of exports than through the Black Sea. But Russia is also trying to thwart our efforts by destroying railway bridges, railway stations and logistics centers with missiles. Dozens of Ukrainian cities and hundreds of villages were destroyed by shelling by Russian aircraft and artillery. It&#x27;s just ruins. Black, scorched, empty cities. In three months, Russian warplanes have appeared in our skies more than 3,000 times. And there are no objects that they would try not to bomb. More than 600 healthcare facilities were destroyed - hospitals, maternity hospitals, clinics and outpatient clinics. Almost two thousand educational facilities - universities, schools, and kindergartens. Dozens of religious sites - churches, mosques, and other meeting places of religious communities - were burned or damaged by Russian shelling in various regions of Ukraine. Only yesterday and only in one of our cities, in Kharkiv, 9 people died as a result of Russian artillery strikes. Among them - a 5-month-old child and her father. The explosion threw the child from her father&#x27;s arms onto the roof of the house. She was not even found at first. The mother was seriously wounded. The Russian military fired at ordinary residential neighborhoods. And this is the daily reality of our country since February 24. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine began much earlier. Back in 2014, Russia captured our Crimean peninsula and started a war in Donbas - in two regions of our country. This war remained local for 8 years, until Moscow decided to go on the offensive against our entire state. What is the meaning of this war for Russia? They talk about it openly. The Russian leadership believes that Ukraine should be a colony of Russia. And the Ukrainians? If the nation does not want to submit, it is decided to destroy it. The occupiers are also deporting our people to Russia and settling them in various remote regions. The number of such deported Ukrainians is hundreds of thousands. And this is also one of the ways to conquer the people. In fact, it is shocking how frankly Russia is trying to bring back to world life the order of the old days, when colonizers and empires imposed their policies or their domination on other nations. The fourth aspect is the attitude of the Russian occupiers towards the people in the occupied territories. We have the experience of Crimea, which since 2014 has been under control of Russia as an occupier. And it has become one of the most dangerous places in Europe. For all those who value freedom, for the indigenous people of Crimea - the Crimean Tatars, and for Muslims on the peninsula. There is not a single week - I emphasize this: not a single week in 8 years - that there is no news of repressions or trials against those whom the occupiers are not satisfied with. As a result, you will not find a place in Europe other than the Russian-occupied Crimea, where Muslims and all others who simply want to live their free lives are being repressed with such impunity and massiveness. How can this be ignored? This is happening in front of the eyes of the whole world! And the fifth aspect is that there has long been no such risk of using weapons of mass destruction. Russian state propagandists are openly threatening nuclear weapons. World politicians are preparing for the possibility of Russia&#x27;s use of so-called tactical nuclear weapons or chemical weapons, biological weapons. What does this mean for the world? First of all, it can lead to a change in the attitude of different states to weapons of mass destruction. If Russia indulges in nuclear blackmail with impunity, it may seem logical to various forces in the world to acquire nuclear weapons for themselves. To say that it is dangerous for the whole world is to say nothing. Ukraine has made the greatest contribution to nuclear disarmament by relinquishing its third largest nuclear arsenal. This happened in the 1990s. Now Russia, contrary to its documented commitment to guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s security after our state&#x27;s renunciation of its nuclear status, is waging a war of aggression and colonization against us. And at the same time threatens with nuclear weapons. Who can believe in the idea of nuclear disarmament after that? And how to reliably guarantee long-term security to those regions that choose non-nuclear status after that? Six months ago, it was impossible to imagine that such questions would arise. But now it is also one of the consequences of Russia&#x27;s aggressive policy. Ladies and Gentlemen! I have given you only 5 aspects of how Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine affects the global situation. I&#x27;m sure you realize that there are many more such aspects. This is the largest war in Europe since World War II. And today no one can predict one hundred percent what negative aspects for the world will definitely not be caused by this war. The sooner this war can be ended, the better it will be for each nation. Not just for us. The sooner our ports are unblocked, the sooner the food crisis will stop, because we will be able to send our stocks and new crops to the world market. Which this year, by the way, will still be less, as Russian troops deliberately mined fields and destroyed agricultural machinery. I believe that Russia has deliberately made a bet on the food crisis. To increase the dependence of other countries on themselves and to make access to food another factor of pressure in global politics. The sooner our lands are liberated from the occupiers, the more secure, in fact, will be the protection of people all over the world. Protection from the aggressive desires of those who want to pursue colonial policies, as in the old days. If the world is truly united and honest about this Russian aggression against our sovereign state, the speed of ending this war will be measured in weeks. Weeks, not even months. I am grateful to the leader of your country, the President of Indonesia, for inviting me to the G20 summit in the autumn. I accepted this invitation. And I believe that by the summit in the autumn, the world will have solved all these big problems. We must prevent large-scale famine. We must stop mass killings and repression. We must permanently wean any countries in the world from nuclear blackmail and playing with the threat of chemical or biological weapons. And I believe that at this Summit there will be only friendly states, partner states, and there will be no occupiers. I ask all Indonesians to pray for peace in Ukraine, for the people of Ukraine and for the wisdom of the world to be enough to save humanity from existing threats. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukrainians and Americans have become much closer: we equally understand the word &quot;freedom&quot; - address by the President of Ukraine to the Stanford University community</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-27</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends! It is truly an honor to address your community for a second time - the Stanford University community - students, lecturers, all American men and women who care about Ukraine and empathize with our struggle for freedom. I am grateful to you for your interest and for such a number of sincere and caring bright eyes that I see now, see today. I see people in front of me, people who are not in bulletproof vests, who are not in helmets and who are not in bomb shelters. There are no wounded by enemy shelling among you. I am very glad. Glad for you. And this meeting of ours cannot be interrupted by an air alarm signal, because California is not threatened by Russian missiles. But, unfortunately, this is not the case in Ukraine. A lot has changed since last September, when I first visited Stanford during a visit to the United States. But on the other hand - much remains the same. As I said then, Ukraine is a country where anything is possible. And so it was. But now the whole world knows that even what others have been afraid to think about for many years is possible in Ukraine. Ukraine is a country that has destroyed the myth of the extraordinary power of the Russian army. An army that allegedly could conquer anyone it wants in a few days. But Ukraine is a country where the Russian army continues to wage a war it does not want to end. Now Russia is trying to occupy the whole country. But we feel strong enough to think about the future of Ukraine, which is and will be open to the world. Between September last year and May this year, our society has endured so much that I would not wish on any other nation. And we still have a new path to go from May this year to, say, the new September. I know that this path will be very difficult. Very painful. It will be a path on which young people won’t look at university professors or their friends from a peaceful life, as you do. But at their comrades in the trenches. And at the enemies who can be seen in sight or on video from reconnaissance drones. But I also know that for Ukraine on this path there will definitely be a stage where peace will begin. Now I use words that each and every one of you read and hear very often in the media, in books. &quot;Struggle for freedom&quot;, &quot;myth&quot;, &quot;Russian army&quot;, &quot;war&quot;, &quot;survived&quot;, &quot;trenches&quot;, &quot;path&quot;, &quot;peace&quot;. Each of these words seems to be immediately clear. But do you feel all their depth now? Yesterday, Russian troops again shelled the largest city in the east of our country - Kharkiv. Using MLRS and special artillery called &quot;Pion&quot;. This is heavy artillery - long range and powerful. It was with these weapons that the Russian army fired at ordinary residential areas of Kharkiv yesterday. Just houses. There was no military object there. As a result of this and other shellings, 9 people were killed in Kharkiv yesterday. Peaceful inhabitants. A family with a small child, 5 months old, was also shelled. The father died. The child died. The mother is badly wounded. We have been receiving such or similar messages for 93 days since February 24 and for 8 years since 2014. That&#x27;s how it is in Ukraine. Everyone who studies at Stanford is equally familiar with the question: what matters most to you and why? To study at your university, you need to write an essay in response to this question. And I&#x27;m sure a lot of brilliant essays have been written over the years at Stanford. And I am sure that in the last 8 years there have been many brilliant students at your university. Apparently, among them were those who survived the war. And their answers to this question - what matters most to you and why - probably differed significantly from the answers of those who were lucky enough to live in peace. And now I&#x27;m not talking about the quality of the text. I&#x27;m talking about the depth of the sense of words by a particular person. After the start of the full-scale war, we are holding a special award ceremony in Ukraine for our defenders. Those who excelled the most. And who was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. As a special tribute, I present the Order of the Golden Star to the Heroes of Ukraine in the hall of the presidential residence where the highest officials of foreign countries visiting Ukraine - presidents and heads of government - were usually met. Or I give the Order to the Hero&#x27;s relatives, if this title is awarded posthumously. One of our pilots was recently awarded. Combat aviation pilot. One of the best. He died in the battles for Ukraine. When I gave his Golden Star to his wife, I expressed my condolences. Condolences that he passed away. And tears appeared in her eyes. She replied that he had not passed away. That he had been in the sky for 30 years. And now he remained in the sky. And tears appeared in my eyes. I felt that death did not conquer these people, this family. He remained in the sky. He is alive to her. And it will always be so in this family. And all these words: &quot;sky&quot;, &quot;life&quot;, &quot;death&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot; - for him, for her, for me, for you - they are different. With their depth. Although these words sound the same to us. And this depth, this distance in the feelings, in fact, weighs a lot today. It explains, for example, why even on the 93rd day of the war we are forced to talk about increasing sanctions on Russia, which will be enough for this country to finally start looking for peace, at least thinking about it. It explains why it is sometimes so long and difficult for us to negotiate with our partners about the supply of exactly the weapons needed to liberate our land. Although they want to help. So for me, this question, on which you had to write an essay, feels different, a little different. Because, in fact, I have been answering this question for a very long time, more than 93 days, when I try to give my country everything it needs so that we can survive, defend our freedom and, in the end, win. What matters most to me and why? I do not know whether the current presidents of a state fighting for its freedom have ever answered this question. But here is my answer. Pragmatic. Weapons that will help overcome the technical and quantitative superiority of the Russian army. Sanctions that will stop the flow of money for Russian terror. Finances that will allow Ukraine to maintain social normalcy while the war continues. Blockade and confiscation of all Russian assets in foreign jurisdictions that should be used to rebuild everything that this Russian army has destroyed. A fair tribunal against all war criminals who killed, tortured, raped and deported our citizens. Updated efficient security architecture that will prevent such new wars in the world. And, of course, a complete restoration of normal peaceful life in our country. So that our people, our students, like you now, can communicate freely and in complete safety with the presidents of democratic states. So that Ukrainians, like you now, won’t need to think where the bomb shelter is. And so that they will not need to know what the air alarm sounds like at all. And I am grateful to all our friends in the world who make these words - and their depth - sound the same for everyone on whom decisions to help Ukraine depend. Many Ukrainians have recently learned about one of our boys. A child from Mariupol, a city that was completely destroyed by Russian shelling. This little boy in the evacuation was very grateful to all those who sheltered his family and other residents of Mariupol. He really wanted to thank those who helped. He invited everyone to pay a visit to him. He said - come to us next summer, to Mariupol. And he says: yes, there is no more city... but the sea is left! And this story is about life. Which is sure to win. And which matters most, in fact, for each and every one. And this story is about a man who remains sincere and grateful even in the most terrible circumstances, because he is a free man. And I believe that Ukrainians, having survived this war, will remain just that. Sincere, grateful and free. And I&#x27;m sure that after this war, something will change in the relationship between you - the American people - and us. It is already changing. We became much closer in our feelings. We know for sure that we mean the same thing when we say the word &quot;freedom.&quot; When I returned to Ukraine last September, I was very encouraged. I thought about how much we could do together. But now I feel a similar uplift. Because I see your eyes and I believe that many of you will be in Ukraine and will help our reconstruction after the war, because this is the biggest project on the protection of freedom, in which your generation can take part. Our cities are destroyed. Our sea is still blocked. But we remain free. And finally. On February 24, a full-scale war against Ukraine began, when 18-year-old Russian guys, military men, entered our country and entered the homes of our people. To kill, torture, rape. It is difficult to understand - for what? Difficult. And exactly three months later, on May 24, on the other side of the globe, in Texas, an 18-year-old guy entered a regular school to kill 19 children and 2 adults. It is impossible to understand at all. This is a tragedy. And we live in a terrible time when Americans express condolences to Ukrainians over the deaths in war. And Ukrainians express condolences to Americans over the deaths in peace. Please accept my condolences. Every day you should not just ask yourself another question, but be sure to find the answer: who matters most and why? This is the main question for me: who matters most and why? Take care of yourself, your family, loved ones, friends. Take care of the world. Thank you, America! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>If the occupiers think that Lyman or Severodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong; Donbas will be Ukrainian - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-27</span></div>
  <p>Unbreakable people of our bravest country! All our defenders! Today I want to begin this address with words of gratitude to all emergency care workers. Today is their professional holiday. These are people who are really indomitable, really brave, really committed to a good cause. It is impossible to even count how many lives were saved by emergency care workers. No matter what the conditions are, no matter what the time is, they always do their job. I am grateful to everyone for a really quick help and really dedicated work. Grateful for the work during the pandemic. I am grateful that now, during a full-scale war, people have access to the &quot;ambulance&quot; in areas of hostilities. I am grateful for the real heroism, which is shown everywhere - by both paramedics and drivers. Unfortunately, this war also took the lives of those who did everything to save others. Eternal memory to them! Today, the representatives of our state - the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health - presented awards to emergency care workers. And this is the minimum that the state can do to honor what they are doing. But there will definitely be a maximum. Before this war, until February 24, we did everything to raise the salaries of the emergency care employees to a decent level. And we will definitely continue this policy when we achieve peace for our country. I held a meeting with the Cabinet of Ministers today. Heard the reports on a wide range of issues. I expect greater activity from government officials. In particular, to overcome the shortage of fuel caused by Russian strikes at the refinery in Kremenchuk and oil depots in different regions of the country. And to provide jobs for our people. And on other important economic issues. I continue to gather the broadest possible international support for our struggle. Today I addressed the political and expert communities of Indonesia. We talked about the threats that Russia has created for every country in the world now. The food crisis alone means a lot. Due to the Russian blockade of our ports, there is a shortage of food in the market. Consequently, price increases are being provoked. Consequently, political chaos is being provoked in those countries that are most dependent on our exports. I am grateful to the Indonesians for understanding the arguments of our country and for their support in countering crises Russia is provoking. I talked to Stanford University students today. It is one of the world&#x27;s leading universities. It was nice to see Ukrainian students studying there. It was also gratifying to hear how sincerely and fully the American student community is aware that we in Ukraine are fighting for our common freedom - one for all in the world. I invited Stanford students to join the implementation of the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after graduation. Because this will really be the biggest project of protecting freedom for their generation. I spoke today with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on how to prevent further development of the food crisis. And on the supply of fuel to Ukraine - this topic is a must in all my contacts with European partners. And on the defensive support for our state. Of course, the situation on the battlefield was discussed in detail. Difficult situation in Donbas. As expected, the situation is very difficult. The occupiers are trying to achieve in at least a hundred days of war the goals they hoped to achieve in the first days after February 24. Therefore, they concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves in Donbas. There are missile strikes and aircraft attacks - everything. We are protecting our land in the way that our current defense resources allow. We are doing everything to increase them. And we will increase them. If the occupiers think that Lyman or Severodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian. Because this is us, this is our essence. And even if Russia brings destruction and suffering everywhere there, we will still rebuild every city and every community. And there is and will be no alternative to our Ukrainian flags there. As always, I signed a decree today to award our military. 198 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 4 of them posthumously. As well as 27 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Eternal glory to all who fight for our independence! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Terror has become in fact the only form of Russian action against both Ukraine and Europe - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-28</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 94th day of the full-scale war is over. The situation is very complicated. Especially in those areas in Donbas and the Kharkiv region, where the Russian army is trying to squeeze at least some result for themselves. The key areas of struggle at the front are still Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Popasna and other cities where the Russian offensive is concentrated. But our defense holds on. It&#x27;s indescribably difficult there. And I am grateful to all those who withstand this onslaught of the occupiers. We work every day to strengthen our defense. This is primarily a supply of weapons. Every day we are bringing closer the time when our army will surpass the occupiers technologically and by firepower. Of course, a lot depends on the partners. On their readiness to provide Ukraine with everything necessary to defend freedom. And I expect good news on this already next week. Today, the Russian army has launched absolutely senseless, openly barbaric strikes at the Sumy region. Missiles, mortars. And for what? And what does it give? Ukrainians of the Sumy region, as well as any other region of our state, have already understood everything about Russia. And it will not be able to add anything by the new terror. And even more so, it will not be able to intimidate. As a result of the Russian shelling of Mykolaiv today one person died, seven were wounded, two - in a grave condition. The shells hit a residential area, twenty meters from the kindergarten. These are the enemies chosen by the Russian Federation. Again and again I will remind the world that Russia must finally be officially recognized as a terrorist state, a state - sponsor of terrorism. This is simply true. This is fair and reflects the daily reality that the occupiers have created in Ukraine and are eager to bring further to Europe. And this must be legally enshrined. I am preparing for the meeting of the European Council, which will take place on May 30-31. I will address the participants of the meeting. In particular, I will talk about it. About terror, which has become in fact the only form of action of the Russian state in relation to Europe. Terror on the land of Ukraine. Terror in the energy market of Europe, not just our country. Terror in the food market, on a global scale. And what terror will be next? Only together - all Europeans - will we be able to stop such a policy of such a state. Of course, in my address to the European Council I will pay due attention to the progress in the development of our state, which has already been achieved and which can be achieved in the near future. I will also continue to address the parliaments of European countries next week. There will be many other international activities aimed at strengthening our state and increasing the joint pressure of the whole free world on Russia. I spoke today with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On defensive support and fuel supply to Ukraine. On how we can unblock Ukrainian ports, and therefore prevent the food crisis from unfolding. Security guarantees for Ukraine were also discussed separately, and we need to intensify work on them. There is more and more information that the occupiers are trying to limit the departure of our people from the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region. They do not provide any humanitarian corridors. And they have closed the individual departure of people. Those who are confident in their position would definitely not make such decisions. This is clearly a sign of weakness. Manifestation that they have nothing to give people. And people do not want to take anything from them. So they try to take people hostage. But Ukraine will return everything that belongs to it. Everything. Definitely. And it&#x27;s only a matter of time. And every day this time, the time of liberation, is reduced. We do everything for this. Eternal gratitude and glory to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to everyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This war is going on now for the happiness of living your normal life and just walking the streets of your city, that&#x27;s what we are fighting for in it – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-29</span></div>
  <p>Strong people of our indomitable country! All our defenders! This address of mine is dedicated to four cities of Ukraine: Kharkiv, Kyiv, Severodonetsk and Kryvyi Rih. And through them - to our whole state, to all our cities and communities. Today I visited Kharkiv. Both the city itself and the frontline positions of our military in the region. Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers. Black, burnt-out, half-ruined apartment buildings face east and north with their windows - from where Russian artillery was firing. From where Russian combat aircraft arrived. They face Russia. And in them now, like in a mirror, the Russian state can see itself. See how much it lost during these 95 days of full-scale war against Ukraine. Russia has already lost not only the battle for Kharkiv, not only the battle for Kyiv and the north of our country. It lost its own future and any cultural ties to the free world. They all burned down. In particular, there, in Saltivka. I held a meeting with the leadership of the region and the city. Thanked them for being and remaining together with the people of Kharkiv, together with Ukraine. And - what is very important now - together with each other. They have one hundred percent cooperation - the army, the police, the mayor of Kharkiv, the regional state administration - everyone really works for victory and does it very effectively. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the local leadership of the Security Service of Ukraine. I arrived. Clarified the situation. Dismissed the head of the Security Service of the region. For not working to defend the city from the first days of a full-scale war, but thinking only of himself personally. What were the motives? Law enforcement officers will find out. One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation. We will definitely liberate the entire territory. And everyone should work for this result in positions both at the local level and at the state level. Before the trip, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 222 combatants were awarded state awards. And during the trip today I had the honor to personally present some of the awards from this decree and others that were signed earlier. The post-war reconstruction of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region was discussed very objectively with the local authorities. We must use only advanced ideas, only modern technologies in reconstruction. In particular, security technologies. And the best offers from our partners. Kharkiv and all other cities and communities in our country affected by the war must be reconstructed to have the most modern look in Europe. Returning from the east to Kyiv at this time leaves a rather ambiguous impression. After Saltivka&#x27;s silence, there is Khreshchatyk, full of people and smiles. After the roar of artillery on the frontline - the relaxation of Kyiv residents who today walked the city. On the City Day, the Day of Kyiv, which is celebrated by thousands of people every year. But it is for such happiness to live, live your normal life and just quietly walk the streets of your own city that this war is going on now. That&#x27;s what we are fighting for in it. For everyone in Ukraine. Freedom and peace is what could really be felt in Kyiv today. Even in spite of the air-raid siren that sounded today as well. So, I wish you, the people of Kyiv, to keep this peace - the peace of life. Take care of your city. And be sure to remember what it cost to defend the capital. Remember how many lives were given for the capital. I understand that in your eyes - it&#x27;s summer already. I understand all this. But I want you to have an understanding - we still have to fight. The war is not over yet. Sophia and Lavra, Andriivskyi, Podil, Volodymyrska, Reytarska, Lypky and Khreshchatyk... I am grateful to everyone who made sure that the occupiers would never have a place here in Kyiv again. And I am very much looking forward to the day when I will be able to say similar words to another of our cities. A city that should celebrate its Day today in the same way as Kyiv. But... Russia came too close to it. It gathered too many forces in our Donbas. It was too prepared for the offensive there. I consider it very symbolic that the Russian military began the attempt to capture Severodonetsk by entering a hotel called “Myr” (Peace - ed.). Peace is indeed Russia&#x27;s first target. Having taken away our peace in 2014, the occupiers want to take away everything else. Literally everything. They want to leave us neither freedom, nor houses, nor life. As a result of the Russian strikes at Severodonetsk, the entire critical infrastructure of the city has already been destroyed. 90% of houses are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city&#x27;s housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no mobile connection. Constant shelling. Capturing Severodonetsk is a fundamental task for the occupying contingent. And they don&#x27;t care how many lives they will have to pay for this attempt to raise the Russian flag on 32 Druzhby Narodiv boulevard (Friendship of Nations - ed.) - no matter how bitter the name sounds now - where the Severodonetsk administration is located. We are doing everything to repel this offensive. There was not a day that we did not try to find more weapons, more modern weapons to defend our land, to defend our people. And I am grateful to everyone who defends Severodonetsk and demonstrates to the occupiers that peace will still be ours. In all our state, in all Donbas and of course - in Severodonetsk. And another city I want to address today. For me, of course, the city is special. My native Kryvyi (Kryvyi Rih - ed.) also celebrates its birthday today. Already 247th. It would celebrate. But the time is not appropriate. The conditions are not appropriate. And the enemy is still on our land. The time to celebrate will be after our victory. And it will come. And today I want to wish just that - to my hometown and to all cities and communities of our great country. A shorter time to victory. We must all work for this - each and every one without exception. In my inaugural speech three years ago, I said that each of us is a president. And right now it is felt the most. Because our future depends not only on my actions in this office, the office of the President of Ukraine, or on what is being done in other offices in Kyiv. But also on what is being done in Kharkiv, Sumy, Kryvyi Rih and Odesa, Lviv and Uzhhorod, Lutsk and Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv and Dnipro, Zhytomyr and Chernihiv, Poltava and Kropyvnytskyi, Chernivtsi, Frankivsk, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy. Of course, in Kherson, in the Zaporizhzhia region, and in all territories of our Donbas and Crimea. The unity I saw with my own eyes today in Kharkiv. The heroism our soldiers in Donbas show every day. The determination of Kryvyi Rih. This is our path. The path to ensure that the peace of life is always felt throughout Ukraine and that smiles always reign, not the roar of artillery. Eternal glory to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the European Council</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-30</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President Michel. Dear Mrs. President Roberta. Dear friends! I am glad to be able to address all of you without exception. Today is the 96th day of Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against our state, against all of us and against all of you. Against European unity. Russia wants to see at such meetings not a united European Council that we see now, not a united European Union, but 27 separate states, 27 fragments that cannot be put together. This is their wish. This policy of the aggressor is consistent, and there is no delay in it. Unlike Europe, Russia does not need to hold such summits and seek compromises for weeks. By the way, I want to thank you for talking about these compromises, for striving to find help and support for Ukraine. So, they are not ready to compromise, choosing what to do to achieve their goals. And now we see how the Russian offensive in Donbas is destroying our cities, destroying the communities of Ukraine, and at the same time how the European unity, the desired European unity may falter. On April 8, the 44th day of the war, the EU&#x27;s fifth sanctions package was imposed. And 52 days have passed since then. What happened during this period? At that time, as of April 8, there were 169 children on the list of those killed by the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. As of today 243 children are on the list. At that time, as of April 8, 928 educational institutions were destroyed. Kindergartens, schools, universities. As of today – 1888. According to the information for the past day, the number of Russian missile strikes at Ukraine is already almost 1,600. Russia has used more than 2,400, almost 2,500 different missiles against us, against the civilian population. And then, as of April 8, there were less than a thousand strikes and they used about a thousand missiles. This is the progress of their aggression. And, of course, I want you to understand me - I&#x27;m not blaming any of you. It is only the Russian state that is to blame for everything that is happening. But I am convinced that it is obvious to each and every one of you that there should be progress in sanctions for this aggression. And for us it is crucial. And it will help us a lot! The progress that makes Russia begin to seek peace. And only this can be our common demand. Peace. There can be no compromises at the expense of our territorial integrity, our sovereignty! I am grateful to everyone who promotes the sixth sanctions package and tries to make it effective. However, unfortunately, for some reason it is not there yet. And why do you depend on Russia, on their pressure, not vice versa? Russia must depend on you. Why can Russia still earn almost a billion euros a day by selling energy resources? Why are banks of a terrorist state still working with Europe and the global financial system? Serious questions. And why are Russian propaganda channels still active in the European Union? This is an information weapon of the Russian Federation. Why are Russian civil servants who support the war and judges who openly support repression still not under sanctions? Each of these important questions is not just about sanctions packages or the war in Ukraine. All this is about us. All this is about Europe itself. Dear friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! Only through greater unity can we find effective responses to everything that Russia is doing against us and against you. If someone torpedoes a ship, one or more cabins cannot hope to stay afloat when others drown. You can see that the consequences of Russia&#x27;s aggression have gone beyond our continent. And they will definitely return with even bigger problems for the whole of Europe. For example, large-scale famine in Africa and Asia will mean a threat of a new large-scale migrant crisis for southern and south-eastern Europe. And when you hear food blackmail from Moscow, please know that this is their deliberate strike at your societies. To ensure this strike, Russia simply uses the people of Africa and Asia as hostages, deliberately pushing them to starvation. So that people from there flee to you en masse. Are you ready for this? I don’t think so. Let&#x27;s take a look at price instability in the energy market. It&#x27;s not just some of the usual market fluctuations periodically observed. Last year, Russia created conditions for the record increase in gas prices. Now, investing in instability, Russia is making all energy prices skyrocket. For what? For Europeans to protest, not against the aggressor and their aggression, but against their own states. Against you personally. Against their leadership. And if this is a threat to each and every one of you, if this is Russia&#x27;s bet on political chaos in your countries, why do some people still think they can defend themselves alone? Europe must show strength. Because Russia perceives only strength as an argument. It&#x27;s time. It’s time for you to be not separate, not fragments, but one whole. Ukraine has shown by its own example why this is important. Why it&#x27;s important to be united. In our country, starting from February 24 there is the maximum unity, everyone is working for one result - state protection. And thanks to this we managed to do what the world did not expect, Russia did not expect - Ukraine stopped their army, and everyone was afraid of it, everyone remembers. And we managed to liberate part of our occupied territory. Greater unity is truly the foundation of this strength. You know this. Finally, all quarrels in Europe must end, internal discord that only encourages Russia to put more and more pressure on you, on the whole of Europe. The sixth sanctions package must be agreed upon. It must be effective - including oil. So that Russia feels the price of what it is doing against Ukraine and against the whole of Europe. And for you and us to finally become independent from Russian energy weapons. At least from its oil part. And we must immediately find a solution that will prevent the food crisis from unfolding. Of course, I thank you for your efforts together with partners to create green corridors for agricultural exports from Ukraine. But still, you understand that a reliable guarantee of food security is impossible without ending Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine on our land. Because there can be no peaceful trade, no steady agricultural production, if Russia retains the ability to intercept ships with Ukrainian agricultural products. And not only in the Black Sea. Or to strike at our cities, ports, elevators, other infrastructure. Mr. President Michel! You were recently in Odesa and were forced to go into a shelter due to a missile attack. Mr. President has felt for himself what I am talking about now. And if this was felt even at such level, why is Russia still not recognized as a terrorist state, a state - sponsor of terrorism? And another aspect. The European home was never complete without Ukraine. It won’t be. There will never be a full-fledged European power without Ukraine. The very fact that Ukraine remained a fragment of Europe, somewhere outside your countries, contributed to the fact that Russia has developed an aggressive appetite to seize its neighbors. Only the enlargement and strengthening of European unity can prevent the recurrence of what Europe experienced on February 24, in 2014, and even in 1968 or 1956. Therefore - at the strategic level - the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union for Ukraine should be approved already in June. I would like to express gratitude to the countries of the Western Balkans for their understanding and support for granting candidate status to our country. Thank you very much. On April 8, when the fifth sanctions package was approved, we also received a questionnaire from the European Union. And we have already answered it over this time. We have already provided these answers to the European Commission. Unprecedentedly fast, and most importantly - in a coordinated manner. We expect the same reaction from Europe. And we reject any attempt to find an alternative that no one needs, or to find something else for Ukraine. We need to be like you. We want Ukraine to receive candidate status. We have met all the necessary criteria for this status. And I am sure that those individual states that are still hesitant about us, you know it well, will change their minds and show our united strength. The strength of our nations who support our membership in the European Union by an unprecedented majority. The strength of your nations, the strength of your states and a united Europe. I want to thank you for your unity, ability to be united, energetic, to have a future in a strong European Union and to ensure that the developments in the world depend on us. So that we depend on ourselves, not on some offices somewhere in Moscow. Right now you can determine whether everything that the European Union says about itself is true. About unity in diversity, common values and the same approach to all European democracies. We need a common customs space that will strengthen both Ukraine and all those involved in trade with us. We need a common payment space that will accelerate integration at the level of ordinary people. And a common roaming space. It is very important for our displaced people, more than 5 million of them, not to experience discrimination. And, of course, further armed and financial support for Ukraine is absolutely necessary. Now our common freedom depends on our success on the battlefield, and your stability depends on our stability. And this is another reason to find and freeze, and then confiscate all Russian assets and allocate them for the reconstruction and compensation for the damage caused by the war. Dear colleagues! Dear friends! We have already started a conversation with most of you about rebuilding Ukraine. We are creating a large-scale recovery plan. The global United24 support project has been activated. The European Commission is also preparing a platform for reconstruction. I urge all of you to join these initiatives now. If rebuilding begins during the war and becomes truly pan-European, it will be one of the most convincing pieces of evidence for everyone and, of course, for Russia in particular, that Europeans are strong. And they will not allow any of the integral parts of Europe to be destroyed. Neither Ukraine nor any other part. And finally. A 9-year-old girl died today as a result of the Russian shelling of the Kherson region of Ukraine. Two more children were wounded: a 7-month-old baby and a 5-year-old girl. A normal person can’t just put up with it. With such crimes. Daily crimes. These are the deliberate killings by the Russian military of our civilians, our children. They know exactly who they are firing at. And I really count on your principledness and activity to bring to justice every Russian soldier who killed or tortured our people, and every commander who gave or condoned such orders. Europe can definitely do that. Let&#x27;s do it! Because this is not just a question of the aggressor&#x27;s responsibility for a particular war, but of protecting humanity as such. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In any case, Europe will have to give up Russian oil and oil products, because it is about the independence of Europeans themselves from Russia&#x27;s energy weapons - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-30</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, one of the key tasks of the day was communication for the approval of the sixth package of sanctions by the European Union. The pause in agreeing on new sanctions in Europe has been too long. The fifth sanctions package was introduced on April 8. So, a lot of time has passed without strengthening European sanctions against Russia. I emphasized that this should finally be corrected - and corrected immediately - in my address to the leaders of European countries who gathered for a meeting of the European Council. In particular, to discuss this issue. I am grateful to Charles Michel, President of the European Council, for supporting the interests of Ukraine, the interests of the whole of Europe and for trying to find the necessary compromises as soon as possible so that the European Union&#x27;s sixth sanctions package can be adopted. Russia must feel a much higher price for its aggression. The key point is, of course, the oil. I believe that Europe will have to give up Russian oil and oil products in any case. Because this is about the independence of Europeans themselves from Russian energy weapons. And the sooner this happens, the more complete the abandonment of Russian oil will be, the greater the benefit will be for Europe itself in the end. I also spoke today about strengthening sanctions with the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France. Catherine Colonna paid a visit to Kyiv. In addition to sanctions, we also discussed the issues of defense support for Ukraine, our European integration and the need to act much faster to prevent the escalation of the food crisis in the world. Now, due to the fact that Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and seized our part of the coast of the Sea of Azov, we cannot export 22 million tons of grain that are already in warehouses in our country. This is the volume that was to enter the foreign market. And Russia&#x27;s blockade of our exports is destabilizing the situation on a global scale. As a result, food is becoming increasingly expensive in different countries. Consequently, there is a threat of famine. In Africa, in Asia, in some European countries. This threat could escalate into a new migrant crisis. And this is what the Russian leadership clearly wants. They are deliberately creating this problem. So that the whole of Europe faces difficulties. And so that Ukraine does not receive billions of dollars for its exports. These are the billions that our economy really needs now. And the inhabitants of African and Asian countries are used by the Russian state simply as a bargaining chip. Against this background, the stories of Russian officials at various levels that some sanctions allegedly do not allow them to increase exports of their food look particularly cynical. As if they allegedly want to prevent a crisis, but sanctions allegedly hinder them. It is clear that they are lying, as always. First, Russian food was not blocked by sanctions. And secondly, in our occupied territory, the Russian invaders have already stolen at least half a million tons of grain and are now looking for ways to illegally sell it somewhere. To sell it in a way to make money on what was stolen and to keep the deficit in the legal market. I spoke today with Turkish President Erdoğan, in particular, about this threat to food security. About how to ensure normal traffic from Ukrainian Black Sea ports. And, of course, about how to speed up the end of this war - Russia&#x27;s war against our state. We also discussed further defense cooperation between Ukraine and Turkey. Today in the Luhansk region, the occupiers disrupted the evacuation from the areas of hostilities by firing at a car following the locals. French journalist Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff was killed by the shelling. He worked for the French TV channel BFM TV. A little over a month ago, I gave an interview to this particular TV channel. This was my first interview with the French media during a full-scale war. My sincere condolences to Frédéric&#x27;s colleagues and family. He became the 32nd media representative killed after February 24. The situation in Donbas remains extremely difficult. The Russian army is trying to gather overwhelming forces in certain areas to put more and more pressure on our defenders. There, in Donbas, the maximum combat power of the Russian army is now gathered. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Kurakhove, Slovyansk and some other settlements remain key targets for the occupiers in this direction. And I am grateful to all our defenders who, despite the technical and sometimes quantitative advantage of the occupiers, heroically hold the defense. Today, Russian troops shelled Kharkiv again. The territory of our Sumy region was also shelled across the border between Ukraine and Russia. The struggle for the Kherson region continues. Step by step, we are liberating our land and gradually approaching the point where Russia will have to lay down its arms, count all its dead and move to diplomacy. Definitely have to. Eternal glory to everyone who defends the independence of Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who died at the hands of the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everyone should be a lobbyist for the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine, which can speed up our victory - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-05-31</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Finally, we have the specifics about the European Union&#x27;s sixth sanctions package on Russia for this war. The package was agreed. Its approval and entry into force will take some time. But the key elements of the package are already clear, and most importantly - its direction. European countries have agreed to significantly limit oil imports from Russia. And I am grateful to everyone who worked to reach this agreement. The practical result is minus tens of billions of euros, which Russia will now be unable to use to finance terror. But it is also important to understand that European countries&#x27; abandonment of Russian oil and other fossil fuels will accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources. Strategically, this leaves the Russian state on the sidelines of the modern economy. With such an aggressive policy and a course of isolation from the civilized world, Russia simply will not be able to adapt. So, it will lose. Lose economically. We are also looking forward to the disconnection of one of the largest Russian banks - Sberbank - from SWIFT within the sixth sanctions package. Finally, there is the cessation of broadcasting of Russian disinformation channels in Europe. And new personal sanctions. We will also work on new restrictions against Russia for this war. As soon as the sixth package starts working, we will start preparing the seventh. After all, there must be no significant economic relations of the free word with the terrorist state. I discussed further sanctions policy of the European Union with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová. I am grateful to her, a true friend of Ukraine, for today&#x27;s visit to Kyiv, for substantive negotiations and for an inspiring speech in the Verkhovna Rada. From the first days of the full-scale war, Slovakia has become one of our most important defense partners. And we will continue this cooperation. We also talked today about Ukraine&#x27;s European movement. Mrs. Zuzana personally helps accelerate the integration of our state. And we will always be grateful for that. We are also preparing solutions for more effective management of processes at the borders of our states. In particular, joint customs control. At the beginning of her visit to Ukraine, the President of Slovakia visited Irpin and Borodyanka and saw with her own eyes the destruction caused by the Russian army. Anyone who sees this for themselves no longer needs to be persuaded why Russia must bear maximum responsibility for this war. I believe that Slovakia will provide all the necessary assistance to bring to justice all Russian war criminals and to rebuild everything they destroyed after the war. Today I would also like to address those in Ukraine who are trying, so to speak, to &quot;hurry up&quot; the Armed Forces of our state or to indicate how to attack and where to repel enemies in the first place. Ukraine values every opinion. But Ukraine values every life first and foremost. And this is an axiom. And Ukraine will never do like Russia, which throws people into hell of battles just because Moscow wanted to seize something in a few days or by a certain date. Our military, intelligence, the National Guard and all those involved in the defense of the state are gradually but inevitably thwarting all the plans of the occupiers. The frontline situation must be assessed comprehensively. Not by one area, where there is the most tough situation and which attracts the most attention, but by the whole frontline. The situation in the Donbas direction is very difficult. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Kurakhove are now at the epicenter of the confrontation. Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Severodonetsk, the Russian army&#x27;s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just madness. But on the 97th day of such a war, it is no longer surprising that for the Russian military, for Russian commanders, for Russian soldiers, any madness is absolutely acceptable. We have certain success in the Kherson direction, as well as an advancement in the Kharkiv region. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are rebuffing the pressure of the occupiers in the Zaporizhzhia region, the key direction is Hulyaipole and Orikhiv. In this broad picture, it must be seen that our defenders are showing the utmost courage and remain masters of the frontline situation, despite the fact that the Russian army still has a significant advantage in equipment and numbers. Of course, everyone in Ukraine wants all our territories, all our people to be liberated today, as soon as possible. The full restoration of the territorial integrity of our state is our goal. But we must act carefully, valuing life. Everyone at all levels must now be lobbyists for the supply of modern heavy weapons and modern artillery to our state. All those systems that can really speed up the victory of Ukraine. Talk about it wherever it is useful and wherever it is heard. Speak to the politicians of the partner countries, to the representatives of foreign media, even to your friends abroad. This narrative of the need to provide Ukraine with enough weapons to win must be maintained constantly. I work for this every day. I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 215 combatants were awarded state awards, 17 of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who are fighting for our independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every person matters, this is the main thing that distinguishes us from the occupiers - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-01</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Defenders! Every year on June 1 we celebrate Children&#x27;s Day. A special day when adults pay special attention to the rights of children, safety and development of our kids. But since February 24, everything has changed in our country. And literally every day now is a day of protection for us. Protection of all our people, children, our future. Protection of a free country where every child can, when he or she grows up, live the life he or she wants. Without coercion and oppression. Everyone sees what Russia brings to Ukraine and what it wants to bring to other European countries. Total contempt for individuals, for entire nations. The Russian state despises even its own citizens so much that they do not understand the value of human life at all. Russian soldiers kill and die themselves as if they were not people, but just dust. Dust under the feet of the owners of Russia. The principles of our life are completely different. And although life has changed with the onset of wartime, our principles remain the same. Every person matters. This is the main thing that distinguishes us from the occupiers. During the 98 days of the Russian invasion, 689 children were injured as a result of the occupiers&#x27; attacks. And these are only those we know about. We do not yet have all the information from the territory that is currently occupied. But from what is known today - 446 children were injured, 243 children died. 139 went missing. It is said that human consciousness does not perceive large numbers. The larger the number, the harder it is for a person to realize what is behind it. Destroyed families. Little personalities who did not even have time to see what life is like. Like little Denys from the Zhytomyr region, from the village of Malynivka, who died with his whole family when a Russian plane dropped bombs on the village. Denys was less than two years old. Like Stepan from the village of Novi Petrivtsi, Kyiv region. He was less than three years old when a Russian shell hit the yard. The kid was fatally wounded. Like Anya from Bucha, Kyiv region, she was 14 years old. She was killed when the Russian military fired at a minibus on the road. People were just trying to escape. Anya was in that car with her mother and grandmother. They all died. Polina, she was not even two years old. A Russian tank fired at a house in Borodyanka. An ordinary house. Direct hit. Polina died. Arina, Mykolaiv region. On March 5, she received shrapnel wounds as a result of artillery shelling, the occupiers hit the usual residential sector. She died at the hospital. Now, in June, Arina could be 4 years old. Svyatoslav from Odesa, he was 15 years old. He was killed by a Russian missile strike at a dormitory. It happened on May 2. His body was retrieved from the rubble of the house. Alisa from Okhtyrka, Sumy region. 7-year-old kid. She died on the second day of a full-scale war as a result of Russian artillery shelling. The occupiers simply fired at the houses. Mykyta from the city of Izyum, Kharkiv region. He was 3 years old. On the night of March 3, he was killed by a Russian air strike at the city. A total of nine people died that night. Two sisters - Varvara and Polina from Mariupol. Varvara was 14 years old and Polina was 11. They died as a result of the Russian shelling of an apartment building. I have named only ten children from the list of two hundred and forty-three. And it&#x27;s not just numbers. Each line is a separate world that was destroyed by the Russian army. In this list there are those about whom nothing is known at all, even the name... 243 children! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken away by the Russian war against us, against Ukrainians, against Ukraine. About 12 million of our citizens have been forced to flee their homes due to the war. More than 5 million went abroad. And the vast majority of them are women with children. We will do everything so that they can return home to Ukraine. Russia is also pursuing a consistent criminal policy of deporting our people. Forcibly deports both adults and children. This is one of Russia&#x27;s most heinous war crimes. In total, more than 200,000 Ukrainian children have been deported so far. These are orphans from orphanages. Children with parents. Children separated from their families. The Russian state disperses these people on its territory, settles our citizens, in particular, in remote regions. The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people, but to make deportees forget about Ukraine and not be able to return. But we must find a solution to this challenge as well. And ensure that all those who killed, tortured or deported Ukrainians are held accountable. The inevitability of punishment is a principle that Ukraine will definitely teach Russia. But first of all, we must teach it on the battlefield that Ukraine will not be conquered, that our people will not surrender, and our children will not become the property of the occupiers. Today I signed two new decrees on awarding our heroes. 380 combatants were awarded. In total, since the beginning of the full-scale war, 17 thousand 86 defenders of Ukraine have received orders and other awards. Thanks to all those who defend our state, our people, our children, we can be sure that Ukraine has everything, and has a future. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by the President of Ukraine in the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-02</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, members of the government, everyone present! Dear people of Luxembourg! Thank you for the opportunity to contact you. Your state has a wise and extremely relevant motto: &quot;We want to stay what we are.&quot; And this is now perceived in a special way. You cannot pass by these words. Because what are we fighting for? For what we are. And to stay what we are. Free, independent, open and united with all Europeans. We have been fighting for this right, this aspiration for a very long time. Much longer than Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against Ukraine. By the way, tomorrow is the hundredth day of this war. And when this characteristic is used - full-scale - it is usually just a rhetorical separation of the ongoing war from the war that Russia started in 2014. Then, 8 years ago, the Russian army invaded our land and occupied part of it for the first time. The Crimean peninsula and a third of Donbas, including the largest cities, Donetsk and Luhansk. The fighting in Donbas lasted for 8 years. There were very hot and bloody phases of confrontation. There were also short periods of ceasefire, which cost many great diplomatic efforts. Ukraine has lost more than 14,000 people killed - from 2014 to February 24 this year. More than one and a half million people have become internally displaced persons. As a result of the then campaign of invasion, the Russian army controlled more than 43,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory. This area is comparable, for example, to the area of the Netherlands. And for most European countries, such a scale of war would be enormous already. But on February 24, Russia showed that it was not a scale at all for it. It showed that its cruelty is much greater. Russian troops entered 3,620 settlements in Ukraine. 1,017 of them have already been liberated. Another 2,603 are to be released. As of today, about 20 percent of our territory is under the control of the occupiers. Almost 125 thousand square kilometers. This is much larger than the area of all the Benelux Countries combined. About 300 thousand square kilometers are bestrewn with mines and unexploded ordnance. Almost 12 million Ukrainians have become internally displaced persons. More than 5 million, mostly women and children, have gone abroad. Fighting continues on the huge territory from the city of Kharkiv in the east of our country to the city of Mykolaiv in the south. A straight line between them is 454 kilometers long. But if you look at the entire frontline, and it is, of course, not straight, this line is more than a thousand kilometers. Just imagine! Constant fighting, which stretched along the frontline for more than a thousand kilometers. Every day Ukraine suffers from Russian missile strikes. Just yesterday, Russia used 15 different cruise missiles. And since February 24, 2,478 missiles have been used. Most of them were aimed at civil infrastructure. We have to defend ourselves against virtually the entire Russian army. All combat-ready Russian military units are involved in this aggression. The occupiers’ death toll is already more than 30,000 soldiers. That&#x27;s greater than the death toll of the Soviet Union in 10 years of war in Afghanistan. Greater than Russia’s death toll in two Chechen wars. But this does not stop Russia. This state is still ready to lose and kill, kill people. Because only one person in Russia doesn’t want to let us stay what we are. The Russian army has already destroyed almost the entire Donbas. This once one of the most powerful industrial centers in Europe is simply devastated. The occupiers are destroying it city after city. Just look at the city of Mariupol. There were half a million people, ordinary peaceful life in an important industrial city. Now there are burnt out ruins. And we still don&#x27;t even know exactly how many of our people were killed by the occupiers. At least tens of thousands - tens of thousands in a little less than 100 days. This is what it means, in fact, to characterize this war as full-scale. And that is why we are so loud urging the world to support us. First of all, calling for defense support. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine has shown extraordinary bravery. We did not surrender to Russia. We have stopped and are gradually pushing the army of invaders, which was recently considered the second strongest in the world, out of our territory. Nobody expected Ukrainians to have courage of this magnitude. But this magnitude is there. And this quality of our character, our willingness to fight for freedom and for our values - and these are the common values of all free Europeans - is now based on the support we have received from our partners. I am very grateful to you, the authorities and the people of Luxembourg, for the historic decision to provide Ukraine with weapons. Unlike other states, Luxembourg does not have large military depots or significant defense industry. But you have shown solidarity on the scale of a great nation and provided defense assistance in a timely manner - how important it is - and without excessive bureaucracy, as befits people with a great soul. You have proven that your potential is stronger than that of some who have remained weak even despite a much larger geographical scale. I am also grateful to you for participating in the sanctions pressure on Russia. Only together can all democracies ensure that Russia is satisfied with the scale of its own territory and never encroaches on the lives of other countries. We understand that no one will be able to stay away and avoid being affected when a catastrophe of such enormity occurs in the world because of the Russian state. It is reminiscent of World War II, when Nazi aggression threatened the lives of entire nations. Therefore, we must significantly increase the pressure on Russia to stop this catastrophe and prevent such aggressions in the future. We need more weapons for Ukraine - modern weapons that will ensure the superiority of our state over Russia in this war not only through courage, intelligence, but also technologically. And I ask you to advocate this need before other European states. More sanctions on Russia are needed for the war. As soon as the sixth sanction package is imposed, we should all prepare the seventh. All Russian officials working for the war and all Russian judges working for repression must be subject to the sanctions. The assets of these and other persons, both individuals and legal entities, subject to sanctions, as well as the assets of the Russian state in foreign jurisdictions must be frozen. All of them. And we need to find a legal way to confiscate them in order to compensate for the damage that Russia has done to the victims of the war. That will be fair. And - instructive for the aggressor. We must show that European unity outweighs any doubt about Europe&#x27;s ability to defend its values. Ukraine has de facto become part of the European Union. We are already cooperating both bilaterally and at the EU level on a scale commensurate with full membership. What can prove this better than the fact that we protect each other? And I believe that your country - as one of the founders of a united Europe - will support first the candidacy for Ukraine, and later the membership in the European Union. I am sure that your specialists and companies will join the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. And this will be the largest economic project in Europe of our generation. Luxembourg&#x27;s investment and technological potential and ability to organize a comfortable city life are well known. And I believe that we will see how your potential will work in Ukraine for the benefit of both our nations. Mr. Prime Minister! I invite you to visit our capital, Kyiv, so that we can discuss our further cooperation in detail. We will be glad to hear your speech in our parliament - in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! I want to recall these words again: &quot;We want to stay what we are.&quot; Right now, Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine is crucial for the whole of Europe as well. This is a war for values. When we win this war, all Europeans will be able to continue to enjoy their freedom. But if the person who wants to destroy any freedom in Ukraine and Europe prevails, there will be a dark time for everyone on the continent. One that has already been in the history of Europe, which has brought the continent a lot of suffering and victims. And an echo of which can still be heard sometimes today, unfortunately, in the voices of those who are trying to undermine European unity. Tyranny must lose. So that Europe can stay what it is. What it is now. Free, open, united and able to be strong in diversity. And I am grateful to you for the fact that the Grand Duchy is truly defending freedom with us. Thank you all! Thank you Luxembourg! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>President of Ukraine at the GLOBSEC International Security Forum in Bratislava: We must respond to all the challenges and dangers that Russia has created against us </h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-02</span></div>
  <p>Good afternoon! Thank you very much for this opportunity! Mrs. President Čaputová! Mrs. President von der Leyen! Mr. Prime Minister Heger! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear friends! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. This year, for the first time in its history, the Bratislava Forum is organized in such a way that its panels will be held not only on land, but also on water. On a ship on the Danube. And it seems to me that this image is important. Because today discussing the challenges to European security and stability, the threats to all humanity in a comprehensive way is simply impossible without taking into account everything that is happening on water. One of the most important targets for the Russian army in Ukraine today is bridges across rivers. There are occasions when the Russian army strikes missiles three times at the same bridge to completely destroy it. It is impossible to overestimate the threat that Russian aggression has created for the water potential of our entire part of Europe - the center and east, the Black Sea basin. The nature of the fighting of the Russian army is frankly barbaric. They just destroy absolutely everything. Both residential buildings and industrial enterprises are being brutally bombed. In particular, environmentally hazardous chemical plants, metallurgical plants, etc. Fighting in Donbas has created a threat of groundwater pollution since 2014. If the flooding of coal mines in Donbas continues - among them, for example, the Yunkom mine, where an underground nuclear explosion took place in 1979 - poison and even radioactive contamination can get not only into the rivers of Ukraine, but also into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Of course, speaking about the security challenges associated with our waters - the waters of rivers, the waters of the seas, it is impossible to avoid the blockade of Ukrainian ports by the Russian Federation. Because of this act of aggression by the Russian state, the world is on the brink of a food crisis. And it&#x27;s not just a food problem. This is a shortage in the market. This is a catastrophic rise in prices for basic products. This is a threat of hunger for tens of millions of people in different countries. If this is not prevented, we will get the problem of political chaos in some countries in Africa and Asia. Consequently, the migrant crisis in Europe, when people from countries suffering from hunger will seek salvation. Also, the food crisis will inevitably lead to large-scale protests in European countries. Many governments will have to explain to protesters on the streets of various European cities why our continent has been taken hostage by one state - Russia - and one person - in Moscow - who ordered the naval blockade of Ukraine. And now I have mentioned only a few consequences and only in one area of many in which we have extreme threats. Extraordinary challenges. How should we respond to all this? Ladies and Gentlemen! Let&#x27;s remember the Danube River again. It equally enriches different nations and different cities. Bratislava, Vienna, Budapest, Linz, Regensburg, Belgrade, Izmail and others. Slovakia, Austria, Germany, Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Moldova and Ukraine. For the Danube to remain clean and safe, for its economic potential, including transport, to work in full, the cooperation of all countries to which nature has given this river is needed. Therefore, unity is needed. Mutual understanding is needed. We need the ability to speak and negotiate for the common good. And these, by the way, are the key things for a peaceful and free life in Europe. This is what Slovakia can do. This is what Ukraine can do. This is what other partner states can do. And this is what Russia deliberately ignores. Does it try to hear someone? Understand? No. Does Russia recognize common interests? No. It sees only its own, and treats them quite specifically. Not as the interests of the entire Russian people, but as the selfish desires of a handful of state owners. And how does Russia perceive the very concept of unity? Only as an attempt to subdue others, to make them dependent on it, to destroy their identity. This is how they interpret unity - when the other and any diversity is simply destroyed. And this is exactly what they are doing on the territory of Ukraine. They are trying not just to kill people, but to erase the very fact that there is our state, that there is Ukraine. And that Ukraine seeks to be a full-fledged part of a united Europe. This is an openly anti-European policy of Russia. And such a policy obliges Europe to react, to react in a principled manner. First, to support Ukraine even more actively. With weapons, finances, politically. We are grateful for the help we already receive. To everyone who helps us. But arms supplies need to be increased. Because it is on the battlefield in Ukraine that it is decided whether freedom in Europe will be preserved for all nations without exception. And right now on the battlefield in Ukraine is a situation that could provide a turning point in the confrontation. Right now, these days, when Russia will lose the war against Ukraine, the freedom of Europeans will win for decades to come. Secondly, these are sanctions. The main purpose of the European Union&#x27;s sanctions packages is not just to harm Russia, but to make Europe independent of Russia, to sever all critical ties between Russia and European countries that Moscow uses as a weapon, including the energy one. That is why I consider it unacceptable when so much time is spent discussing the sanctions package, in particular the sixth one. These are all our people, these are all our days. More than a month! Of course, it is good that the sixth sanctions package has finally been agreed. But it must start working immediately so that it is possible to move on to the preparation of the seventh sanctions package. Every remaining link between Europe and Russia is a rope that the Russian state will try to turn into a stranglehold. Thirdly, we must strengthen the unity of Europe, true unity. And the main step in this direction should be to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, and subsequently full membership. There can be no temptation in Russia to assume that European countries will not support Ukraine in this matter. Because if Russia feels that Europe is weak and can leave Ukraine without the obviously necessary decision on candidacy, it will be one of the biggest destabilizing factors for the continent during Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! We must respond to all the challenges and dangers that the Russian Federation has created against us. Politics, economics, military sphere, food, environment, migration - there is no area of our lives in which there is no catastrophe, crisis or threat of catastrophe or crisis due to Russia&#x27;s actions. The quality of our answers directly depends on only one thing - our unity. Any division in Europe is a chance, a chance for Russia. For it to continue its aggressive policy. I believe you are aware of this. So, I believe that we will be able to protect our continent and our people from everything that threatens us today. But we also have to think about tomorrow. About what will happen after the victory, together with you, we believe in our common victory over tyranny. That is why Ukraine is already working on a large-scale United 24 initiative. It is a system of tools that can, when fully built, protect not only our state, but also other nations from the threat of armed aggression, natural disasters and anything that can destroy lives. We aim to make sure that every state that needs help can receive it in 24 hours. Unfortunately, there is no such tool in the world today. Although it is obvious that there is a need for it. So, I urge you to familiarize yourself with how the first element of this future infrastructure works. Fundraising platform that allows you to accumulate funds from different sources for different needs, including defense, infrastructure, medical, social. Anyone without any bureaucracy can decide for themselves how to help a state in need. Gradually, we will add other tools to United 24. Diplomatic instruments, sanctions, technical tools - together with you. They will significantly upgrade the existing global security architecture. I am sure that the need to update it will also be one of the key topics of your discussions. So, pay attention to the Ukrainian proposals. And do not forget that the state, for which anything is a weapon or a way to aggression, is trying to destroy us all. Including your peaceful and beautiful Danube. Defend us! Defend yourself! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We have already started working on new sanctions packages against Russia, it will pay the full price for the destruction of the lives of neighbors - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-02</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! We have three important pieces of news. First, the European Union is gradually moving towards the implementation of the sixth sanctions package. Frankly, achieving this is very difficult. Because this sanctions package is primarily about oil. Finally, the world is giving up Russian oil. Moreover, other countries, which produce much better and lighter oil, are preparing to replace Russian supplies. Therefore, huge revenues are lost for the aggressor state in this sphere. Of course, Russia is constantly trying to counter this. It has long enjoyed the flow of petrodollars and does not want to be weaned off it. But it has to. It has to get used to the fact that a very painful reduction in income is an inevitable consequence of the war for its culprit, for the Russian state. The second piece of news is that the United States has confirmed at various levels that modern HIMARS are being sent to our country. These weapons will really help save the lives of our people and protect our land. I am grateful to President Biden, all our American friends, and the people of the United States for their support. We are looking forward to it. We also expect good news about the supply of weapons from other partners. For example, today we have a new package of defense aid from Sweden. I am very grateful to the leadership of this state. We are working to bring the supply of modern combat systems to a much higher level. Third, more and more embassies resume their full-fledged activities in Kyiv. As of today, there are already 50 of them. This is very important not only in practice - for the work of diplomats, but also on a symbolic level. Every new embassy that returns to our capital is a testament to the faith in our victory. Faith that Ukraine will be able to defend its statehood in this war unleashed on our land by the Russian Federation. A new and, I think, very important and beautiful tradition was launched today. From now on, the ceremony of presenting credentials by ambassadors of foreign countries who start their mission in Ukraine will take place not just in Kyiv, but on the territory of our St. Sophia Cathedral. And the first ambassadors that presented credentials today in such a new ceremony were the ambassadors of Moldova, India and the United States. Why there? Why in Sophia? Because it is the sacred, historical and statehood center of our people. Receiving the credentials of the ambassadors there, we demonstrate who the Ukrainians are, what we are and what is behind us. We hereby express our highest respect to the representatives of other nations. We open up to them. And at the same time we show that we expect from them the same respect, the same sincerity to the Ukrainian people, to our interests and to our history. Immediately after the ceremony, I spoke with the new ambassadors. Impressions are good. I hope for productive work. Today there were two important addresses: to the Luxembourg Parliament and to the participants of the Security Forum in Bratislava, which was attended by President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and other friends and partners of our country. Of course, the key task is still to accumulate maximum support for Ukraine. First of all defensive, financial and, of course, political. Almost every address leads to increased assistance to our state. It is very important that now - in a few weeks - we are waiting for the answer of the European Union on the issue of candidate status for Ukraine. We are very much looking forward to it. And I am grateful to all those who have already spoken in support of our state, in support of the candidacy. In particular, in response to my requests in appeals to the parliaments of different countries, forums, student and expert communities, people in the squares of various European cities who rallied in support of Ukraine, in support of our people. We must understand that Russia has now mobilized all its forces to thwart Ukraine&#x27;s European movement. And every tool - especially public debates and appeals - must be fully used. The situation in Donbas has not changed significantly in a day. We had some success in the battles in Severodonetsk. But it&#x27;s too early to tell. The situation there is the hardest now. Just as in the cities and communities nearby - Lysychansk, Bakhmut and others. Many cities are facing a powerful Russian attack. The Russian army uses all its armed capabilities and does not count people at all. It is especially cynical that in the first line of the offensive the occupiers very often use those people who were recruited into their army in the previously occupied territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russian soldiers often simply hide behind these so-called mobilized. The longer the war lasts, the more vile, shameful and cynical things Russia inscribes in its history forever. Absolutely senseless shelling of our border northern regions, in particular Chernihiv, continues from the Russian territory. Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, the Kharkiv region were shelled. The entire temporarily occupied territory of our state is now a zone of total catastrophe, for which Russia is fully responsible. We have already started working on new sanctions packages against Russia. Step by step, we will deprive the Russian state of all the elements of the modern economy. The occupiers will pay the full price for destroying the lives of neighbors. And no lobby in any country will help Russia. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our defenders, our heroes. 223 combatants were awarded state awards, 72 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to each of our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>&quot;Peace&quot;, &quot;victory&quot;, &quot;Ukraine&quot; - three words we have been fighting for for a hundred days already after eight years - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-03</span></div>
  <p>Great people of great Ukraine! Exactly one hundred days ago we all woke up in a different reality. Exactly one hundred days ago, different us woke up. When Ukrainians are awakened not by the sun&#x27;s rays, but by the explosions of missiles that hit our homes, then completely different Ukrainians wake up. In 2014, Russia came to us with one word, with a new word. And this is the word &quot;war&quot;. On February 24, Russia added another word to it, making the phrase &quot;full-scale war.&quot; And during a hundred days we found or received, saw or wanted to erase other words. There are few of them. They are different. But they reflect what we have experienced. Among these words are some new to us. And those that were forgotten by our parents, but that we had to recall. Well known to everyone on the planet. And those that all people have to remember with horror. Painful words. And those that really give us hope. All of them are important. It will be right to recall them all today. One hundred days - one hundred words. First of all, these are two words: &quot;our heroes&quot;. First of all, people who have been defending our state since the night of February 24. And then - the Ukrainian words: &quot;palianytsia&quot;, &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, &quot;Stugna&quot;, &quot;Cossack&quot;, &quot;Zmiinyi&quot; and... Of course, &quot;Chornobaivka&quot; is a word that has sounded many times already and in which you can see everything about our resistance and about our enemies. And also - foreign words that have become native to Ukraine: &quot;Bayraktar&quot;, &quot;Harpoon&quot;, &quot;HIMARS&quot;, &quot;Starlink&quot;, &quot;Rzeszów&quot; and... Of course, &quot;Lend-Lease&quot; - another word, just one, but it reflects 100 days of struggle, 100 days of diplomacy, 100 days of support. And a word that reflects something important in our character. In the Ukrainian character. The “Javelins” that frightened the enemies because they did not expect the armor wouldn’t save them. And then caused a smile, our smile, when Ukrainians also painted &quot;Saint Javelin&quot;. Well, the word to which everyone in Ukraine raises a toast - &quot;Neptune&quot;. Every day we had words that are much more than just words for everyone now. Hard words. “Hostomel”, “Borodyanka”, “Okhtyrka”, “Chernihiv”, “Kharkiv”, “Kherson”, “Izyum”, “Melitopol”, “Mariupol” and “Azovstal”. And with them - &quot;army&quot;, &quot;artillery&quot;, &quot;Marines&quot;, &quot;border guards&quot;, &quot;intelligence&quot;, &quot;National Guards&quot;, &quot;police&quot;, &quot;territorial defense&quot;, &quot;aviation&quot;, &quot;our heroic pilots&quot;... And also the word &quot;ghost&quot;. The ghost of Kyiv. Who destroyed enemies and survived. We may not have heard all these words as many times in our lives as we have heard them in these hundred days. And every time we hear them, we know: they give us the time and opportunity to live as long as we are given. Given by God. Not by the enemy. &quot;God&quot; - this word, this appeal has been heard more than once. And always in a special way. There were also words that our enemy wanted to erase. &quot;Volnovakha&quot; and &quot;Saltivka&quot;, &quot;Popasna&quot; and &quot;Severodonetsk&quot;. These are words that we will definitely write again. But in our way. Just like &quot;Bucha&quot;. Just like &quot;Mariupol&quot;. And we will surely write them next to the word &quot;tribunal&quot;. For other words - &quot;filtration&quot;, &quot;deportation&quot;, &quot;torture&quot;, &quot;execution&quot;, &quot;carpet bombing&quot;, &quot;missile strike&quot; - to surely get an answer. Answer with just one word - &quot;justice&quot;. Justice that will become a full stop after the temporary words for us &quot;occupation&quot;, &quot;Mordor&quot;, &quot;orcs&quot;. Of course, they will leave our lexicon. We will definitely drive them out of our land. There were also words that gave hope and for which we fought particularly. &quot;Humanitarian corridors&quot;, which have become a road of life for hundreds of thousands of people and made it possible to overcome another word, the terrible word &quot;blockade&quot;. From the first day we have words the distance between which is as between darkness and light. We avoid one word. This word is “refugees”. And due to another word, we believe that millions of our people have a future. It will be at home, in Ukraine. This word is “displaced persons”. A lot has changed. When we hear the word &quot;Patron&quot;, we remember the most famous sapper of Ukraine. And when we hear: “marathon”, we understand that it is not about sports at all. And of course, a lot of deadly words have been added to our lexicon. The words no Ukrainian ever wanted to see. And the words a normal person cannot be proud of. &quot;Iskander&quot;, &quot;Kalibr&quot;, &quot;Solntsepyok&quot;, &quot;phosphorus bombs&quot; and more. For some reason we did not see their vaunted Armata tank. I think they were afraid of our new phrase: “tractor troops”. And one more phrase is worth mentioning: &quot;the second army of the world&quot;. At first it looked threatening. Then it was dangerous. After Bucha - it caused disgust. And now - only a bitter smile. Because what&#x27;s left of it? Of the army, which was called the second army in the world... War crimes, disgrace and hatred. And - numbers instead of words. When you see the number of killed every morning. The number of wounded. The number of shelling occasions. The number of missiles. When next to the word “children” there is a new number every morning. Today - 261. Already 261 children were killed by the Russian invasion. For what? There are no words that can answer this question. Words have appeared that are now very common. Which sound daily. But we must make sure that for our children they no longer mean what they mean to us today. So that they can perceive them only as history. First of all, it is the word &quot;ruins&quot;. But also - siren, air alarm, curfew, checkpoint, barbed wire. And the word - mines. There will be many more words that everyone will know. Which will make sense for everyone. And which will give a chance to millions. These are the words - reconstruction, candidacy and membership, guarantees and security. And definitely the word &quot;return&quot;. Of course, based on the word that was a dream, but will become a reality - &quot;liberation&quot;. These are the words of our future! These are the words about what we will do to our red viburnum, to our glorious Ukraine. The words about where the enemy warship is heading and will always head. About what to do with the occupiers when someone says: &quot;Vova!&quot;. And of course - our folklore already - &quot;Good evening! We are from Ukraine!&quot;. From Ukraine, where the field is blooming, but her hair is getting gray. From Ukraine that stands and will stand. Ukraine, whose glory and freedom have not yet perished. Ukraine, to which we say - glory! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the nation! And everyone knows the next phrase: &quot;Death to the enemies!&quot; Because there are three words we have been fighting for for a hundred days already after eight years: peace, victory, Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Don&#x27;t help Russia justify itself and don&#x27;t let the murderers call you their brothers and sisters - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the 90th annual meeting of the US Conference of Mayors</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-04</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Mayors of the United States of America! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today. The United States has become a true leader in Ukraine&#x27;s international support. This is defense, financial and political support. And it is based on a sincere connection between all nations who equally value freedom. On the fact that we, Ukrainians and Americans, equally understand the dangers of tyranny. The world has seen various tyrannies. At different times. Under different flags. And all of them are united by the fact that they despise the rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Tyrants do not recognize the rights and freedoms of local government. And it is usually the free people in the cities which still choose freedom that put an end to the history of tyrants. And to put an end to this, tyrants must not be allowed to enjoy ties to the free world. Any ties. You know that dozens of American cities maintain the so-called &quot;brotherhood&quot; with the cities of the Russian Federation. Chicago and Moscow. Jacksonville and Murmansk. San Diego - Vladivostok. Albany and Tula. What do these connections give you? Probably nothing. But they give Russia the opportunity to say that it is not isolated, even after beginning such a war. Each of you sees how the Russian army wages war and what it is doing to the peaceful cities of Ukraine. Its cruelty is no different from the tyrannies of earlier times. Mariupol was a port city, an industrial center with half a million people. Russia simply destroyed it. There is nothing there but ruins. Just as the city of Volnovakha and dozens of other cities that the Russian army burns daily. Burns with bombs, missiles, artillery. Just imagine - since February 24, Russia has used almost 2,500 different missiles against Ukraine. The vast majority of them were aimed at cities. At city infrastructure. And some of the most deadly Russian missiles are designed and manufactured in Yekaterinburg. Which, by the way, is still a sister city of San Jose. I&#x27;m sure many of you have seen and heard what Russian soldiers did in our city of Bucha. Mass killings, torture of people. The bodies of the killed locals laid on the streets while Russian soldiers remained in the city. One of those Russian brigades that did all this against our people in Bucha was a brigade from the Khabarovsk Krai of Russia. And the capital of this region - the city of Khabarovsk is still a sister city of Portland. What for? I leave you this question. Now, in order to restore normal life in Bucha and in the Bucha community, almost 2,000 buildings need to be rebuilt. You understand better than anyone else what this means for any city, when 2,000 houses are destroyed or damaged by missiles and hostilities. These are ordinary houses, ordinary schools, sports facilities, medical institutions. In total, as of February 24, 3,620 settlements in Ukraine faced Russian occupation - both large cities and small towns. In each of them there is destruction. Many of them are simply not suitable for civilized life. This is the reality that Russia has brought. When there is no connection in cities, there is no electricity, there is simply no water. When bombs and missiles can destroy any building - even a kindergarten or university. When the whole city can just be burned. But I believe that Ukraine will be able to defend freedom, and tyranny will definitely lose. People will again be able to live peacefully and safely in Ukrainian cities. And to make it happen faster, we have planned an ambitious project to rebuild Ukraine after this war. I invite you - your cities, your companies, your business and professionals - to take part in this project. You can also become the people who choose to defend freedom and thus put an end to the history of tyranny. Thanks to the leadership of the United States and the support of all our partners, Ukraine&#x27;s bravery receives the necessary weapons to fight for freedom. But the economic advantage of a free world must also be demonstrated. That is why we are already inviting our partners to join the reconstruction of Ukraine. Take patronage over a city, region, or industry that has been destroyed by Russian strikes. And rebuild them with the latest technology. This may be the largest economic project of our time, which will strengthen Ukraine, each country and each company that will participate in the post-war reconstruction. You can join the implementation of this great project. This will definitely mean economic growth, innovation and new social opportunities for both our country and your cities. Ladies and Gentlemen! The beginning of the annual Conference of Mayors of the United States this year coincided with the 100th day of Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against Ukraine. There are many issues on your agenda that concern the internal life of your country, your cities and communities. But remember - the full-scale war in Europe and the destabilization of world markets, which occurred because of Russia, directly affect the lives of every nation and all cities of the free world. Therefore, call for even more pressure on Russia. Don&#x27;t help it justify itself. Don&#x27;t maintain ties with it. And please do not allow those who have become murderers to call you their brothers and sisters. Help Ukraine. Help even more. Participate in the reconstruction of our cities, our communities that are liberated from the occupiers. Thank you very much for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the presentation of the United24 platform in Washington</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-04</span></div>
  <p>Greetings, Washington! Today is the hundredth day of Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against us, against Ukraine. I want to tell you a story so that you understand what this war means to us. I want to tell you about Svitlana Klymenko, a nurse at a hospital in the town of Ivankiv near our capital. On February 24, the first day of Russian invasion, Svitlana lost her husband. He worked as a paramedic and went out on a call in the area where Russian troops tried to advance on Kyiv. Since then, the first day of the war, he has been regarded as missing. The war also took away Svitlana&#x27;s other closest person, her son. He perished in Mariupol. Svitlana spent over a month under occupation until her town Ivankiv was liberated from Russian occupiers. Despite the pain of loss, she didn’t give up. She was doing her job. Just her job. Throughout the occupation, she worked at Ivankiv hospital and helped to save people. When I met her recently, she told me that it had been this work that had helped her make it through this. Saving others became her own life’s purpose. Svitlana continues working to this day. Like thousands of doctors and nurses, who have been rescuing people since February 24: children, women, and the elderly, because Russia does not spare anyone. We must do everything we can to support them. So that they have something and somewhere to treat patients and where to treat them as well as armored ambulances, safe from Russian troops, who are shooting them. The Russian army is ruthless. They are not only trying to kill as many people as possible but also to destroy all the infrastructure required for living. Bridges and roads, houses and hospitals, schools and factories. Burned-out cities, universities, and maternity hospitals, destroyed by missiles. Ruins are all that is left behind by the Russians. But people need to have somewhere to return. Right now. Today. That is the reason I initiated the special United24 platform. It is not just fundraising. It is also one of the ways to prove to Russia that evil will not win. Thousands of wounded need help. Thousands of objects need to be restored. Ladies and gentlemen, you can join in. How – is entirely up to you. Rebuild the bridge to Irpin, whose photos have attracted worldwide attention, or buy medical equipment that will help Svitlana Klymenko and her colleagues save many, many lives. Your help will be transferred fast and used as effectively and transparently as possible. We guarantee that thanks to these donations your names will forever go down in the history of Ukraine, the history of defending freedom and democracy. Please join United24 today. Thank you, everyone! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russian army can stop killing if one person in Moscow gives such an order, and the absence of such an order is a humiliation for the whole world - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-04</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! On this day, the 101st day of the full-scale war, the Skete of All Saints burned down in the Svyatohirsk Lavra in the Donetsk region. It caught fire as a result of Russian artillery shelling. Not the first shelling of the Lavra. Three Lavra monks were killed by the Russian shelling on Wednesday. Worship services are forced to be held in the basement. The roar of artillery and the &quot;arrivals&quot; of Russian shells are constant in the Lavra. And this is one of the three Lavras of Ukraine. This is the Lavra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is still considered in Moscow to be connected with the Russian Orthodox Church. Even this does not stop the Russian army. They are ready to burn everything: Orthodox churches just like anything else in Ukraine. During the full-scale war, 113 churches have already been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. Among them are the ancient ones - those that withstood World War II, but did not withstand the Russian occupation. There are also those that were built after 1991. Reconstruction of the Skete of All Saints of the Svyatohirsk Lavra began in 2001. June 10 would be another anniversary of the beginning of construction. I was interested in what Russian propagandists would say about the destruction of the skete. But, in fact, nothing interesting. They are very predictable. Ukrainians are accused of arson. Although the monks and laity in Svyatohirya saw perfectly that it was Russian artillery. I believe that this lie of the propagandists, this shelling, and the support of the Orthodox hierarchs in Russia for the aggression against Ukraine - all this should motivate the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to draw conclusions. More decisive conclusions and a clear condemnation of each of those who condone aggression. Ukrainian diplomats will do everything to make everyone in the world aware of this another crime of the occupiers. Russia is deliberately and systematically destroying Ukraine&#x27;s cultural and historical heritage, as well as social infrastructure, housing, and everything necessary for normal life. A state that does this cannot be a member of UNESCO and cannot remain at the UN as if nothing had happened. The UN Charter does not provide any rights for terrorists, and UNESCO is not a place for barbarians. Russian troops again fired at the border areas of the Sumy region, Mykolaiv, cities and communities of the Zaporizhzhia region, Kharkiv region. The situation in Severodonetsk, where street fighting continues, remains extremely difficult. It is also difficult in Lysychansk, Marinka, Kurakhove, other cities and communities of Donbas. Constant air strikes, artillery and missile fire. As of this morning, the total number of various Russian missiles used against Ukraine is already 2,503. Our heroes hold their positions and do everything to inflict maximum losses on the enemy. I am grateful to each of our defenders who are approaching the day when Russia will have to leave Donbas alone. Today in our country the memory of children who died from Russian aggression was honored. Over the past day, the worst figure - the number of children killed - has not changed. 261 children. That&#x27;s how many Ukrainian children lost their lives because of Russia. But this is the official number. The more we learn about those who were buried in the occupied territories, the greater, unfortunately, may be the number of names on this list. It&#x27;s scary to read. Year of birth, place of residence, circumstances of death... All of them would be alive now if only one person in Moscow had not caused this catastrophe. This can no longer be fixed. Because this war is already going on. But the terrible consequences of this war can be stopped at any moment. The Russian army can stop burning churches. The Russian army can stop destroying cities. The Russian army can stop killing children. If the same person in Moscow just gives such an order. And the fact that there is still no such order is an obvious humiliation for the whole world. Eternal memory to all who died from the Russian invasion! Eternal glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine to the guests and participants of the Lithuanian National Film Award Sidabrinė gervė in Vilnius</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-05</span></div>
  <p>Greetings from Kyiv! I will start this address with a short yet very important quote. &quot;If we live in some world, we hear some songs or radio, we watch some movies - this is all that creates us, creates our mentality.&quot; These are the words of Mantas Kvedaravičius. He told them commenting on his film about Mariupol. A film with which he wanted to show how war affects the city. How war changes people. And these are seemingly simple words. But they are really about how it is determined what kind of life people have and what kind of people they are. Art itself, culture - in all its forms and in all their senses - shape people, educate them. Or vice versa - close them in the dark, in lies. And it can also be the responsibility of movies, books, songs and radio - everything we hear, see, read. That is why it is important to bear the truth. It is important to support art that is for life, not for those who want to destroy that life. Ukrainians will remember Mantas Kvedaravičius as a man who was just like that. He really deserves the Golden Swan. He valued life and always spoke out against what was life-threatening in his view - and that was a very attentive view. And I ask you to be just as attentive. So that you also support life. And remember Ukraine, Mariupol, and the fact that this war that took Mantas&#x27; life, Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine, must end. End as soon as possible. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine! Info. The Lithuanian National Film Award Sidabrinė gervė was held under the patronage of Prime Minister of the Republic of Lithuania Ingrida Šimonytė. The ceremony was broadcast live on Lithuanian national television. This year, the highest award of the ceremony - &quot;Golden Swan&quot; - was given for merits to Lithuanian documentary filmmaker Mantas Kvedaravičius, who died at the hands of the Russian occupiers in Mariupol.</p>

  <h2>Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy following the working trip to the Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-06</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, dear Ukrainians! Today, it&#x27;s the night address, so I will be brief. There was a lot of work. An endless day. I was in Zaporizhzhia, Zaporizhzhia region. Expressed support to our military and awarded the best. Heard the report. We were in positions. Had a meeting with the head of the regional state administration, the leadership of the local police, the Security Service, and some mayors of the temporarily occupied cities. Met with Mariupol residents, who managed to leave the city alive and with children. Here they were met by Khortytsia, humanely and warmly. Conditions - I saw - are temporary, but not bad. Understood their difficult questions. I think we will solve them. Each family has its own story. Most were without men. Someone&#x27;s husband went to war, someone’s is in captivity, someone’s, unfortunately, died. A tragedy. No home, no loved one. But we must live for the children. True heroes – they are among us. After that, together with the Head of the Office we headed east. We were in Lysychansk, we were in Soledar. I am proud of everyone whom I met, whom I shook hands with, with whom I communicated, whom I supported. We brought something to the military. I will not talk about it in detail. We also brought you something from them. It is important. We brought confidence. And strength. I wish them health. Low bow to their parents. I wish victory to all of us. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everyone should talk about what is happening in Ukraine so that the attention to our struggle for freedom is not decreased - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-06</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Good health to you! Today was a busy day. A day of important communication, important meetings. I congratulated the journalists on their professional holiday. During the war, the word &quot;holiday&quot; sounds very unnatural, but every year on this day, June 6, greetings are heard for the people on whom, of course, we all depend. On the information they spread. On the speed at which they work. Of course, we do not celebrate this year. But still, we congratulate them. We still note the contribution of journalists of Ukraine and all those on whom the work of the media depends: cameramen, engineers, editors, photographers, producers and everyone without whom broadcast is impossible and websites will not work. These are the people who keep the information front and to whom I am grateful for this on behalf of all of us, all Ukrainians. Today I awarded correspondents and media workers who are working on the battlefield now. I also presented awards to the relatives of those whose lives were taken by the war. 32 media workers have been killed since February 24. This list includes different biographies, different personal stories. And not only citizens of Ukraine. Today, during a special ceremony in the President&#x27;s Office, everyone was remembered. Their memory was honored with a moment of silence. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about our capabilities and key current dangers, especially in Donbas and in the southern regions of Ukraine. I am grateful to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for fully understanding our needs and for his willingness to provide Ukraine with the weapons we so desperately need to protect the lives of our people. I also spoke with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Of course, about defense support for Ukraine. This is a mandatory topic for each of my negotiations. And I am grateful to our partners who act quickly and do not postpone their decisions. I am grateful to Poland. The issue of candidate status for Ukraine was also discussed with Andrzej, which is a key political issue right now. We are waiting for the decision of the European Union on our application in the coming weeks. I believe that this will be a decision not only about Ukraine, but also about the entire European project. About whether it has a future as a really strong union. I am preparing for a new wave of appeals and communication with the political and expert communities of the world in order to guarantee our state the support we so desperately need. This is a constant process - the maintenance of attention, and it cannot be stopped for a single moment. And that applies to everyone, really. Every modern person is well aware of how the media works. It is very difficult to keep an eye on one topic for a long time. For the attention to Ukraine, to our struggle for freedom not to decrease, everyone must continue to talk about what is happening. Please share information. Support our needs. Of course, this primarily applies to journalists. And today, by the way, I want to wish them not to be locked on our internal Ukrainian context. The more we say about Ukraine in the world, the sooner we will be able to end the war and liberate our land. Of course, this applies to all representatives of the state and Ukrainian politics. Work for our defense - in unity and in full force. But do not forget that business, culture and ordinary people can also do a lot to keep Ukraine at the top of global attention. A simple example - today I was presented with postage stamps issued in Spain in support of Ukraine. It may seem that the postage stamp can’t change anything. But it is a symbol of the attention to our struggle that millions of people will see. Creating such symbols, encouraging the creation of such symbols, talking about Ukraine and encouraging talks about Ukraine - this is what will help us in negotiations with representatives of states on specific important assistance that Ukraine needs today. Our heroes hold their positions in Severodonetsk. Fierce street fights continue in the city. Lysychansk, Slovyansk, Bakhmut, Sviatohirya, Avdiivka, Kurakhove and other directions of Russian strikes are the hottest points of confrontation today. The Russian army is trying to use additional forces in the Donbas direction, but it is the 103rd day - and the Ukrainian Donbas stands. It stands firmly. We do everything for the defense in the Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv directions as well. I am grateful to everyone who endures the strong pressure of the occupiers and defends our state. 17,864 combatants have been awarded state awards of Ukraine since February 24. This number 100% demonstrates the scale of our people&#x27;s heroism that became the response to Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion. I signed a new decree today on awarding our military. 121 warriors were awarded, 32 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must prepare for the next heating season, which due to the aggression of the Russian Federation will be the most difficult since independence - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-07</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you! A brief report on the past day. There were many activities - both diplomatic and domestic. First, the government is setting up a headquarters to prepare for the next heating season. This decision was made as a result of a meeting I held today with both government officials and representatives of our largest state-owned energy companies and regulators. Prime Minister, Ministers of Energy, Economy, Minister for Communities and Territories Development, heads of Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Energoatom and the National Commission for State Regulation of Energy and Utilities. The relevant Deputy Head of the Office of the President was also present. Whatever the occupiers plan for themselves, we must prepare for the next winter - in our state, on our land, for all citizens. The issues of purchasing a sufficient amount of gas for the heating season, coal accumulation, and electricity production were discussed today. In the current situation due to Russia&#x27;s aggression, this will indeed be the most difficult winter of all the years of independence. But! Everything is alright. We must go through it so that our people feel the normal work of the state. At this time, we will not be selling our gas and coal abroad. All domestic production will be directed to the internal needs of our citizens. At the same time, we are doing everything we can to increase our electricity export capabilities. This will be made possible by the capacities available in Ukraine. And after the historical accession of our country to the unified energy network of Europe, such exports not only allow us to increase our foreign exchange earnings, but also directly influence the stabilization of the energy situation in neighboring countries, which reduce Russian energy consumption. Another important aspect is the repair program for thermal power plants, combined heat and power plants and boiler houses. In particular, for those who were damaged or completely destroyed by Russian strikes. Implementation of this program in the coming months is one of the top tasks for the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that I have set a very specific task for the government to do everything possible to ensure that gas and electricity tariffs do not change in the next heating season. People already face enough difficulties because of the war. This will be provided. Local authorities are responsible for tariffs for heat and hot water, and the same level of tariffs should be ensured at the local level in the winter of 2022-2023 as well. I also held a meeting on communication with the European Union and with individual EU member states on our application and candidate status. Diplomatic activity in this direction does not stop even for a day. I hear daily reports, including on the preparation of procedural decisions in the European Union. The team of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our diplomats, the team of the government in general - all, absolutely all are working to achieve a significant historical decision already in June, which we all expect. For its part, Ukraine has done all, absolutely all the necessary work for this. As they say in such cases: the ball is in the court of European structures, European countries. The frontline situation in Ukraine has not changed significantly over the past 24 hours. The absolutely heroic defense of Donbas continues. The hottest spots are the same. First of all, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna. It is felt, absolutely felt, that the occupiers did not believe that the resistance of our military would be so strong, and now they are trying to attract additional resources in the Donbas direction. Just as in the Kherson direction – new units are being transferred there to restrain our actions. But what&#x27;s the point for them? The majority of the occupying contingent is already well aware that they have no prospects in Ukraine. We hear this mood in the appropriate interceptions of conversations. This is the prevailing mood in the Russian army. We are free people. We are not your slaves. More than 31,000 Russian servicemen have already died in Ukraine. Since February 24, Russia has been paying almost 300 lives a day for a completely pointless war against Ukraine. And still the day will come when the number of losses, even for Russia, will exceed the permissible limit. We are actively working to raise funds to support our army and to rebuild Ukraine after hostilities. In the territories that are already de-occupied, we return electricity, gas, water supply, communications. It’s not easy, but we do it. Of course, much remains to be done. It is necessary to provide hospitals with equipment, carry out demining. And, of course, rebuild everything destroyed by the occupiers. One of the tools for this is the state fundraising platform UNITED24. In the first month alone, more than one and a half billion hryvnias have been raised with its help. And I am grateful to everyone who contributed to its creation, to its work. Today, Elina Svitolina, our famous and very successful tennis player, became the ambassador of UNITED24. Together with Andriy Shevchenko, the first UNITED24 ambassador, Elina will work to attract new support for our country. Everything for Ukraine. This way, working together, each of us will be able to return normal life to all territories to which our military has returned security. And another piece of news that can be reported now. Next week, a special &quot;Book of Torturers&quot; is planned to be launched - an information system that collects confirmed data on war criminals and criminals from the Russian army. I have repeatedly stressed that they will all be held accountable. And we are approaching this step by step. The creation of such an information system has been going on for some time already. These are specific facts about specific people who are guilty of specific violent crimes against Ukrainians. And such a &quot;Book of Torturers&quot; is one of the foundations of the responsibility of not only the direct perpetrators of war crimes - soldiers of the occupying army, but also their commanders. Those who gave orders. Those who made possible everything they did in Ukraine. In Bucha, in Mariupol, in all our cities, in all the communities they have reached. Everyone will be brought to justice. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by these occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who is bringing our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Political history always goes alongside economic one, and success can be common only - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address to the participants of Ukraine Virtual Investor Conference</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-08</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the invitation! Glad to be able to address you today. I know that business people will listen to me, not politicians, so I will be as specific as possible. So that both your time and my time are used to maximum advantage. Ukraine has been subjected to an unprovoked and extremely brutal full-scale attack on our land by the Russian Federation. This war has been going on for 105 days already. And we are waging this war in such a way that, I am sure, no one has any doubts about our victory anymore. It will definitely be achieved. And the more qualitative our cooperation is, the faster it will happen. I offer you to consider today two horizons of cooperation with Ukraine - short-term and long-term. Of course, you can join our success story. Join our victory. Just now. These are very simple, very transparent tools. The first tool is our United24 platform, a special fundraising platform with which we accumulate funds to restore life after hostilities. This is demining, this is the purchase of equipment for hospitals, humanitarian support. This is very important. Each contribution gives us the opportunity to see that Ukraine has one or another specific but true friend. Hence, we see who we will be grateful to. The second tool is Ukraine&#x27;s military bonds. Even now, during a full-scale war, we are demonstrating absolutely conscientious service of our debt. So, military bonds are a tool for you to support us in the fight for freedom and to make money. Make money for you. But I still want to pay more attention to the long-term horizon today. To the reasons why it will be profitable for you to cooperate with Ukraine not just now, but now and for many more years to come. I offer you to see it in the long run as they say. What exactly are these opportunities? I will name five main ones: Europe, IT, agriculture, green energy, localization of production. Ukraine is access to the entire market of the European Union. Duty free access. We are working to ensure the same access to the G7 markets. And this is our own market, one of the largest in our region. Ukraine is qualified hard-working specialists, one of the best in Europe. Ukraine is a space of digitization that gives simplicity, gives, most importantly, transparency to any relationship between person and state, between company and state. This is something you will not find today in most countries of the world. Ukraine is an IT sector that enjoys one of the most favorable legislations in the world - a special legislative regime &quot;Diia City&quot;. And I propose to move the headquarters of IT companies to Ukraine, to create joint service centers and R&amp;D centers. Ukraine is resilient institutions even during a full-scale invasion. Our banking system, finances, government agencies remain absolutely stable, working in spite of everything. Ukraine is an agricultural sector whose global significance has already been seen by all when Russia blocked our ports. It is our agricultural sector that is key to the markets of dozens of countries. It is really profitable to develop processing in Ukraine. Ukraine is industrial parks that provide special opportunities for any manufacturing enterprise. Huge potential in various industries, from aerospace to woodworking. Ukraine is rich in natural resources, from natural gas to lithium ores. And Ukraine is green energy, green fertilizers and green hydrogen. All this together is a guarantee of Europe&#x27;s future energy security when we replace Russia with its dirty fossil fuels. Ukraine is an ambitious program of post-war reconstruction, which will be the largest economic project in Europe of our time. All of these are priorities for me, so they can become priorities for you as well. Nowhere in the world will you find all these economic factors at once. They are only here, in Ukraine, and you can already join the work with them. And, of course, I understand that next to everything I say now, there is one word. And this is the word &quot;war&quot;. The war continues. But we withstood a powerful blow. We defend our territory. And we are moving towards one of the greatest military successes in Europe. We will win this war. And working with you, it will happen faster. Political history always goes alongside economic one, and when success is possible, it can be common only - both at the state level and at the business level. We offer you just such a success. Because we feel that our defense in this war and our work for the victory have shown everyone in the world that we really deserve success. I invite you to cooperate! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Battle for Severodonetsk is probably one of the most difficult during this war, and in particular the fate of Donbas is being decided there - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-08</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Exactly 10 years ago, this day marked the start of EURO 2012, the European Football Championship, which brought together all Ukrainians, Ukrainians and Poles, Ukrainians and the vast majority of Europeans. The opening ceremony was in Warsaw, the final ceremony was in our capital, Kyiv. The matches were hosted in different cities of our two countries and in particular in Donetsk, at the Donbas Arena. Only 10 years have passed - and it seems that it was in another world. Just today, the occupiers announced the absolutely crazy news that they are preparing to unite some football clubs from all occupied territories into one pseudo-championship - from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Melitopol, Crimea, and even part of Georgia. It&#x27;s just a mockery of the occupiers over people who remember everything well. 10 years ago our Donetsk was a strong, proud and developed city. And then Russia came. Brought ideas of just such an inadequate level. And now it is a ghost town that has lost most people, thousands of lives and absolutely all prospects. Only the return of Ukraine, which will definitely happen, only our flag and only Ukrainian law will mean a normal life for these territories, for these cities - again. The life that was there. Peaceful, safe, open to the world. And of course - new matches of world-class teams at the Donbas Arena. I am grateful to President of Poland Andrzej Duda, a friend of all Ukrainians, for the fact that he has now started a special trip to European countries to support the European perspective of our country. This June we are to get a decision on the candidacy. And all our friends, all our diplomats are now working for this, working in full. President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová was to go with Andrzej - such a joint initiative of the two leaders was planned. A positive COVID-19 test hindered it. Well, these are the conditions of our life now. I wish Zuzana a speedy recovery. I spoke today with German Chancellor Scholz. About the decision in favor of Ukraine on the candidacy as well, which, in fact, will be a decision in favor of Europe. We talked about defense support. And about food security, guaranteeing which is really a global interest already. Because no one can be interested, except the Russian state, in the global food crisis. I addressed today the participants of the investment conference organized to discuss the economic prospects of our state. Representatives of the world&#x27;s largest funds were among the participants. Although the event was not public, it was still very important and powerful. I invited them to invest in Ukraine. Invest. I also talked to members of the community of leaders of major American companies. This is the 133rd such summit, and this year it brought together the leading forces of global business. We discussed how business can help Ukraine withstand. I urged them to leave the Russian market and not to support this war with their taxes. It is very important for me to see that such an audience - and these, I emphasize again, are representatives of the most influential part of American business - believes that sanctions against Russia should be strengthened. Therefore, it would be right for politicians to hear this position. Leading business and the majority in American and European societies believe that there is still not enough pressure on the Russian Federation to end this war. According to the results of this day, the 105th day of the full-scale war, Severodonetsk remains the epicenter of the confrontation in Donbas. We defend our positions, inflict significant losses on the enemy. This is a very fierce battle, very difficult. Probably one of the most difficult throughout this war. I am grateful to everyone who defends this direction. In many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided there. I also signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 285 combatants were awarded state awards, 68 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to our heroes who defend the state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must use all our influence and leadership to protect freedom and ensure the defeat of tyranny - President of Ukraine during the TIME100 Gala</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-09</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and gentlemen! Greetings from Ukraine! And thank you for the opportunity to address you. When I learnt that I was named the most influential person of the year, I took it as a recognition of what all of our people are doing – all Ukrainians who are defending the freedom and independence of our state. And I am honored to be a leader, above all, for these people. Besides myself, this year’s top five features Elon Musk, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, medical workers who fought with COVID, and President of the United States Joe Biden. This ranking of the most influential is made at a time when Europe is experiencing the worst war in 77 years. The war we cannot stop yet. Why so? Why cannot we stop the bloodshed? Why is our influence not working at full capacity? And why is a person who is not on our list at all holding millions of people hostage? I believe you will agree that these questions are now literally hanging in the air. But do you have the answers? The runner-up of our top list is Elon Musk. A man who launches rockets into space and knows how to amaze the world. A man who pushes the boundaries of the possible for both intelligence and technology. But the opinions of world leaders are not focused on Elon. Not on his rockets, which ensure progress in life. Opinions of world leaders are dedicated to those who launch rockets at civilians and destroy lives. In 105 days of the full-scale war, Russia has used about 2,600 different missiles against Ukrainian cities, most of them against civilian facilities: enterprises, railways, bridges, universities, even residential buildings. One of such rockets killed three people in our city of Odesa at once: a three-month-old girl named Kira, her mother and grandmother. Three generations of one family. Kira was only a month old when Russia started a full-blown war. What did she see in her life? And what did her assassination add to Russia’s influence? At the beginning of this war, I spoke with Elon. He asked me what he could do to help. And help he did. Thanks to his technologies, we can provide our people with a stable connection even when Russian missiles destroy all infrastructure. But are there any world leaders who are worried about whether or not Elon will pick up the phone when they call him? Or, those worried whether he will accept them? Are there leaders who think about how long the table will be when Elon Musk sits down to talk to them? So what does the influence really give? What rockets? Those that serve science? Or those that serve death? Something has definitely slipped out of control. Whether it&#x27;s our own influence, which we began to underestimate, or our attitude to leadership. Attitude to what it means to be a leader. I have so much respect for Boris Johnson. He is a true friend of Ukraine and a strong defender of freedom. But, unfortunately, not all depends on him whether millions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America will have food on their tables. It is the Russian fleet – not the British one or any other – that has blocked Ukraine’s Black Sea ports so that the world is on the brink of a terrible food crisis. And it&#x27;s not simply a price crisis. We cannot export our wheat, corn, vegetable oil and other products that have played a stabilizing role in the global market. This means that, unfortunately, dozens of countries may face a physical shortage of food. Millions of people may starve if Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea continues. We are constantly talking to Boris and other leaders on how to lift the Russian blockade of our ports. And how to restore the freedom of navigation – one of the basic freedoms for all humankind. But while we are looking for ways to protect freedom, another person is destroying it. Another person continues to blackmail the world with hunger. He is another in every sense of the word. Particularly, in the way this person is fighting for influence. And I have a question: why is this “otherness” still acceptable to certain leaders and countries? I leave this question to you. Because, in fact, everyone has to answer it – first of all, for themselves. To feel deep inside what is called values. Do they exist? It is only fair that the medical workers who fought against COVID have been noted this year in the Time vote. They really are the heroes of their time. And with their conscientious work, they have encouraged the whole world to unite. Finally to unite. At first, people in different countries thought that it was enough to just close the borders and provide themselves – themselves first – with the vaccine. But later it became clear that COVID-19 has no borders and cannot be dealt with only within national borders. Even the most advanced healthcare systems were not ready for the virus. And, unfortunately, had to go through a grievous injustice, fighting with COVID-19 to find a vaccine. To agree on common rules of response, a global mechanism for the distribution of vaccines. Why is this happening again? Why is it so difficult again? Weapons and sanctions are also a vaccine. A vaccine against COVID-22 brought by Russia. Hatred is a virus, and it&#x27;s even more deadly than COVID-19. It is spread through propaganda. Thanks to the impunity for murderers. Thanks to Russian oil, which is still on the global market. Thanks to money that is still flowing between the global financial system and Russian banks. Thanks to the big companies, which still believe that there is still not enough blood on the money from the Russian market. Although tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced to flee their homes because of this war. When hatred knocks on your door, will you be ready? Will any face mask protect you from the Russian COVID-22? And why is the vaccine against it – weapons and sanctions – so difficult to get in sufficient quantities? Why do some countries pretend as if COVID-22 does not exist, just like conspiracy theorists for whom there was no COVID-19? Why do some people learn nothing even from blood and death? I am grateful to President Biden for uniting the free world when the Russian threat arose. Today we have different tools to respond. These are defense support for Ukraine, financial aid and political coordination among many countries. It is also the Lend-Lease, which brings back the meaning of the struggle for freedom that was relevant during World War II. Because the current threat is similar in scale. However, Russia’s war against Ukraine is still ongoing. And right now, as you are listening to my address, the Ukrainian military are dying on the battlefield. The Russian army is shelling our cities with artillery and aircraft. The list of children killed by Russian strikes since February 24 already includes more than two hundred and sixty names. And when will this end? In fact, this is the key question. But why is there still no answer? Why is our influence not enough for this? Are we cowards? No. Maybe we are missing something in our true strength? Maybe we are not using all the capacity of our influence and our leadership? And this is my question to the United States, both to the parties and to society; to both Democrats and Republicans; to the Congress and to the President. It is time to be one hundred percent influential. We can defeat tyranny. Indeed, every one of us – every one – is the leader of our time. We can reliably defend freedom. We can stop blackmail by a person who has no place on our list at all. If we are up to it, then we must do it. Because influence obliges us to do so. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world must remove everything that hinders cooperation and development, and Russian aggression is a key obstacle - speech by the President at the opening of the meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-09</span></div>
  <p>Mr. President of the Council of Ministers Mario Draghi! Mr. President! Macky Sall, Chairperson of the African Union, President of Senegal! Mr. Secretary-General Mathias Cormann! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am glad to have an opportunity to address you today. Today - when the world is in the midst of several global crises: the food crisis, the energy crisis and the crisis of values - I would use this very concept to describe a crisis that is often called geopolitical. Values. And I will explain later why this is so. A year ago - in the same summer time as now - when these three crises were being prepared, and were being prepared directly by Russia, the world did not want to see where it was heading. It did not want to see how much could depend on the development of the situation here in our part of Europe. Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine and, more broadly, Russia&#x27;s aggression against all the rules of life in Europe and the world have had dire consequences. Tens of thousands of people have been killed. Hundreds of cities and villages in Ukraine have been destroyed. About 12 million people in Ukraine have become displaced persons, reflecting the biggest migrant crisis in Europe since World War II. The Black Sea, which is one of the key routes for food exports, is blocked by the Russian navy. Hundreds of millions of people on different continents are on the brink of at least food shortages and at most famine for which Russia will be fully responsible. Europe is experiencing one of the most difficult energy situations in its history... And we do not yet know what other crises Russia is preparing for the free world. What will happen if the Russian army uses weapons of mass destruction? What will happen if as a result of Russian strikes a threat will emerge, for example, to drinking water sources in our region? Or a threat of radiation or chemical pollution of the Black Sea basin, and hence parts of the Mediterranean? When Ukraine warned the world about Russian preparations last year and stressed the need for tough preventive sanctions against Russia, so that Moscow would at least feel that any aggression would not go unpunished, the world did not hear us. When we said that Russia&#x27;s policy of energy conquering of Europe was aimed at creating problems not only for Ukraine - and our gas transportation system - but also for all Europeans, it was not fully perceived by some leaders in Europe itself. And when we warned that Russia&#x27;s aggressive actions to block free navigation in the Sea of Azov would lead to much greater negative consequences, many in the world simply did not want to believe it and openly said that it was allegedly impossible. But all this is not just possible. That&#x27;s what happened. And this is because Russia was not shown in time that the world can be tough when it comes to defending common interests. Basic interests - peace, security, freedom, free trade and predictability of life. Ladies and Gentlemen! For a long time, the world has not recognized the importance of Ukraine and the weight of our warnings. But Russia has always known that a few steps against our state, a few steps in our region - and the consequences will be felt on all continents. That is why Russia needs control over Ukraine. That is why it is the basic interest of the world now to help protect Ukraine. Russia&#x27;s war against our state must end as soon as possible so that the security of food supplies across the Black Sea can be guaranteed. Because it is Ukrainian agricultural exports that play a stabilizing role in the global market. And Russia must be held accountable for provoking a new wave of migration against Europe, using the people of both Africa and Asia simply as hostages. For this, long-term painful sanctions must be applied against Russia at the global level. There can also be no question of Russia&#x27;s continued membership in the FAO – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. What has Russia to do there if it is working for starvation of at least four hundred million and at most more than a billion people? We need to guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s long-term security as soon as possible so that we can guarantee Europe&#x27;s long-term energy security and replace Russian fossil fuels on our continent through green energy transformation and green hydrogen. And, of course, we need to start the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine as soon as possible to ensure that none of the environmental threats posed by Russia during the war against Ukraine hit our people and neighboring nations. The Ukrainian Donbas, which Russia is simply destroying with brutal missile, air and artillery strikes, has been one of the world&#x27;s most prominent industrial regions. And these are deep coal mines, metallurgical and chemical enterprises. Any hostilities in such a region - and even more so with the use of weapons now used by Russia - is a threat of pollution to a vast area. Threat of pollution of groundwater and rivers, and hence the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Just imagine the level of losses - for Europe and the world. Ladies and Gentlemen! At the beginning, I said that the world was in a crisis of values. In what way is it reflected? There are no such governments and countries, no international organizations that do not understand the global threats of Russian aggression. But there are governments, countries, and international organizations that believe they may sit out and not react to what is happening. This is a problem of values, not geopolitics. They talk about geopolitics when they don&#x27;t want to admit that they are giving up values. I am grateful to you for remaining principled. For the fact that you are really willing to defend values. Because it is on the basis of values that sustainable development and sustainability of progress are possible. This was the right decision - when you terminated all cooperation with Russia and stopped the process of Russia&#x27;s accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, when you closed the Organization&#x27;s office in Moscow. And this should be an example for other international organizations. We must continue to use all instruments of pressure on Russia, both at the level of international organizations and at the level of countries, to stop its aggressive policy. The world must remove everything that hinders cooperation and development, and Russian aggression is the first key obstacle, the first key threat. And I believe that in the near future we will be able to begin to use in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine all the experience of the OECD, which is based on the implementation of the historically significant Marshall Plan. I am grateful for the decision to open a regional office of the Organization in Kyiv, our capital. This is the recognition of the importance of our country, our region for global cooperation and development. And I hope, Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. Mathias, that very soon we will be able to meet with you in our Kyiv office - in the Kyiv office of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In the Ukrainian society there can be only those who defend our independence and those who work to ensure this defense - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-09</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! I have recently finished a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron. We talked primarily about defense support. Of course, this is a key topic. I informed Emmanuel about the situation on the frontline, about the possible development of confrontation in the coming days and weeks, about the intentions of the Russian occupiers and about our resistance. Of course, we talked in detail about Ukraine&#x27;s European perspective. We are preparing for a response to our application for candidacy. The issues of security guarantees for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe were also touched upon. I am grateful that we discussed this topic with the President of France. We continue our work. I also spoke today with the Prime Minister of Montenegro about the path of our countries to the European Union. In fact, we exchanged experience. We continue very active work in all the countries of the European Union on a daily basis, so that the situation regarding the candidacy for our country is equally perceived there - in the west, in the east, in the north and in the south of the European Union. Most Europeans support Ukraine&#x27;s integration. And if Europeans support it, politicians who are still skeptical in some countries should not oppose themselves to the people, society and the very course of European history. I addressed the participants of the ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It is one of the most influential international organizations in the world. They severed ties with Russia. But substantial decisions are also needed - we need concrete pressure on Russia for what it is doing, including the crisis it has provoked in the world food market. I held a very important meeting with government officials today. Economy, business, jobs. We discussed actions at three levels - what needs to be done right now, what we can do in the near future, no matter how difficult it is, and what we will definitely do after the war. The first is a program of special grants to support small and medium-sized businesses. What can already provide new jobs and a new tax base. The second is the development of our security sector in all its aspects. Both now and in the future. It is also a question of jobs, a question of professionalism and technologies. The security sector in Ukraine must become completely different from what it has been all these 30 years. From the state border to every street, to every school, to every infrastructure object - security must be 100% ensured. And the third aspect is industrial recovery and attracting investment to the state. Localization, industrial parks, support of the state order, attraction of modern technologies to Ukraine. Relevant state programs are being prepared. There are many discussions in Ukraine today about what the economic policy of the state should be both during the war and when we restore peace. I want to emphasize one detail. And this detail is fundamental. We have to get used to the fact that there can be only two parts of society - those who defend our independence and those who work in a way to ensure that defense. And this is not a question of one or another economic doctrine, not a question of one or another political position. We simply cannot afford to leave the shadow part of economic life in the country. Of course, I understand that in some of our regions now, any economic activity - official or nonofficial - is a matter of mere survival. But if we talk about the normal, stable and strong life of society, the work of the state, our defense, we must understand: there are those who serve, and there are those who provide with their work those who serve. So, this is official employment. This is the payment of taxes. This is the maximum expansion of economic opportunities in our country on legal grounds. And this is a complete modernization of state institutions. Everyone who works in Ukrainian politics, who influences the public debate, should realize that there will be no more shadow in the country. I am grateful to our communication workers, who today resumed television broadcasting in Kharkiv after the morning shelling literally within a day. Striking at TV centers, destroying communication channels, leaving people in isolation - these are the tactics of the occupiers, which they really cannot do without. Because openness and honesty are also weapons against everything that the Russian state brings. The frontline situation today is without significant changes. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and other cities in Donbas, which the occupiers now consider key targets, are holding on. We have a certain positive in the Zaporizhzhia region, where we manage to thwart the plans of the occupiers. We are gradually moving forward in the Kharkiv region, liberating our land. We are keeping defense in the Mykolaiv direction. I am grateful to all our defenders who made this possible. Thanks to which we have endured 106 days of full-scale war already. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <p>Dear Mr. Rasmussen! Dear attendees! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the opportunity to address you. Last year, at the Fourth Copenhagen Democracy Summit, the question arose as to where the frontline between freedom and oppression lies and how to protect freedom from authoritarianism. Well, this year we got the answer to this question not just in discussions, but on the battlefield. This year has shown that the state border of Ukraine is an actual line of confrontation. But between what and what? Just between freedom and oppression? Or just between democracy and authoritarianism? Yes, between them. But this confrontation can also be viewed from another point of view. It can be assessed not only in terms of political regimes or ideologies. It also needs to be looked at in terms of the ability to turn a word into action. This is the fundamental ability of any system - public, state, business. If this ability is not lacking, the system loses. Of course, we are all raised in cultures that value the word. And the democratic system is always based on the fact that the word matters. And I do not want to underestimate the importance of discussions, opinions, and positions. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it didn’t take much time for one system to turn words about a people that allegedly does not exist into brutal hostilities aimed at destroying that people. Or to turn the words that some territory is supposed to be part of another state into action to capture this territory. Can democratic systems help this nation that becomes a victim of aggression as quickly as tyranny starts aggression? Does the democratic world have the tools to defend this territory, which someone there has decided to seize, just as quickly? Last year, at a summit like this, such words could be the basis for an interesting discussion about the power of Europe and Russian tyranny. But this year we see that these are absolutely practical questions on which the fate of millions of people directly depends - and, in fact, not only in Ukraine. Because the Russian state is interested in a much larger territory than the sovereign territory of Ukraine, and Russia does not recognize the right to independent existence not only of the Ukrainian people. Ladies and Gentlemen! Let&#x27;s take a closer look at some words that have not yet turned into action. The word is always the basis of the law. This is always the basis of the treaty. Conventions, statutes, declarations and, of course, memoranda. During the Russian war against Ukraine alone - and it has been going on, I will remind you, not since February 24, but since 2014 - Russia has violated about four hundred different international treaties to which our states are parties. Here are just a few examples: UN Charter; UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; Corpus of conventions governing the laws and customs of war; International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict; UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. From key global documents we can move to fundamental ones for Europe. The Russian state violated: CSCE Final Act 1975; European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Statute of the Council of Europe. And we should all recall the Budapest Memorandum, the violation of which by Russia adds maximum cynicism to this picture. With this violation, Russia has put an end to the entire struggle for nuclear disarmament in the world. What is the point of talking about nuclear disarmament now that Ukraine, whose third-largest nuclear arsenal has been taken away, has been attacked by a state that was among those who signed a pledge to refrain from aggression and still remains a nuclear state? Democracy is always respect for words. International law is also respect for words. But they work and are able to win in confrontations only when they can be backed up by action. When a word literally means action. So, returning to the question of where the line of confrontation between freedom and oppression lies, it is worth saying that it also lies between the ability to simply say something and the willingness to act to reinforce certain words - promises to voters, words in negotiations and texts of conventions. On the Ukrainian border, in the Ukrainian Donbas, near Kharkiv, in the south of Ukraine, we can now see that the Ukrainian people are really ready to back up their words about independence with appropriate actions in defense of independence. But where is the frontier where it will be seen that Europe is also ready to back up all the words important for it with appropriate action? If polls show that 71 percent of Europeans consider Ukraine part of the European family, why are there still political skeptics who are hesitant to allow us to move to the European Union? If Europe&#x27;s core values imply that every nation has the same importance and should be equally respected, why have the Ukrainian people been told for so long that they must remain in the gray zone between the European Union and Russia? If Russia cynically violates literally all vital documents of international law, why are there still those who are hesitant to block any relations with such a state? These questions indicate, in fact, that the European system can lose if words are not backed up by action. A democratic system can lose even on our continent if there is no action. So, first of all, we need to finally remove this gray zone, which is so tempting for the Russian state. We need to move from words that Ukraine is part of the European family to action. In the coming weeks, the European Union can take a historic step that will prove that the words about the Ukrainian people&#x27;s belonging to the European family are not empty. Secondly, there is a need for effective, legally binding security guarantees in a renewed security architecture for the European continent. We are currently working on such a system of guarantees for Ukraine. And only when it appears can we say with confidence that the thousands of words on the pages of conventions, statutes, treaties and memoranda are not just words, but a reality backed up by action. We must also finally learn to act preventively. Not just to react, but to act as soon as words of aggression are heard. When it becomes clear that the war can start at any moment. The aggressor must feel the power of the democratic world, the power of international law as soon as he intends to violate the existing basic norms. And the third mandatory point is that all war criminals must always be held accountable. Justice must have its say. And the word of justice must be backed up by action. For every death inflicted in Ukraine by Russian soldiers, for every torture and rape, for every city destroyed, for the deportation of people and children, both those who did it directly and those Russian commanders and politicians who gave such orders must be held accountable. Democracy must be effective - in every sense. Europe must be effective. If words are said, if they were put on paper and became documents of international law, they must work. They must act. And when that happens, there will be no question of who will win and where this frontline is. Of course, democracy. Of course, Europe. And above all in the minds of leaders who must act, not just speak. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine is fighting for its future, Russia is fighting for someone else&#x27;s past, which is why we will win - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address to the student community of leading British universities</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-10</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear students, lecturers, professors, academics! 16 minutes 19 seconds. This is the record of The Boat Race. The legendary rowing competition on the Thames between Oxford and Cambridge. And the first Boat Race in history took place on this day, June 10, almost 200 years ago. Yes, it&#x27;s just a beautiful, symbolic fact, and I&#x27;ll be honest: it doesn&#x27;t do much for this speech. I could compare the present in Ukraine with a difficult boat race: against the current, waves and storm, where our state is &quot;steering&quot;, sails to freedom, opposes the Russian warship, and it is important for us to feel that we are not alone. That all the countries of the free world are in one boat. And Ukraine doesn’t have to send an SOS signal to everyone on the 107th day of the war! I could say more, but I&#x27;ll be honest: I don&#x27;t want this speech to last 16 minutes 19 seconds. Although, again, I&#x27;ll be honest: it had every chance to be such. Preparing for the meeting, I read a lot about the history and traditions of your educational institutions. To speak one language with you. To tell about the present of Ukraine very clearly and understandably for each and every one of you. For 107 days in a row, Ukraine and our people have heroically opposed Russian aggression. For many, our steadfastness has become a mystery and almost a miracle. Just as the Oxford Electric Bell and its design - it is still unknown exactly how it works. So is Ukraine, which for 107 days in a row has been continuously generating energy that resists the world&#x27;s second army and defending itself and Europe, and if Ukraine runs out of battery, this will be a real energy crisis on the planet. For 107 days in a row we have been passing the survival exam. Every day we seem to be passing the Cambridge Tripos. On a chair with three legs, under the roar of an air-raid siren. For 107 days in a row, Ukraine has been resisting barbarians, savages, dementors. The army of &quot;he-who-must-not-be-named&quot;, according to some politicians. Even more so it is inadmissible to refuse to buy oil, gas, etc. from him. For 107 days we have been facing the enemy who has not read one of the founders of the London School of Economics - Bernard Shaw. Who does not recognize the worldview that now that we have learned to fly the air like birds, swim under water like fish, we lack one thing – to learn to live on earth as human beings! The enemy who does not recognize the truth, for which the rector of the University of Birmingham, Nobel Peace Prize winner and architect of the League of Nations Robert Cecil fought. About the vital need for humanity to resolve conflicts not in the trenches, but at the table. The advantage of arguments, not missiles. For 107 days in a row, we have been opposing a state that is suffering from a new form of color blindness. It calls black white, and white black. It declares peaceful goals, but makes peaceful cities and villages its target, killing women and children, calling it self-defense. 80 years ago, Manchester survived the Christmas Blitz. This spring, the whole of Ukraine survived the Easter Blitz. 80 years ago, the Nazis razed Coventry. This year, the ruscists created dozens of new coventries in Ukraine. These are Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Kharkiv, Mariupol. For 107 days in a row, we have been opposing a nuclear power that deserves the wooden spoon for ignorance of international law and the Darwin Award for violating it. As you can see, I was completely honest when I said that I was seriously preparing for our conversation. Is irony and humor appropriate on my part in such times? It can’t be otherwise. Impossible. I could cite many more analogies, quote hundreds of worthy graduates of your universities, but honestly I’d rather ask: what do you know about us? Recently, students at the University of Edinburgh exposed their professor for spreading Russian propaganda and lies while lecturing on the war in Ukraine. Excuse me for the tautology. Such news, like hundreds of other signals we see and hear from you, testify to at least three things. You are not indifferent to the war in Ukraine, lies about this war are noticeable and disgusting, but the truth is known, necessary and important. At the same time, you know the truth about Ukraine and the war. You know about Ukraine because of the war. You read about the shelling of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Mariupol. But did you know that these cities are sister cities of Leeds, Birmingham, Liverpool? Have you heard of the Kyivan Letter? A document of the times of Ukraine-Rus’, which is more than 1000 years old, which is stored in the Cambridge Library? About Queen Margaret, the first Saint of Scotland, granddaughter of the Grand Duke of Kyiv Yaroslav the Wise. Have you heard about the founder of Donetsk - Welsh engineer John Hughes. Or about the founder of Luhansk - Scotsman Charles Gascoigne, who built the first coal mine in Ukraine. The point is not that we have common pages of history. I&#x27;m not trying to surprise anyone with this right now. The point is that this is perhaps the best description of the essence of the war that Russia is waging against us. Its goal is to erase our history, to erase our statehood, our identity, to deny our existence as such. To say that we never existed. That we are an artificially created people, as if we are not humans, but a variety of plants or a species of animals. To devalue our culture, to humiliate our language, to cross out our art. Our musicians, writers, philosophers, scientists, designers, inventors, all the great rulers and all the great warriors of Kyivan Rus’, Zaporizhzhian Sich, who existed, exist and will exist. Russia&#x27;s goal is to erase all associations about Ukraine except the war. Ukraine without the past, without the bright moments of the present, and therefore without the right to the future. Why, you may ask, is Russia doing this? Because it has a global phobia at the state level. This is a phobia of freedom. For them, this is an unfamiliar, unknown, and therefore very frightening force. Even if freedom is not in their country, but in a neighboring country. Freedom is nearby. For Russia, it is dangerously close. It wants to destroy it. But it will lose. We are fighting for our future, they are fighting for someone else&#x27;s past. But the time of such countries and rulers has passed. And our time is our time, this is the future. And this is an active voice. Real voice. Voice of truth, honor, wisdom and freedom. And let&#x27;s talk to you with this voice today! I do not want this speech to last 16 minutes 19 seconds. So let&#x27;s finally begin! And to be honest I will be very honest. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Now all Ukrainians must be a united nation that is fighting and doesn’t allow the world to divert attention away from the events in Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-10</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! A brief report on the passing day. By the way, it is the 107th day of our defense already. Very fierce fighting continues in Donbas. I repeat these names every day: Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Slovyansk, many, many others. I repeat them at meetings with the military, with diplomats, talking to representatives of partner countries. Russia wants to destroy every city in Donbas, “every” is not an exaggeration. Like Volnovakha, like Mariupol. All these ruins in once happy cities, black traces of fires, craters from explosions - this is all that Russia can give to its neighbors, Europe and the world. This is probably the fastest example of the complete degradation of any state - the path that the Russian state has covered in 107 days. The Ukrainian troops are doing everything to stop the offensive of the occupiers. As much as possible. As much as the heavy weapons, modern artillery - all that we have asked and continue to ask our partners for - allow them to. I met in Kyiv with Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace. We talked exactly about this – how to stop Russian aggression, how to deprive it of offensive potential, what other supplies are needed for our army. The Britons demonstrate true leadership in defense matters. I also addressed the British university community today and talked to students. I work at all levels so that the world can hear us and know what we need. There were many questions from students about what our life would be like after this war. About reconstruction, attracting leading experts, about the education system. Of course, we are preparing for a large-scale restoration of our state. Of course, we have already started reconstruction in the liberated territory. Of course, we will change a lot in our lives after this war. And it is good that the world is interested in details, they want to join, they are thinking how to find opportunities to work for Ukraine after our victory. But the battles are still going on. And right now, in these very difficult battles, it is being decided when this &quot;after&quot; will come. It is being decided at which frontiers we will finally break the plans of the occupiers. And everyone should remind societies in other countries of this. Of the battles that are going on now. Of the support that is needed now. It depends not only on politicians and diplomats. But also on journalists, activists, entrepreneurs, our displaced persons who are abroad. Now is the time that all Ukrainians must be one - a nation that is fighting and does not allow the world to divert its attention away from what is happening on the battlefield in Ukraine. I also addressed the participants of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit today. I spoke, in particular, about the response of the European Union, which we expect for our application for candidacy. I will emphasize again and again: this will be the EU&#x27;s response not only to Ukraine, but also to its own future - the future of the European project. I am grateful to the British Government, the World Bank and the Government of Canada for new steps in financial support for Ukraine. The day before, our country received 1.5 billion US dollars: one billion is the World Bank, another 500 million is Britain. Direct budget support. We will use it to pay salaries in the public sector. Canada, for its part, became the first country to send 1 billion Canadian dollars to our administrative account in the IMF. The Government of Ukraine has already started implementing the decisions discussed at this week&#x27;s meetings. A bill has been approved that will allow customs clearance of cars through the state service in &quot;Diia&quot;. The whole process of customs clearance will be fully transparent, convenient and immediately remove all the shadow schemes that were possible in previous years in this area. I hope that the people&#x27;s deputies of Ukraine will quickly vote for such a step. Also today, the government has already presented specific details of new state programs that should provide new jobs and support for business in this very difficult time for all of us. This applies in particular to non-repayable grants for micro-businesses and other special financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Despite all the pressure from Russia, despite all the Russian strikes, we will do everything to revive Ukraine&#x27;s economy, economic activity. In the evening I signed two decrees awarding our heroes. In total, 242 combatants were awarded, eight of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>On the battlefield in Ukraine, it is being decided what rules the world will live by - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Shangri-La Dialogue, the Asian Security Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-11</span></div>
  <p>Dear participants of the Shangri-La Dialogue forum! Ladies and Gentlemen! Mr. Director! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. When I was preparing for this meeting with you - so far a virtual meeting, but I hope for live meetings during my visits to your region after our victory in the war - so when I was preparing for this meeting, I was told about a girl. She wrote me a letter asking to support her initiative called Spray Paint Ukraine. This is an initiative to help Ukraine. She created this image, but an NFT image, and gave me this T-shirt so I could wear it, and thus help everyone know about her initiative. And I thought that this situation - this girl&#x27;s appeal, her idea, her confidence that the President of Ukraine can respond to her initiative, as well as the fact that I am really ready to help - will be important. I wore this T-shirt today. And this may help explain why Ukraine has gained such support in the world and why we will definitely win this war that Russia has started. Can you imagine, for example, the President of Russia, who would respond to the initiative of a girl from your country, to such an initiative? Who would just see a letter of appeal to the Embassy in Singapore to support the idea of a girl unknown to him and wear a T-shirt sent to him? I think this is impossible at all. And that&#x27;s what really happens. This is the confrontation between &quot;possible&quot;, which we and many others in the world need, and &quot;impossible&quot;, for which Russia is desperately fighting. Russia wants to make it impossible for a neighboring country, which it sees solely as its colony, to be able to exist freely, to exist independently. That is why the Russian army has already killed tens of thousands of our people, deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to its territory. Russia has already used 2,595 cruise missiles against us alone - and that&#x27;s in 108 days! Russia wants to make it impossible for our land, resources and water to be used in the interests of our people. It wants to steal all this, and is actively looting the territory it managed to occupy. Absolutely everything is taken from there - from cars left on the streets and in the yards to equipment of the seized factories, from scrap metal to grain. Just imagine the meanness of the Russian Federation if its representatives stole even a few trolleybuses from our city of Mariupol, which was completely destroyed by the Russian army. This is the &quot;great Russia&quot; - stealing trolleybuses. It wants to make it impossible for the nations of the world to be confident in the freedom of navigation. In this basic freedom for peace and prosperity in any region of the planet. From the first minutes of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia blocked our ports in the Black Sea using its fleet. During the war, the Russian military attacked, in particular, peaceful merchant ships, and also fired missiles at our port infrastructure. Today, the Black Sea is the most dangerous sea in the world. And this is solely Russia&#x27;s fault. Although on February 23 this year, on the eve of the war, free and safe navigation was possible in the Black Sea. I can cite such examples for a very long time - examples of what Russia wants to make impossible. I am sure that in many of these examples you will be able to see what is valuable to you. What makes your life the life you value. And I am convinced that you are all interested in the possible free and independent life of your nations, the preservation of your culture, your material and resource wealth. So that no one robs your property, so that your cultural treasures are not taken away. So that no enemy fleet can make your seas dangerous for navigation. Russian propaganda is trying hard to spread in your countries, as in many others, the disinformation thesis that Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine is allegedly something about NATO, about the role of America, about the West&#x27;s attempts to advance somewhere in Europe. But Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine is far from just about Europe. It&#x27;s about globally important things. The Russian leadership wants to reject all the achievements of human history, including the system of international law that we have today, and return to life as in the XIX century or even earlier. When everything that gave billions of people a chance for harmonious development and prosperity was impossible. That is why I want to remind you of the words of a man you all know well: &quot;If there was no international law and a big fish ate a small one and a small one ate a shrimp, we would not exist.&quot; These are the very wise words of Lee Kuan Yew, a leader who could see the real causes of many things and processes and who knew what should really be appreciated. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m in this T-shirt now, that&#x27;s why I responded to the request of a girl from Singapore. We must value our opportunities. We must appreciate what has been made possible by the wise leadership in the past, by the struggle of many generations of various nations. We must appreciate what gives us the chance to live in peace and work for the common good in our societies and in the world. Hence, we must stop Russia. We must stop the war that this state has started against my state, trying to return the world to the old days, when the freedom of nations and people&#x27;s lives did not matter. We must break the ability of Russia or any other country in the world to block the seas, to destroy the freedom of navigation. If sanctions, then sanctions. If mirror measures to limit the service of Russian ships in ports, then mirror measures. Russia must feel that its aggressive policy has consequences primarily for itself. And if this does not happen, if the Russian blockade prevents us from continuing to export our food, which the global market currently lacks, the world will face a severe food crisis and famine in many countries in Asia and Africa. Food shortages will inevitably be followed by political chaos, which could lead to the fall of many governments and disaster for many politicians. And you can already see how this catastrophe is approaching, just by looking at rising prices for basic products on the world market and in some countries. This is a direct consequence of Russia&#x27;s actions. Finally, we must return full force to international law. Since February 24, 287 children have died in Ukraine as a result of Russian strikes. And that&#x27;s just what we know officially. We do not yet know how many people were buried in mass graves in the occupied territories and how many bodies remained in the ruins of houses in cities still controlled by the Russian army. For murder and torture, for deportations, for destroyed cities, for the use of illicit munitions, including phosphorus bombs, for blackmail with chemical and nuclear weapons - for all this, any state, not just Russia, must be held accountable. And we can make it possible! If we act in a coordinated manner. Although Russia, of course, will try to make it impossible. We can ensure UN reform. So that all states abide by international law, so that no one violates the world order. The UN system and, in particular, the UN Security Council today do not provide a fair representation for most nations of the world. The voices of entire regions of the planet often cannot be heard when it is vital. If this reform had already taken place, we today would be able to respond to any aggression - not just that of Russia - at a truly global level. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful to you for supporting Ukraine. I am grateful to you for your attention to our state. But remember that this support and attention is not only for Ukraine, but also for yourself. For making your future secure. It is on the battlefield in Ukraine that it is being decided what rules the world will live by and what will be possible and what will be impossible. Let&#x27;s save the world from going back to the days when everything was decided on the basis of the so-called right of force, and individuals and any of their ideas, like many nations, simply did not matter. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The decision to grant Ukraine candidate status will strengthen not only our state, but also the entire EU - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-11</span></div>
  <p>I wish health to all Ukrainians and all our friends! The final phase of the big diplomatic marathon, which is to end in a week and a half, has started today. And in this marathon we are actually together with the European Union - in one team, and this team has to win. I am sure that we will soon receive an answer on the candidate status for Ukraine. I am convinced that this decision can strengthen not only our state, but also the entire European Union. What else needs to happen in Europe to make it clear to skeptics that the very fact of keeping Ukraine outside the European Union works against Europe? For example, everything is already obvious to the Russian occupiers. They say so when they torment our people that it is allegedly for the fact that Ukraine has gone to Europe. And why does Europe have skeptics then? We will continue to work even harder at all levels to get the right decision. It is very important for us. Very fruitful talks with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen were held in Kyiv today. I am pleased to note her sincerity. It is the European Commission that will prepare a conclusion regarding our application. Ukraine provided all the necessary answers in a very short time, and it was done well. There will be many more equally important and, I hope, fruitful talks with European leaders next week. I talked to the participants of a very representative security forum in Asia, in Singapore. High level. The event was attended by defense ministers and other high-ranking officials from dozens of countries of the region. We really need this region. And I felt that today my address was heard there, arguments were heard and perceived. News about the distribution of Russian passports in Kherson and the distribution of passports in Melitopol were actively spread in the occupied territories and in Russia. And I looked at who in this news was shown as Kherson and Melitopol residents who allegedly want Russian passports. A few collaborators and people from their entourage... Well, it looked like not a queue to get a passport, but an attempt to get a ticket to flee. Very demonstrative. The Ukrainian troops are gradually liberating the territory of the Kherson region. Today the village of Tavriis&#x27;ke has been added to the list of returned settlements of our state. There is certain success in the Zaporizhzhia region as well. Fierce street battles continue in Severodonetsk. I am proud of all our defenders who managed to stop the advance of these hostile people, these occupiers for many weeks already and keep our defense strong. Do you remember how Russia hoped to capture the entire Donbas in early May? It is already the 108th day of the war, it is already June. Donbas is holding on. The losses suffered by the occupiers, including in this area, are extremely significant. In total, the Russian army today has about 32,000 dead souls. For what? What did it give you, Russia? No one can say now how long this burning of souls by Russia will last. But we must do everything to make the occupiers regret that they have done all this, and to hold them accountable for every murder and every strike at our beautiful state. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the charity evening organized by CORE</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-12</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, CORE and all the participants of this charity evening! 107 days ago, Russia launched a full-scale war against us. All of you have heard about the horrors that Ukraine is going through. Tens of thousands of explosions and shots. Hundreds of thousands wounded and killed. Millions who have lost their homes. All of this is not a logline for a horror film. All of this is our reality. All of you have seen photos from Ukraine. Peaceful cities and villages wiped off the face of the earth. All of this is not the scenery of a blockbuster about the apocalypse. All of this is our reality. All of you have seen footage from Ukraine. Cruise missiles and bombs that raze schools, hospitals, theaters, museums, entire streets and neighborhoods to the ground. It is not VFX, not computer graphics. All of this is our reality. But definitely we will rebuild Ukraine. Streets and neighborhoods, peaceful cities and villages. We will heal bodies from wounds and souls from losses. All of this is not a synopsis of a fiction film. All of this is our reality and our future. And all of you can help us in this. During World War II, when all the metal was needed at the frontline, the Oscar statuette was made of plaster. It can fairly be said that this is a symbolic gesture that does not drastically affect the course of the war. But we cannot claim that the world would have defeated Nazism without a piece of metal. No. We do not know for sure. That is why we know that any help is valuable and important. I thank everyone who has come here today for the sake of this help – help for Ukraine. Mr. Sean Penn, who has been personally in Kyiv and Ukraine since the first day of the war and has seen firsthand this evil, which is called Russian full-scale aggression. You were ready to melt your Oscar in protest against the lack of support to Ukraine. I hope that this will not be necessary. Other metal must melt. Weapons of barbarians, which kill civilians, women, the elderly and small children, must melt. The aggressor’s equipment, its tanks, planes, ships, rockets and all other iron that brings evil must melt. We have been resisting it for 107 days in a row. We can stop it together. Support Ukraine because Ukraine supports the whole world. Fight for Ukraine because Ukraine is fighting for the whole world. For democracy. For freedom. For life! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>There are already 2606 affirmative answers to the question of whether Ukraine needs modern missile defense systems - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-12</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! After the missile strike at the Ternopil region, ten people are still in hospitals. There was no tactical or strategic sense in this strike, as in the vast majority of other Russian strikes. This is terror, just terror. Among the victims is a 12-year-old girl from Kharkiv. She went to the Ternopil region to flee from the Russian army. And such facts will now determine perception of Russia in the world. Not Peter I or Lev Tolstoy, but children wounded and killed by Russian strikes. Today is the 109th day of a full-scale war, but it is not the 109th day as we tell our partners a simple thing: Ukraine needs modern missile defense systems. The supply of such systems was possible this year, last year and even earlier. Did we get them? No. Do we need them? Yes. There have already been 2606 affirmative answers to this question in the form of various Russian cruise missiles that have hit Ukrainian cities. Our cities, our villages for the period from February 24. These are lives that could have been saved, these are tragedies that could have been prevented if Ukraine had been listened to. The key tactical goal of the occupiers has not changed. They are pressing in Severodonetsk, where very fierce fighting is going on - literally for every meter. And they are also pressing in the direction of Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Slovyansk and so on. The Russian army is trying to deploy reserve forces in Donbas. But what reserves can they have now? It seems that they will try to throw into battle poorly trained conscripts and those who were gathered by covert mobilization. Russian generals see their people simply as the cannon fodder they need to gain an advantage in numbers — in manpower, in military equipment. And this means only one thing: Russia can cross the line of 40,000 of its lost troops already in June. In no other war in many decades have they lost so much. I prepared an address to the American Jewish Committee. A global forum organized by the committee began in New York today. This is one of the most influential structures that helps promote decisions for our protection. I called on them to redouble their efforts so that we could get more modern weapons, more financial support for our state, so that we could end this war sooner. This week I will continue to address the parliaments of the partner countries, in particular the parliament of the Czech Republic. Many talks of various levels with European politicians are also planned. We work every day with the European Union on the candidate status for Ukraine, and our state has done everything for a positive response. The only question is the determination of some European leaders. We will continue to work to facilitate access of Ukrainian goods to all important markets around the world. Customs duties on trade with the European Union have already been abolished. The United States already applies a duty-free regime for Ukrainian steel. Canada has abolished customs duties. The same regime will work in the near future with Britain. We expect trade liberalization from Australia. The Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization has started today. Before it began, representatives of 57 countries gathered for a special event of solidarity with Ukraine, and I am grateful to them - to each and everyone - for that. And as a result of this intergovernmental conference, we will learn, in particular, the timing of the decision on trade liberalization for Ukraine from Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland. So the week will be significant. And I believe that there will be good news for Ukraine. I am grateful to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the American Jewish Committee Global Forum</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-13</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, friends! Mr. David Harris! Every morning I receive several informational reports. Regarding the situation on the frontline, the Russian missile strikes at Ukraine, at our people, and the number of victims of hostilities over the past day. Today, as I record this address, the report on the deceased has changed significantly. The list of killed children became longer by 24 surnames at once, and now it has 287 items. And this is probably one of the worst things that happen during a war. The Russian troops have occupied part of our country, and we do not have complete information about what is happening in the occupied areas. We do not know everything about the murders and other crimes they commit there, in the occupied part of Ukraine. We do not know what they did against our people. We do not know how many bodies the occupiers buried in mass graves or left in the ruins of destroyed cities. But gradually we learn about it. And that&#x27;s how the list of killed children became 24 points longer at once - these are the children who died because of Russian strikes at Mariupol, now we know about them. The boy Maksym is among these 24 children, he was born this year; and the girl Darya, she was also born this year. Maksym and Darya did not live even three months. They died with their parents when they were all buried in the basement of an ordinary apartment building on which a Russian aircraft dropped a bomb. Tell me why is this happening in 2022? This is not the 1940s. How could mass killings, torture, burned cities, filtration camps set up by the Russian military in the occupied territories, which resemble Nazi concentration camps, become a reality? And yet Russia hopes that it will not bear responsibility for all this evil, for all these barbaric strikes at houses, hospitals and churches. Russia still has the power to hope to continue the war against Ukraine, against people and ignore the world&#x27;s reaction. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am aware of your substantive help for our state. But I ask you to redouble your efforts to stop Russian hatred. Hatred for humanity. Yes, it is hatred that is the driving force of this ongoing Russian war against Ukraine and against freedom in Europe, in the world. Hatred for Ukrainian - for the culture of Ukrainians, for the history of Ukraine and for the fact that despite all the horrors of the past, Ukraine has remained a kind and open country for different cultures. Diversity is an important feature of Ukraine. What will be left of this openness, of this peaceful coexistence of different peoples? Russian shells burn even Russian churches in Ukraine. The Russian army destroyed communities in which the Greek community had lived for centuries. Crimean Tatars are the most repressed on the occupied peninsula. Russian missiles hit Babyn Yar in Kyiv, Russian artillery damaged the Menorah in Drobytsky Yar near Kharkiv. Openly anti-Semitic remarks by Russian Foreign Minister have instigated a global scandal. Is this not enough? But it is really not the 1940s now. Therefore, defend the need to enhance sanctions against Russia. You are capable of it. Help us speed up the supply of weapons to Ukraine so that we can liberate the occupied territories. We need powerful weapons for the offensive, without which the war will only drag on and the number of victims will increase. I know that your help is already significant. But you can use even more of your influence. Because we now have a historic opportunity to defend our common freedom, our common security, our common cultural diversity from the greatest wave of hatred that has threatened the world in recent decades. So, let&#x27;s end this war! Let&#x27;s defeat Russian hatred! In the name of children killed by the Russian army. And for the future of millions of children in Ukraine and in various European countries who deserve to live in security and peace. To just live. Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Tell people in the occupied territories about Ukraine, that the Ukrainian army will definitely come - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-13</span></div>
  <p>Strong people of an unbreakable country! Today is the 110th day of our defense. And when you say that - the 110th day - you realize what a great path we have covered. The enemy was driven out of the Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions. A large part of the Kharkiv region was liberated. In total, more than a thousand settlements have been liberated. The invasion of the occupiers in the south of Ukraine was stopped. Yes, they still want to destroy Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, and the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region. They still have enough strength to shoot from the artillery at Zelenodolsk and Hulyaipole. Odesa remains a target for the Russian fleet... But dozens of the attacking attempts of the Russian army have already been thwarted right there in the south. And thanks to the counteroffensive, some communities in the Kherson region have already been liberated. In the battles in Donbas - and they will surely go down in military history as one of the most brutal battles in Europe and for Europe - the Ukrainian army and our intelligence tactically still beat the Russian military. And this is despite the significant advantage of the Russians in the amount of equipment, and especially - artillery systems. The price of this battle for us is very high. It’s just scary. And we draw the attention of our partners on a daily basis to the fact that only a sufficient number of modern artillery for Ukraine will ensure our advantage and finally the end of Russian torture of the Ukrainian Donbas. Today it became known about the death of another child caused by the Russian shelling - right there, right in Donbas, in the Luhansk region. The boy was born in 2016. He lived in Lysychansk, in an ordinary house on Moskovska Street. This is it: a six-year-old boy on Moskovska Street is also, as it turned out, a dangerous enemy for the Russian Federation... We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move on. Free our entire territory. Drive the occupiers out of all our regions. And although now the width of our front is already more than 2.5 thousand kilometers, it is felt that the strategic initiative is still ours. We will come to all our cities, to all our villages, which do not yet have our flag on the administrative buildings. Although there are a lot of Ukrainian flags there, in people’s houses, I&#x27;m sure of it. And we have already seen them when people protested against the occupiers. And we will see them again - everywhere, when we return. We will come to Kherson. And ordinary Kherson residents will meet our army on the streets of the city. The failure of the occupiers, who tried to celebrate the so-called Russia Day, only proves that Kherson is a Ukrainian city. And Kherson residents will celebrate only Ukrainian holidays. We will come to Melitopol. And we will return to all Melitopol residents the opportunity to live without fear. And, by the way, all the collaborators who are now threatening to take away land from farmers in Melitopol and other districts of Zaporizhzhia will most likely end up in this land themselves. We will come to Mariupol. And we will liberate the city for the third time. It was liberated from the Nazis in 1943 by a brilliant operation. In 2014, on this day, June 13, thanks to the courage of our &quot;Azov&quot; and other units, Mariupol was liberated for the second time. Liberated from the militants, who at that time were not yet fully aware of what the Russian state was sending them to. And now they see it all. They see burned Mariupol. They see why the Russians came there. But we will not allow them to make this city dead. We will return it. Definitely. It only takes enough weapons to make it happen. The partners have it. In sufficient quantities. And we work every day for the political will to give us these weapons to appear. We will come to Enerhodar. And I want to repeat to everyone in the city who took to the streets against the Russian military, who refuses to cooperate with the occupiers and who is waiting for us today. I want to repeat that we have not forgotten about our Enerhodar for a day. We must understand that the occupiers are keeping the occupied territory not just in an information blockade. I would call it a civilizational blockade. They are trying to make people not just know nothing about Ukraine and how we are trying to liberate our territory. They are trying to make them stop even thinking about returning to normal life, forcing them to reconcile. In some areas, the occupiers are deliberately preventing the restoration of electricity supply. In many communities, they simply blocked communication. Our television is being turned off. They closed the exit from the occupation and simply do not even allow humanitarian corridors so that we can bring people at least basic goods and medicines. And I ask everyone who has such an opportunity to communicate with people in the occupied south, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv region. Tell them about Ukraine. Tell them the truth. Say that there will be liberation. Say it to Kyrylivka, Henichesk, Berdyansk, Manhush. Say it to Horlivka, Donetsk, Luhansk. Say it to everyone in the Kharkiv region who is still forced to see the Russian flag on our Ukrainian land. Tell them that the Ukrainian army will definitely come. Of course, we will liberate our Crimea as well. The flag of Ukraine will fly again over Yalta and Sudak, over Dzhankoi and Yevpatoriya. And let every Russian official who has seized precious land in Crimea remember: this is not the land where they will have peace. There is no one today who will say exactly how long our path to victory will take. But the vast majority of people today are already aware - this is our path. This is how this war will end. We will rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. From Volnovakha to Chortkiv. Because this is Ukraine. And it is our destiny to return and strengthen it. I am proud of all our defenders! Eternal glory to you! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by the occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Even though Russia has fewer and fewer modern missiles, Ukraine&#x27;s need for anti-missile systems remains - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-14</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, our air defense units managed to &quot;cut the wings&quot; of Russian missiles. Some of the missiles fired by the occupiers at our cities were shot down. And these are saved lives. This is a saved infrastructure. But we managed to shoot down only part of them. Unfortunately, there are victims, there is destruction. Today, the Lviv and Ternopil regions were hit. And we keep telling our partners that Ukraine needs modern anti-missile weapons. Our country does not have it at a sufficient level yet, but it is our country in Europe that needs such weapons most right now. Delay with its provision cannot be justified. I will constantly emphasize this when talking to our partners. We made the first requests for anti-missile systems long before the full-scale invasion. And this week there will be many different important talks - and not only with European politicians who are able to provide Ukraine with modern anti-missile systems. Even though Russia has fewer and fewer modern missiles with each passing day, Ukraine&#x27;s need for such systems remains. Because Russia still has enough Soviet types of missiles, which are even more dangerous. They are many times less precise, and therefore threaten civilian objects and ordinary residential buildings much more. I spoke today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. Of course, the number one topic was defense support. Canada is among the leaders in it. I expressed gratitude for the fact that Canada became the first country to transfer special assistance to the Ukrainian account at the IMF - about $ 800 million. I also had a conversation with the President of Ecuador. I congratulated him on the election of Ecuador as a member of the UN Security Council. I informed him about the current situation on the battlefield and called for increasing pressure on Russia to end this war. Both this conversation with the President of Ecuador and yesterday&#x27;s conversation with the President of Guatemala are just the beginning of our new policy of restoring relations with Latin America. Today I asked the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to be very attentive to reports in the media and on social networks that some of our fighters do not have enough personal protective equipment. The reports I receive are significantly different from what is discussed by society. And I expect inspections of logistics in the army - inspections of what is supplied and how personal protective equipment is distributed. Today, everyone in the areas of hostilities must have everything they need to protect themselves. The state provides such supplies. Over the past day no drastic changes have taken place in the battle in Donbas. The fiercest fighting is in Severodonetsk and in all cities and communities nearby - as before. The losses, unfortunately, are painful. But we have to hold on. This is our state. It is vital to hold on there, in Donbas. The more losses the enemy suffers there, the less power they will have to continue the aggression. Therefore, the Donbas direction is key to determining who will dominate in the coming weeks. We also have painful losses in the Kharkiv region, where the Russian army is trying to strengthen its position. The battles for this direction continue, and we still have to fight hard for complete security for Kharkiv and the region. We continue to put pressure on the occupiers in the south. The key goal is the liberation of Kherson, and we will move towards this step by step. I signed another decree on awarding those who excelled in battles. 63 servicemen were awarded for bravery and efficiency in defending the state. The total number of awarded is already 18,453. And such a scale, such a number of feats fully demonstrate the level of confrontation and the brutality of hostilities. I thank everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by the occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine to both houses of the Parliament of the Czech Republic</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-15</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President of the Senate! Dear Madam President of the Chamber of Deputies! Dear Prime Minister, members of the government! Dear members of the parliament, attendees, journalists! Dear Czech people! First of all, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to address both houses of the Parliament of the Czech Republic and absolutely all Czechs in this format today. I would like to thank you for those warm words, strong words of support for our people, me personally, our state, which were heard here today, and for the warmth with which you shelter our forcibly displaced persons. We appreciate it, it&#x27;s truly historical. I am grateful to you for this personally and on behalf of every Ukrainian. I was thinking how to begin my speech. I will begin with words that each of you knows for sure and that all Europeans who respect history and freedom on our continent know for sure: Jsme s vámi, buďte s námi! These are words of extraordinary importance. They had such importance when they sounded on Czech radio in 1968, supporting the resistance. They are extremely important now as well, when - recalling them - we are talking about those who fought for freedom for your people. But, in fact, these words have one more dimension. Now, when the Ukrainian people are fighting for freedom against the brutal Russian invasion, we can say that it is with these words that we, Ukrainians, address all the peoples of Europe, all the peoples of the democratic world. We are with you, be with us! We oppose tyranny, which - as in the past - does not want to stop only in Ukraine. It considers everyone in Europe its target, all those who live a free life. Russia is not interested only in our cities of Mariupol, Severodonetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and Kyiv. No. Its ambitions are focused on the vast space from Warsaw to Sofia, from Prague to Tallinn. And as in the past, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is only the first step that the Russian leadership needs to open the way to other countries, to the conquest of other nations. This is openly said not only by Russian state propagandists, but also by Russian officials. They have already reached the point, for example, of threatening to officially revoke the recognition of the Baltic states&#x27; independence. And then what’s next? Who is next? Ladies and Gentlemen! When Ukraine appeals to European countries for support, we are guided by this principle, by these words that have become one of the foundations of your history: we are with you, be with us. Russian tanks storming the cities of the Ukrainian Donbas, trying to attack the Ukrainian Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, must be stopped and burned or expelled from the territory of independent Ukraine. So that they can never again come to Prague, or to Ostrava, or to Brno, or to Pilsen, or to Karlovy Vary, or to any other city on our continent. It is in Ukraine that the battle for the future of Europe is taking place right now. I am very grateful to your state, to your people for the generous help in this struggle. The Czech Republic helped us both with weapons - very substantively and immediately after it became necessary - and politically. I thank the leadership of the state for that. You can be sure that you have supported yourself and your own freedom, your own life with that. And support must be maintained for as long as it takes to win. This is how this confrontation must end - with victory. And even if some politicians in some countries are afraid of the possibility that freedom will win and tyranny will lose, there are no your leaders among such politicians. The Czech people are well aware of how compromises at the expense of others end and what concessions to tyranny lead to, which proposes to take away only the supposedly part of the desired territory to pretend that the aggression has stopped. He who wants to capture everything will never stop, taking only part. I urge you to continue together with us, without stopping for a moment, to convince all those who have not yet managed to choose a clear side in this confrontation, which has been going on for 112 days already, of this simple truth. Ukraine must get everything to win. Modern and powerful enough weapons - the Prime Minister talked about that today - to get advantage over the Russian army. Financial support - to have resources against Russia, whose savings and revenues are still very significant - in 100 days of this war since February 24 Russia has already earned 93 billion euros on the sale of energy only. Ukraine must also receive fundamental support of values that will finally deprive Russia of its main ideological weapon, namely the assertion that Europe is incapable of real unification and that it does not need Ukraine. In the near future, we must receive an answer from the European Union - from all member states - to the question of Ukraine&#x27;s status. Providing Ukraine with the candidacy right now is proving that European unification is real and that European values really work and are not just defined in certain documents as a beautiful formality. The Russian troops are well aware that they are fighting against European values, against the fact that any free people of Europe who share common European values can become part of the European Union. This is the ideological firmware of the Russian occupiers. So strengthening Europe&#x27;s union and saying “yes” to Ukraine is also a defense in this war. This will be another historical manifestation of the meaning contained in the words: we are with you, be with us. That is why I ask you to be as active as possible these days, these weeks, so that all European leaders agree that defending and strengthening Europe is our common cause, and so that no one can make an exception to this principle. The fateful Czech “eights” - 1938, 1948, 1968 - are comprehensive answers to all those who still want to &quot;pacify&quot; the aggressor by betraying European values and weakening Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Czech people! The Czech presidency of the European Union will begin in a few weeks. And at this time there will be no less challenges before us, before the whole of Europe, than now. But they are transforming. I very much appreciate the key attention paid to Ukraine in the priorities of the Czech presidency. We have to agree on the seventh package of sanctions against Russia for this aggression, for this war. And we also have to substantively move on to the reconstruction of Ukraine - of the entire liberated territory. When you, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Petr, visited our capital in March, you became one of the first European leaders to boldly show that Europe is and will be with Ukraine. And I believe that the Czech Republic will be among the leaders in the implementation of the largest economic and infrastructural project of our time - the Ukrainian reconstruction. This is a special opportunity to show all the strength of Europe - technological, institutional, creative. We must ensure full synchronization of the Ukrainian National Reconstruction Plan and the European Reconstruction Platform in order to implement them as efficiently and quickly as possible. I also invite you to join the reconstruction of Ukraine at the national level - taking patronage over one of the regions or cities, or communities, towns of Ukraine, which suffered from Russian aggression. Such a reconstruction will be the best proof that no aggression, no matter how brutal, will ever achieve its goals and be ever able to break any of the European nations, let alone Europe as a whole. I am grateful to you for the sincere and full support of our people, our Ukrainian temporarily displaced persons. You have sheltered hundreds of our people fleeing the war on your land. Thousands of people live in your homes, receive help from your families. We must do everything so that each and every one of them can return home, return to Ukraine. We can come - and we will come - to the fact that the principle of following the rule: &quot;Jsme s vámi, buďte s námi!&quot; - will have a result that can be described in other important words - in the words of Václav Havel: &quot;Truth and love have to overcome lies and hatred.&quot; Unfortunately, this has often failed in the history of Europe. But now, in 2022, in Ukraine and, most importantly, together - we can ensure this so powerfully that the fruits of our victory will be enjoyed by many generations of our nations. Děkuji vám! Ať žije Česko! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every day we are fighting for Ukraine to receive the necessary weapons and equipment, but the courage, wisdom and tactical skills of our heroes cannot be imported - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-15</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you! The long and very busy day is over. Foreign policy has been a priority since the morning. In two vital areas at once - defense and Europe. I have just finished my conversation with Boris Johnson. Key topics were defense support and coordination of steps on the eve of important meetings in June. Today there is a lot of news about the third meeting in the &quot;Rammstein&quot; format. This is a format for the work of defense ministers of partner countries that determine the support packages for our country. And the news is really good. We expect an increase in this support. By the way, we have another signal that defense support for Ukraine will be continued. As part of Rammstein, Britain and Denmark announced a special donors&#x27; conference in Copenhagen in August. 14 states are preliminary involved. I had an important conversation with US President Biden today. The United States has announced a new strengthening of our defense, a new $ 1 billion support package including coastal defense, artillery, modern rocket systems. We will be looking forward to it. I am grateful for this support, it is especially important for our defense in Donbas. I am also grateful for the leadership in mobilizing the help of all partners. There is also a new package of humanitarian support for Ukraine - a quarter of a billion US dollars. We also discussed with President Biden the tactical situation on the battlefield and ways to accelerate our victory. Sanctions, politics, economic cooperation - we are preparing for new steps. I was invited to speak at the NATO Summit in Madrid, as well as at the G7 meeting. In the afternoon there was a special summit with the leaders of the Western Balkans - the Prime Ministers of Montenegro and Albania came to Kyiv, and the Prime Minister of North Macedonia was present in a video format. Ukraine has received a significant decision by these countries to support the status of a candidate for EU membership for us - three countries have adopted such a joint statement. In fact, today we are as close to this status as we couldn’t have dreamed of even a few years ago. Ukraine has done everything possible to obtain a candidacy. And today, in my address to the Parliament of the Czech Republic, I emphasized that the response to our candidacy will be the response of the European Union not only to Ukraine, but also to themselves - their future, the future of the European Union. Of course, the Russian state would not be itself if it simply watched our foreign policy success. Gas pressure on Europe is growing again. The shelling of Ukrainian positions and peaceful cities is intensifying again. Today they hit Mykolaiv, communities of the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Kharkiv region. Russian propagandists have become more active in producing fakes to provoke despair in Ukraine. But I do not believe that at least some of these fakes can work. We are defending Donbas. And, by the way, in all international contacts I hear admiration for the actions of our defenders. The world really wants to learn from Ukrainians how to fight and how to win. During the 112 days of this war, the Ukrainian army proved that courage and wisdom on the battlefield, together with the ability to tactically defeat the enemy, give significant results, even despite the significant advantage of the Russian army in the number of soldiers and equipment. Of course, we will do our best to outmatch their advantages for now. Every day I fight for Ukraine to get the necessary weapons and equipment. But courage, wisdom and tactical skills cannot be imported. Our heroes have it. I signed regular decrees awarding Ukrainian warriors. 284 servicemen were awarded state awards, 60 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who defends the state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It was important to hear from the EU leaders that the end of the war and peace for Ukraine must be exactly as our people see them - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-16</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today is a truly historic day - Ukraine has felt the support of four powerful European states at once. And in particular support for our movement to the European Union. Italy, Romania, France and Germany are with us. All four leaders - Mr. Draghi, Mr. Iohannis, Mr. Macron and Mr. Scholz - support Ukraine&#x27;s candidacy. Of course, all relevant procedures must be followed, and all EU member states must join. But at our meeting today a big step was made - a step forward. It was important for me to hear from the leaders another fundamental thing - they agree that the end of the war and peace for Ukraine must be exactly as Ukraine sees them. As our people see them. I am grateful to Italy for its principled political support, macro-financial and defense assistance. Historically we now have the best relations - and I am sure we can do a lot more for our nations. I am grateful to Romania for the defense assistance and assistance in the transit of our goods, including grain. We agreed to increase export capacity through the territory of Romania. France will provide additional Caesar artillery systems. This is very important for our defense. Also today, President Macron openly said that the European support for Ukraine should really demonstrate that we defend the same values, defend Europe together. Germany has confirmed the provision of air defense systems for our country and further support. By the way, when four leaders arrived in Kyiv today, it coincided with the beginning of the air raid siren. Russia has created a background for everyone to hear these sirens to create a tense atmosphere. But no one was scared, and it only inspired us to be as specific as possible and to negotiate for our interests - for all Ukrainians and for all in Europe. Today I personally thanked Chancellor Scholz for inviting me to the G7 meeting. In general, my impression of the meeting is positive. All leaders understand why negotiations to end the war are not under way. Exclusively because of Russia&#x27;s position, which is only trying to intimidate everyone in Europe and continue the destruction of our state. They do not want to look for a way to peace. This is an aggressor who must decide for himself that the war must end. We will continue to fight until we guarantee our state full security and territorial integrity. We talked today about the preparation of a new sanctions package against Russia. We talked about overcoming the food crisis provoked by Russia. The resumption of exports of Ukrainian agricultural products is vital for dozens of countries. And there is only one reason why the food crisis has become possible at all: Russia is to blame, and no one else. All leaders already recognize this. We talked about the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war - we have very specific views of partners on this. I believe that it is not a coincidence that the situation with gas in Europe has worsened today - the price has jumped again. Russia has done this on purpose, restricting supplies to harm Europe, to strike at Europeans. Gazprom is simply pulling on the gas chain in which they have been trying to shackle Europe for a long time. And this is another argument in favor of the fact that Europe must now switch to life without Russian gas. There should be no such dependence. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow there will also be a lot of news for Ukraine, and I believe that they will be positive. I really believe that. I would like to emphasize once again that all this is possible first of all thanks to our heroes, thanks to each and everyone who protects us from Russian troops. Today, the Ukrainian army is fighting in the conditions of a significant quantitative advantage of the enemy - in technology, in artillery systems. Fighting in such conditions is a daily feat. We do everything to give our heroes modern and powerful weapons. And I am proud of all those who have been repelling the occupier and all the attacks for 113 days of the full-scale war already. It is thanks to the bravery of Ukrainian men and women that Europe can create this new history of freedom and finally remove the &quot;gray&quot; zone between the EU and Russia in Eastern Europe. Ukraine has come closest to the European Union since independence. Eternal glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine! Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by these occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Both Ukraine and the Western Balkans are equally interested in a united Europe - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address to the participants of the Prespa Forum Dialogue</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President Pendarovski, Dear Presidents, Prime Ministers, Parliamentarians! Dear attendees! Friends! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and leave my arguments for discussion at your important Forum. Now is a historic moment for Europe and European security, when everyone has to decide: what Europe is and what Europe will be like in the future. Will it be as free as it is now? Will it be as safe as most Europeans are used to? Will it be as socially and economically developed, inspiring societies outside Europe to change their way of life? Russia has challenged us all - every nation on the continent, every region of Europe. For Ukraine, this is the most dreadful military challenge, and we have been defending ourselves for 113 days already against Russia&#x27;s ambition to destroy the Ukrainian people and our culture. Ukrainian cities destroyed by the Russian army; millions of migrants; hundreds of thousands of people deported by the Russian military; and tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed are all blatant manifestations of Russia&#x27;s anti-European policy. By starting this war against Ukraine, Russia tried to create a springboard for an attack on other nations of Europe. That is why our defense in this war and our future victory are fundamentally important for the security of everyone in Europe. But in addition to this blatant manifestation of Russia&#x27;s anti-European policy, there are many other manifestations of it. Smaller, but still very vile and destructive, openly aggressive. And I would like to draw your attention to the fact that today there is not a single country left in Europe that has not suffered from at least one of the many manifestations of Russia&#x27;s anti-European policy. Ladies and Gentlemen! All of us in a democratic world have faced an unprecedented energy crisis. For many years, Russia has been creating the impression that it is allegedly a reliable supplier of energy resources. But in reality it managed to make different European countries dependent on it. And now, when Russia decided to wage a war to conquer European nations, it used this energy chain first. It specially provoked historically extremely high gas prices. It specially restricts gas supplies, blackmailing individual countries and Europe as a whole. It violates existing contracts – requires payment for gas in rubles and artificially limits the volume of supply. This pressure on the gas market, as well as the use of other instruments by Russia, has led to a significant acceleration of inflation. This simply would not be the case if Russia acted as a responsible supplier and did not want to create a crisis. An even worse scenario is being implemented in the food market. It provokes not only rising prices for basic foodstuffs, but also a new migrant crisis. Russia&#x27;s blockade of Ukrainian ports and strikes at our agro-industrial infrastructure cause deficits in important regional segments of the world food market. Ukrainian wheat, corn, sunflower oil and other commodities have been indispensable for global food stability. Russia knew where to hit to create this crisis. And it deliberately increases it prolonging the war against our state and refusing to make the Black Sea safe for navigation. Why is it doing this? So that a new migrant wave hits, in particular, your countries, as well as your neighbors in Europe. How many millions of refugees will there be in Europe if Russian policy causes famine in African and Asian countries? And if the shortage of products there and the price crisis provoke political chaos and the fall of governments? Will you then be able to pursue a consolidated policy? That&#x27;s why Russia wants a food crisis. And I will mention another element of Russia&#x27;s anti-European policy. Russia is perhaps the world&#x27;s largest investor in propaganda - and not just for domestic audience. Russia spends billions of dollars a year to deceive foreign audience and to incite hostility. And the connection between propaganda and war is obvious: in the first months of this year, Russia&#x27;s propaganda budget was tripled. I am sure that each and every one of you knows what propaganda tools have worked or are still working against your states. And this instrument of Russia has only one task: to make it worse. In particular, worse for you. Ladies and Gentlemen! That is why any serious discussion of the security architecture in Europe must be based on the need to free Europe from the chains of dependence that the Russian state has been creating for decades. Security is simply impossible without it, and it is the same for the north of Europe, for the south, for the west and for the east. That is why such sanctions are needed for anti-European policy of Russia, so that they will forever remember the price, including for the food crisis. The one who creates artificial famine must become a global outcast and suffer painful losses. This should be taken into account in the preparation of the seventh EU sanctions package. And we need to realize that sanctions packages have, in fact, become part of the continent&#x27;s security architecture. They work for stability and peace - limiting Russia&#x27;s ability to expand aggression. Europe&#x27;s full energy independence is needed. Any ties with Russia that it uses to make money on Europe and pursue anti-European policy must be severed. There can be no trade with Russia - you should not give money to those who seek your destruction. And most importantly - we need to make the whole of Europe finally united. This is what Ukraine and your countries - the Western Balkans - are equally interested in. Full-fledged European integration of Ukraine, as well as full-fledged European integration of your states, is a historical strengthening of Europe and a complete dismantling of Russia&#x27;s ability to beat us one by one. The EU-Western Balkans High Level Summit will take place shortly. I sincerely wish it will be successful for your states. And I am grateful to you for the support of Ukraine that you provide at various levels, so that this June will be successful for our country in relations with the EU. By answering us about our European perspective and by answering you about your European perspective, the nations of Europe and European politicians are answering questions about the future of Europe. These are the questions I voiced at the beginning of my address. What will Europe be like in the future? Will it be as free as it is now? Will it be as safe as most Europeans are used to? Will it be as socially and economically developed, inspiring societies outside Europe to change their way of life? We need a positive answer – to our and your European perspective. And I am grateful to you for working together on such an answer. I wish us all success! I wish us all victory! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We managed to liberate Ukrainian paramedic Yulia “Tayra” Payevska from captivity – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-17</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! We are now one step from the beginning of full-fledged integration with the European Union. We have a positive conclusion from the European Commission on the candidacy for Ukraine. And this is a historical achievement of all those who work for our state. The only thing left is to wait for the decision of the European Council next week. And I believe that Ukraine has done everything possible for this step to be positive as well – the decision of the European Council, i.e. the leaders of the EU states. Ukraine deserves this positive. Ukrainian values are European values. Ukrainian institutions maintain resilience even in conditions of war. Ukrainian democratic habits have not lost their power even now. And our rapprochement with the European Union is not only positive for us. This is the greatest contribution to the future of Europe in many years. Let me remind you now only one thing: after February 24, our country acceded to the European energy system. Our networks - Ukraine and the European Union - work in sync despite a full-scale war. Hence, even this fact alone shows everything at once - the professionalism of our people, the strength of our institutions, our ability to fulfill promises and the magnitude of Ukraine&#x27;s potential. And I want to emphasize that Ukraine&#x27;s European integration is not something purely political, not something detached from the lives of ordinary people. On the contrary. The closer we are to other European countries, the more opportunities we will have to guarantee all Ukrainians a modern and prosperous life. I spoke today with Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. I thanked her and all members of the European Commission for their leadership and today’s decision. I also spoke with European Council President Charles Michel. We are coordinating our steps. And I am grateful to Charles for feeling the historical significance of these processes for both Ukraine and the future of Europe. Today I will also speak with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte. I use every opportunity for our interests, for Ukraine. During yesterday&#x27;s visit to Kyiv by the leaders of France, Germany, Romania and Italy, it was clear what far-reaching prospects are being opened both for our country and for all Europeans if we continue to work together. And today this understanding has become even clearer. European strength, European independence and European development can be imagined truly powerful only with Ukraine. It is interesting, by the way, how the course of history chooses the time for important decisions: the government of Ukraine abolished the agreement on visa-free regime with the Russian Federation today. Now the visa regime will be effective starting from July 1. It is difficult to overestimate the symbolism of what happened today. But no one picked the moment on purpose. This is what the course of history is. Russia itself has done everything to destroy any ties with Ukraine. Well, we are doing everything to make our ties with Europe as strong as possible. Boris Johnson visited Kyiv today. This is already the second visit of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to our capital since February 24. The negotiations are positive. We discussed the situation on the frontline and ways to achieve our victory. I am grateful to Boris for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, including with weapons. I am also grateful that we equally perceive the need for unconditional protection of our state. We talked about security guarantees for Ukraine. When we define the parameters of these guarantees, they will determine the future of Ukrainians and all Europeans for generations to come. In general, the week was maximally useful for Ukraine – in many areas. And I would also like to thank US President Biden today for increasing American support for Ukraine every week. And this week we have significant results on the front exactly due to the support of the United States. I have just signed new decrees on awarding our heroes. 413 combatants were awarded state awards, 29 of them posthumously. And finally. Today I can already announce this: we managed to liberate “Tayra”, Ukrainian paramedic Yulia Payevska, from captivity. I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result. &quot;Tayra&quot; is already home. We will keep working to liberate everyone. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our independence and our freedom! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will not give away the south to anyone, we will return everything that’s ours and the sea will be Ukrainian - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-19</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you! Nightly, almost morning report. I am coming back from the south - visited today our frontline positions in the Mykolaiv region, visited Mykolaiv itself, and the Odesa region as well. I talked to our defenders - military, police, National Guard, territorial defense. Their mood is confident, and looking into their eyes it is obvious that they all do not doubt our victory. Thanked them for the service, for the protection of our state. Thanked the parents of such brave children. Really very strong. Presented awards to the best. Presented the Order of the Golden Star to the Hero of Ukraine Colonel Vadym Sukharevsky, commander of the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade. We will not give away the south to anyone, we will return everything that&#x27;s ours and the sea will be Ukrainian and safe. Both in Mykolaiv, and in Odesa I held meetings with our military, with all officials who are responsible for defense and maintenance of these two regions. Listened to the reports on the destruction of the regions caused by Russian strikes. The losses are significant. Many houses were destroyed, civilian logistics were disrupted, there are many social issues. I have commissioned to make assistance to people who have lost loved ones more systemic. We will definitely restore everything that was destroyed. Russia does not have as many missiles as our people have the desire to live. Substantively discussed the economic situation, the work of the agricultural sector. Discussed the security of our ports and opportunities for the export of our agricultural products. Our position is clear and unchanged - as soon as we can ensure security through international mediation, Ukraine will do everything possible to counter the food crisis that broke out across the world – in Asia, Africa and most countries of the world – due to the Russian war. I visited city hospitals in Mykolaiv and Odesa. I thanked the doctors and nurses - they are our heroes. On the eve of the Medical Workers’ Day, I congratulated them on their professional holiday. I had a conversation with our defenders wounded in battles. Yesterday I signed a decree conferring the rank of Major General upon the Commander of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Tetyana Ostashchenko. Today I had the honor to personally congratulate Tetyana Mykolaivna on this rank. And I always say in my appeals on purpose – male and female defenders. I want all of us in Ukraine to always emphasize the contribution of both men and women to the defense of our state. My main impressions today are absolute pride in our people. I am proud of all those who defend the state! I am grateful to everyone who saves people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Tomorrow a historic week begins, when we will hear the answer from the EU on the candidate status for Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-19</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! There were many congratulations in our country today. June 19 is Medical Workers’ Day, Father&#x27;s Day and Farmer&#x27;s Day. Of course, today I would like to thank all our doctors, all Ukrainian nurses, who have been literally on the frontline since February 24. Thank you for the tens of thousands of second birthdays you gave to our military, our civilians, our Ukrainian children. Thank you for saving lives on the front, in hospitals across our country. Ukrainian doctors are countless examples of extraordinary heroism. Heroism of those who carried out surgeries under shelling. Who worked in the blockade in Mariupol. Who survived the occupation, captivity and even in such conditions, as much as possible, saved lives - the most precious thing. I would also like to thank our farmers today. Those who defended their communities even with bare hands when stopping the Russian military. Who, despite the war, ensured a sowing campaign. Those who were even nicknamed &quot;tractor troops&quot; when they were taking Russian trophy equipment from the battlefield. And now that Russia has blocked our exports through the Black Sea ports, the whole world has seen who Ukrainian farmers really are and what the work of our agricultural sector is worth. Of course, I would like to thank all the fathers in Ukraine. All those who raised their children as good, decent, brave people. People who defend the state and do everything to help their neighbors live through the war. The Ukrainian courage that inspires the world so much, the Ukrainian freedom that strengthens the whole of Europe are possible only because Ukrainian parents have raised such children. Children with an understanding of values, able to be true heroes. Tomorrow a truly historic week begins. A week when we will hear the answer from the European Union on the candidate status for Ukraine. We already have a positive decision from the European Commission, and at the end of the new week there will be a response from the European Council. I think it is obvious to everyone that since 1991 there have been few such fateful decisions for Ukraine as we expect now. And I am convinced that only a positive decision meets the interests of the whole of Europe. I will deliver new addresses this week, including to Europeans. I will take every opportunity to defend the European perspective for Ukraine, for each of us, and to gather new supporters for us. Obviously, we should expect greater hostile activity from Russia. Purposefully - demonstratively. This week exactly. And not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries. We are preparing. We are ready. We warn partners. The occupiers are accumulating forces in the Kharkiv direction, in the Zaporizhzhia region. They struck at our fuel infrastructure again - they want to worsen the fuel situation. Of course, we will respond to this, too. Fierce fighting continues in Donbas. The Russian army uses the greatest number of artillery there, the greatest number of offensive forces. But Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka and other hot spots are holding on. Our people are like that. They are holding on. Our army is holding on. And I am grateful to everyone whose strength today means our victory tomorrow. Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Fights hard! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The Three Seas Initiative needs the potential of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the Three Seas Initiative Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-20</span></div>
  <p>Thank you so much, Mr. President! Thank you for all the kind words in support of Ukraine! For what has just been said, for what you and our friends have done for the strength of our state! Dear colleagues, friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am also grateful for the invitation, Mr. President Levits! I am grateful to you and I have the honor to address all present today. I will begin my address immediately with the key thing, given our precious time. I&#x27;ll start with what we offer. First, Ukraine must be a participant in the Three Seas Initiative. It is wrong that our state remained outside the Initiative. We need to find a format in which we can implement the accession. Just one look at the geographical map of our region is enough to understand that it is only with Ukraine that all our countries can realize their full potential. Economic, infrastructural, potential of social ties between our countries, between our people and the historical basis of life in our region. Based on this, my second suggestion is to strengthen the interpretation of cooperation in the framework of the Three Seas Initiative. Every sphere we can work on together in this Initiative is really about security. And first of all it is logistics. Please look at the Ukrainian situation now: it is the states of the Three Seas that are our connection to the free world. The supply of weapons to Ukraine, the supply of fuel, the preservation of vital transport flows, green corridors for the export of Ukrainian food, the migration of people - all this works through the territory of the member states of this Initiative. In the same way, the Three Seas Initiative is destined to become an effective rear for any country in our region, if it is also - God forbid, of course - threatened by Russia. When the enemy comes, everything matters: roads, railways, ports, the energy system, speed at the borders, even the habit of working together. That is why it is our duty to deepen all connections in this space. It is these connections that are our security, after all. The third proposal is energy. Ukraine has one of the most powerful gas storage facilities in the region and an extensive gas supply network. Therefore, by cooperating with our neighbors, using the capacities of the Poland-Slovakia, Poland-Ukraine interconnectors, as well as the LNG terminals available in the region, we can meet the needs of all the countries of the Three Seas Initiative. Already after the start of a full-scale Russian invasion, we joined the European Union&#x27;s energy system. And now our electricity exports can be a contribution to the energy balance of your countries, which will help you become completely independent of Russian energy pressure. The fourth suggestion is that we must do everything we can to make the Trans-European Corridor Via Carpathia work one hundred percent, connecting northern and southern Europe. Ukraine can play the role of one of the logistics centers. And we are ready to join Via Carpathia right now. We are ready to integrate into the European railway network, in particular through the Warsaw-Kyiv railway line and access to the Rail Baltica railway corridor. We must continue to work on expanding checkpoints on the borders of our state. Fifth proposal - Ukraine can support many infrastructure projects in the field of digitization and strengthen our regional digital ties. Keep in mind that the Ukrainian experience in combating cyber threats is truly unique and can be very useful for each of your countries. And the sixth proposal - participation in the project of reconstruction of Ukraine. This will be the largest economic project of our generation. Politicians often say that economic prosperity is the foundation of national security. And it really is. But not as often as they say, politicians manage to implement this principle. That is to make the economy so powerful that the state itself becomes powerful enough. Now we have such a historic chance. But only if we work together will we be able to use it. The Three Seas Initiative needs the potential of Ukraine. We are ready. We are willing. For the first time, Ukraine has been invited to participate in the Three Seas Initiative Summit today. I am grateful. However, you know - while this war is going on, I can&#x27;t leave the state. So I can&#x27;t be with you right now. But I am sure that you can now involve us in specific infrastructure projects, and will find a status that will allow us to participate in the activities of your Initiative. I believe it is possible! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In order to eliminate the threat of famine, Russia&#x27;s efforts to return to the aggressive policy of colonialism must end – speech by the President of Ukraine at the session of the Bureau of the Assembly of the African Union</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-20</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. Chairperson of the African Union, Dear Mr. Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Distinguished heads of state and government, Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for this opportunity to address you. Address you in a state of emergency, when we have a war. In an emergency for the whole world, when Africa is actually taken hostage. Hostage of those who started the war against our state. Yes, this is war. Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine. Not a crisis, not a conflict, as it is still defined sometimes. No, this is a war! A brutal war, a war of invasion. Russian troops have come to our land and want to conquer our people. This war may seem very distant to you and your countries. But catastrophically rising food prices have already brought it home to millions of African families. As well as to many families in Asia, Europe, Latin America. The unjust and provoked by the Russian war level of food prices is painfully felt on all continents. Unfortunately, this can become a particular problem for your countries. We need to take into account various factors - population growth on the African continent, the ongoing economic recovery after the pandemic, the lack of domestic financial resources in many countries to buy food at much higher prices. Given the physical shortage in the global market, some countries on the African continent find it particularly difficult to maintain the necessary food supplies. But why and when did this problem arise? I emphasize that such a problem did not exist on February 23 this year. It is true that unusual inflationary processes have already taken place in different parts of the world. Various countries have already sent huge sums of money to support the economy in the crisis through COVID-19. However, there was nothing like a food shortage. The crisis began on February 24, when the Russian fleet blocked Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The sea route is the main one for the agrarian sector of our state. And Ukrainian agricultural exports are one of the foundations of the stability of the global food market. Ukraine is one of the main suppliers of wheat, sunflower oil and corn. According to expert estimates, the lives of about four hundred million people in different countries of the world depend on the export of our food. And if it was not for the Russian war against Ukraine, there simply would be no shortage in the food market. If it was not for the Russian war, our farmers and agricultural companies could have ensured record harvests this year. If it was not for the Russian war, people in Africa, people in Asia and anywhere else in the world would not suffer from the catastrophic rise in food prices. There simply would not be such a catastrophic rise in prices. Ladies and Gentlemen! This situation shows how connected everything is in the world. One war in Europe, namely Russia&#x27;s attempt to seize our land, to turn Ukraine into a Russian colony, has led to a deterioration in access to food and a growing threat of famine everywhere. Of course, we are defending ourselves, of course, we will defend our independence until we win this war. And, of course, we are already trying to build new supply logistics. Right now we have more than 25 million tons of grain in the elevators awaited by traditional consumers of Ukrainian products. We are establishing exports by rail and through the ports of neighboring countries, so that last year&#x27;s harvest and this year&#x27;s harvest could reach consumers. But much smaller volume can be supplied via new routes, and it takes much more time. This results in a much more expensive supply. We are holding complex multilevel negotiations to unblock our Ukrainian ports. But you see that there is no progress yet. Because no real tool has yet been found to ensure that Russia does not attack them again. That is why the food crisis in the world will continue as long as this colonizing war continues, Russia&#x27;s war against our state, and as long as our ports are blocked. Ukraine was also one of the main European producers of fertilizers. And now production is virtually stopped - again because of the war. Some manufacturers do not have the raw materials and even the ability to work - due to the threat of Russian missile strikes and other consequences of hostilities. Some companies are already in combat zones and were simply destroyed by Russian troops. Have you heard about this from your Russian partners with whom you maintain contact? Did they tell you that? I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re telling you completely different things. But, in fact, they need this crisis. They are deliberately exacerbating it. Because they are trying to use you and the suffering of the people to put pressure on the democracies that have imposed sanctions on Russia. I emphasize that the sanctions policy is aimed only to stop Russia from trying to turn Ukraine into its slave. Ladies and Gentlemen! We all see that the existing architecture of global security and international organizations are not yet able to influence the aggressor state to end this war and restore international security. Did the UN Security Council work? No. Moreover, your voice in the UN Security Council - the voice of Africa - has not been fully heard. But in today&#x27;s globalized world, a world without Africa and Africa without ties with the world are impossible. And it is right that the African Union conducts a principled activity, defending the interests of all the inhabitants of your continent. However, your voice should be strong enough in all international structures. And if they need to be reformed for that, including the UN Security Council, then we need to do so. That is why, for example, on April 5, in my address to the UN Security Council, I proposed to convene in Kyiv - of course, after this war and our victory - a global conference on UN reform and transformation. I also launched a new policy of Ukraine towards Africa. It was during my term that the first Strategy for the Development of Ukraine&#x27;s Relations with African States was approved. Dialogue with all countries of the continent will be intensified. The Special Representative of Ukraine for African Affairs will also start working in the near future. I want us to fully understand one another and interact without intermediaries - for our common interests. And the fact that there are such interests is quite obvious after February 24. Because the stability of your countries depends on the stability in Ukraine and in our region. Pursuant to my instruction, the first regional tour of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to the states of Sub-Saharan Africa is being prepared. Of course, we also need to develop inter-parliamentary dialogue. To this end, I am initiating visits to African countries by representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. I invite you to visit our country now to renew our bilateral ties. And I propose to start preparing, with our common willingness, a large political and economic conference &quot;Ukraine - Africa&quot;. In many countries of the African Union, Ukraine is well known economically and in the educational sphere. In fact, our relationship is very old. Our specialists have been building enterprises in your countries in Soviet times. Your students have studied at our universities and are studying now. We have always contributed to the maintenance of peace on the African continent. Until February 24, more than 300 Ukrainian blue helmets performed tasks within six UN missions. And our national contingent, including the 18th Separate Helicopter Detachment, was an important part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And it is on this basis of the relationship that has existed for many, many years that we must build a new political history. We can do it. We must free our people from the threats artificially created for us by any states that simply want to conquer us, use our resources and our land. And our number one task now is to finally get rid of the threat of famine. In the XXI century, such a threat simply cannot exist - thanks to Ukraine, thanks to our agricultural sector. We cover any deficits, we produce everything so that there is enough food for each of your countries, all consumers with whom we work. If it wasn&#x27;t for the Russian war, you would be in a completely different position now - completely safe. That is why, in order to avoid famine, the efforts of states like Russia to return to the aggressive policy of colonialism must end. The time of empires is over! People have the right to just live, just live and have everything for life. Thank you very much for this opportunity to address you! Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We need to do even more for Ukraine to win - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the opening of the ISPI Global Policy Forum</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-20</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much! First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Giampiero Massolo. I would like to thank you, dear Mr. Mario Monti, for inviting me. Just before I start, I would like to thank you for our students, for finding opportunities, for finding programs, for helping Ukrainians, temporarily displaced persons, our displaced students. This is our future, so we do not want to lose it and therefore we really want them to return to our homeland after receiving your warmth, knowledge, experience. Thank you again for saving our future, our students. Now I would like to address all the participants of the forum. Dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you today. Everything needs to be done today. And so it happened that today is World Refugee Day. Unfortunately, this day has recently become especially painful for all of us, for millions of Ukrainians. To be precise, for more than 12 million of our citizens. Imagine! Those who at the beginning of this year had a home, complete security, plans for the future. And all this was destroyed by the Russian invasion. More than 12 million Ukrainians have become migrants. They left their cities, communities and sought refuge in a safe area. Where at least Russian artillery does not reach. More than 5 million Ukrainians out of these 12 have left our country and found refuge in other countries, including Italy. I would like to thank once again all your people, your cities, your Government and Prime Minister Mr. Draghi for helping our people, especially our women and children. It is very important. But what is our goal now? What do I want to say today? We must do everything we can to ensure that Ukrainian migrants return home. No matter how many of them there are and wherever they seek protection, we must provide them with a real opportunity and internal interest to return to Ukraine. We can set a historical precedent. Earlier, when the aggressor started a war against another state, he hoped that the war would break the victim. And now we have proved that Ukraine cannot be broken. But this is not enough. That is why this is a key element - the ability of people to return home. Due to the Russian war against Ukraine, Europe is experiencing the biggest migrant crisis in decades. When else was it that 12 million people lost their home and security in just a few months? Only World War II comes to mind. Russia has deliberately created such conditions. Mariupol – almost half a million inhabitants. Different cities. Severodonetsk – 100 thousand inhabitants. Volnovakha – 22 thousand inhabitants. So it was. But Russia destroyed everything there. Artillery, aircraft, missiles - they did not spare tools. I can name hundreds of other cities that have already been destroyed. And I can name dozens of other cities that are still threatened by Russian strikes. Now the Russian army is trying to gather forces to attack Kharkiv again. We de-occupied this region. And they want to do it again, and we see it. And there are one and a half million inhabitants. Mykolaiv is constantly being bombed, with almost half a million inhabitants. They want to capture and completely destroy Slovyansk - there were 100 thousand inhabitants before the war. Of course, we will do everything possible to stop the occupiers, to protect the people. But to do it faster, we need support, modern weapons. Such weapons, which have potential greater than that of the Russian army. That is why I spend so much emotion, so much time and so much effort to convince all our partners to give us powerful weapons. It&#x27;s a matter of lives. The second point is the economy. And as long as the war continues, as long as Russian missiles hit our cities, normal economic life is simply impossible. Up to half of our entire economy, up to half of our economic system is not working now. Imagine what it would be like if half of Italy&#x27;s economy was completely blocked. Its industrial part and all your ports. No state can survive such a situation without financial assistance. And when we say that Ukraine needs about $ 5 billion a month to cover the budget deficit, it&#x27;s not just a number, it&#x27;s not about money. It&#x27;s about how many millions of Ukrainians will still have something to live for. Live in Ukraine. The third point is reconstruction. We must do absolutely everything so that after our victory - I have no doubt about it - we would be able not just to restore normal living conditions in the areas where the Russian occupiers tried to leave only scorched debris, but to build a life so modern, so safe that it would affect the aggressor as well. That is, not only sanctions, not only the physical losses of the Russian army on the battlefield, but also the very fact of restoring life in Ukraine. Life itself is a priority. The very fact that we can rise from the ashes. And the aggressor state will remain with losses and degradation only. Our goal is for this migrant crisis in Europe caused unconditionally and solely by the Russian war to be truly the last such crisis. So that any other aggressor does not even think that with the help of war it will be possible to destroy the life of any European country. Weapons for Ukraine, financial support, the future reconstruction of our state - these are three elements that must work to the fullest. But that&#x27;s not all we have to do. The Russian war against us has provoked a global food crisis. If it is not stopped immediately, our 12 million forcibly displaced persons will simply be a drop in the ocean of possible new migration flows. Before this speech, I have just addressed the representatives of the African Union - and I have placed an emphasis on this. On food security. Ukraine can supply food to the world market in the amount to meet the critical needs of dozens of countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Without our exports, there is a deficit, which can lead to chaos. Political chaos, economic chaos, migration chaos. And only this year we can do everything so that on the next World Refugee Day we will not have to discuss how to cope with tens of millions of migrants in Europe and in the regions bordering Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is a special moment now. A moment when the fate of millions of people depends on the decisions of European and world politicians. The moment when it is being decided whether peace will come to Ukraine soon. Therefore, it is being decided whether we will soon be able to say that we are already solving the problems I talked about today. And I urge you - be active! I am grateful to Italy for its principled position. But we need to do even more for Ukraine to win. I repeat - weapons for Ukraine, financial support and reconstruction of our state. Three elements that can change everything. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are moving towards the decision of the European Council on Ukraine&#x27;s candidacy; Russia is very nervous about our activity - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-20</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Step by step, we are going through a crucial week and we are doing everything every day so that no one has any doubts that Ukraine deserves the candidacy. We prove every day that we are already part of a united European, I would even say, value space. Now the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada have already left, and I am here. And you know, I&#x27;d like to thank them today. We often criticize them, but today they did a very good job. I am grateful to all our people’s deputies who supported our European integration. I would like to note the vote in favor of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. This Convention is often called the Istanbul Convention - according to the place of signature. It has been &quot;undermined&quot; in Ukraine for decades. But its main content is simple - it is the obligation to protect against violence and various forms of discrimination. I would also like to thank the deputies who supported the Law on Waste Management. This is an important environmental document. We have been struggling for it for three years. The law has been rejected several times due to oligarchic influence, and now it has been passed. Finally. Thank you. The Anticorruption strategy was approved today. This is also very important. I hope that the Rada will continue to work with the same significant results. I delivered four addresses today. The first was to the participants of the Three Seas Initiative Summit. It is a powerful regional association in Europe. 12 states between the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea. Before addressing, I spoke with President Duda. We coordinated our positions with Andrzej. And at the summit it was decided that Ukraine acquires a status that will allow it to become a full member of the Three Seas Initiative. For us, these are significant economic opportunities, modernization of transport, communications and networks. This is another line of close cooperation between Ukraine and the EU states. By the way, we have good news from our border with Poland. In the framework of the Open Border project, the capacity of the Krakovets’-Korczowa checkpoint has been increased by 50 percent. This will significantly increase the export-import flow across the border. Modernization awaits other checkpoints on the borders with the European Union. And it is tangible, and not only for us. Allows doing global things. Fighting the food crisis provoked by Russia&#x27;s blockade of ports. I spoke about it in an address to the leaders of the African Union. I stressed that this crisis is artificial - it would not exist if it was not for the Russian war against us. I also stressed that we can ensure the supply of agricultural products in the amount that will definitely guarantee the security of Africa, the security of Asia. In general, we are expanding the capabilities of our state. Like all powerful European countries, we need our own policies towards Africa, Latin America, South-East Asia and other parts of the world that were previously left out of proper attention of Ukraine&#x27;s foreign policy. We are working on the agency of Ukraine. I also addressed the participants of the Global Policy Forum in Italy. Very influential meeting. I talked about how to bring all Ukrainian migrants home. Today I met with Ben Stiller, a well-known actor and UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador who is engaged in providing assistance to displaced persons and refugees. I am grateful to Ben for his constant attention to the needs of Ukrainians. I met with President of the General Confederation of Italian Industry Carlo Bonomi. We talked about the ties between Ukrainian and Italian business. I am grateful for the opening of the Confederation&#x27;s office in Kyiv. And the shortest, but very important address was made to the participants of the International Festival of Creativity in Cannes - the largest such event in the world. The Cannes Lions is a special audience. These are people who know how to control attention and who are very much needed in Ukraine right now. The longer the war lasts, the harder it is to compete for the attention of hundreds of millions of people in different countries. But I will do everything possible so that attention to Ukraine does not fade. I called on the most creative people in the world to be our allies in this. And I know that the response in Cannes was very positive. The next days of the week will also be busy. We are moving towards the main decision of the European Council, which will be adopted on Friday. As I predicted, Russia is very nervous about our activity. Again shelling of Kharkiv, Odesa, again attempts of brutal offensive actions in Donbas. This is an evil that can only be appeased on the battlefield. We are defending Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. This whole region is the most difficult, there are the hardest battles. But our strong boys and girls are there. The occupiers receive responses to their actions against us. I am grateful to the army and intelligence that provide it. In the evening I signed another decree on awarding our defenders. 220 combatants were awarded state awards. 27 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who defend our state! Glory to you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I believe that the power of human creativity is greater than the power of a nuclear state - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Cannes Lions International Festival</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-21</span></div>
  <p>Greetings from Ukraine, Cannes Lions! These days I was on the frontline. Our brave soldiers, our brave defenders are fighting back against the Russian army. 117 days ago, everything changed for Ukraine. We are defending against a nuclear state that has unlimited access to money and has disregarded any limits on violence. I’ll be honest with you – the end of this war and its circumstances depend on the world&#x27;s attention. And that&#x27;s why I need allies. We need people like you. You are the most creative people in the world – always on the cutting edge. Whether it’s the Refugee Flag or the Fearless Girl, the Ice Bucket Challenge or the Rivers of Light – every time you find words and images to reach the depths of the human soul, you make people talk about issues everyone would otherwise overlook. I am sure that you will do a lot more to promote Ukrainian bravery. Your campaigns and your work will make our fight for freedom legendary. Because we are fighting not only for our own freedom but for the freedom of the entire democratic world; for all of those who cannot even imagine the extent of tyranny and censorship that exist in Russia. Now you can bring peace to Europe simply by applying your professional qualities. I believe that the power of human creativity is greater than the power of a nuclear state that is stuck in the past. Speak of Ukraine! Don&#x27;t let the world switch to something else! The world must remember that Ukraine is fighting for freedom. This fight must end in our victory as soon as possible. Your every success will mean saving thousands of lives. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every day we fight for a positive decision of the European Union on the candidacy for Ukraine and for the supply of modern weapons - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-21</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a day of extremely active foreign policy activity - almost a marathon of phone conversations. We are increasing the number of those who stand for Ukraine’s candidacy and adding confidence that the decision on Friday will be positive. Slovakia. In a conversation with Prime Minister Heger, we coordinated our positions on the eve of the session of the European Council. Lithuania. I thanked President Nausėda for the decision of the Three Seas Initiative Summit to grant Ukraine the status of a partner-participant. We also coordinated our steps. Hungary. There was a very fruitful conversation with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. I invited him to visit Ukraine and thanked him for the important support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. We agreed to develop cooperation in the energy sector. Portugal. We agreed with Prime Minister António Costa to involve his country&#x27;s experience in our rapprochement with the European Union. Next - Denmark. I expressed gratitude for supporting Ukraine, including with weapons. I also noted the speech of Mrs. Frederiksen in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, which took place today. Spain. In a conversation with Prime Minister Sánchez I noted that our cooperation would strengthen both Ukraine and the entire European Union. The possible outcome of the NATO Summit in Madrid, which will take place in late June, was discussed. Ireland. I noted Ireland&#x27;s active support for our European integration and invited Irish Prime Minister Martin to visit Ukraine. Croatia. I am confident that we can expand our cooperation both bilaterally and at the level of European structures. I thanked Prime Minister Plenković for his support of Ukraine. I was happy to see in Kyiv a great friend of our state - Prime Minister of Luxembourg Bettel. And I would like to draw your attention once again to the assistance from Luxembourg. 15% of the defense budget of this state – this was a contribution to the defense of Ukraine. Both the greatness and the nobility of the state are immediately felt. Today, Mr. Bettel visited the cities of the Kyiv region that had been liberated from the occupiers. I am grateful to him for his sincere understanding of our people and for Luxembourg&#x27;s readiness to take part in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. My schedule for tomorrow is as busy as today. I will do my best to ensure that the historic decision of the European Union is adopted. This is important for us. By the way, today, without delay, I signed the law on ratification of the Istanbul Convention adopted yesterday. Protecting all people from violence and discrimination is our principle. In all negotiations, I always emphasize that the seventh package of the European Union sanctions is needed as soon as possible. Russia must feel a constant increase in pressure for the war and for its aggressive anti-European policy. Another Russian threat to Lithuania, another wave of energy pressure, another batch of lies from Russian officials about the food crisis are all arguments to agree on the seventh package of sanctions. The situation on the frontline is without significant changes. With the help of tactical moves, the Ukrainian army is strengthening its defense in the Luhansk region, which is really the toughest area right now. The occupiers are also putting serious pressure on the Donetsk direction. In the Kharkiv region there is brutal and cynical Russian artillery shelling. It will not give anything to the occupiers, but the Russian army is deaf to any rationality. It simply destroys, simply kills - in this way it shows its command that it is not standing still. In the south we defend our Mykolaiv region, our Zaporizhzhia, and gradually liberate the Kherson region. And just as actively as we fight for a positive decision of the European Union on the candidacy for Ukraine, we fight every day for the supply of modern weapons for our country. We do not decrease our activity for a single day. The lives of thousands of people depend directly on the speed of our partners - on the speed of implementation of their decisions to help Ukraine. Today I signed two major decrees on awarding our defenders. At the request of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 210 combatants were awarded, 3 of them posthumously. At the request of the Minister of Internal Affairs, 255 warriors of the National Guard of Ukraine were awarded, 41 of them posthumously, 41 border guards, 12 of them posthumously, and 45 policemen. And I want you to realize that when I talk about signing such decrees, it&#x27;s not just a routine and not something mechanical. It is only thanks to the mass courage and wisdom of our people on the battlefield that Ukraine lives and can really count on victory. Eternal glory to all who fight for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the Embrace Ukraine - #StrivingTogether charity telethon, which took place in Amsterdam</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-22</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and gentlemen! Greetings from Kyiv! We are just days away from the European Union&#x27;s historic decision on Ukraine. And I am sure that none of us – none of you – have any doubt that Ukraine should get a positive decision. We deserve it! And we deserve it not only for our bravery and our fight for freedom. Russia&#x27;s attack on Ukraine has restored to our memory the worst pages of history. Russian bombs are destroying cities. Russian soldiers are killing thousands of civilians. Russia is even carrying out mass deportations of Ukrainians. What is this? This is Russia&#x27;s attack against the whole free Europe – against our common values. Against human rights, the rule of law and conventions that protect everyone in Europe and the world. We will not allow to destroy our values! I believe that together we can end the war with our victory as quickly as possible and we will rebuild everything Russia has destroyed. United Europe is definitely stronger than any tyranny! Even during such a brutal war, Ukrainian democratic institutions have been preserved. Even now we are extending the reach of the European values – yesterday the Ukrainian Parliament ratified the Istanbul Convention. And no matter how much pressure Russia puts on us, we remain confident that Europe&#x27;s future is bright and free, because we all stand together to protect it! I am grateful to all those who support us. Thank you for this sincerity, Amsterdam! Looking forward to a positive European decision for Ukraine! Embrace Ukraine, strengthen Europe! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>We are fighting for our future, our freedom, our land and the opportunity to build a new Ukraine - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the student community of major Canadian universities</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-22</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! We are ready to amaze the world! I said these words in Toronto, at the Conference on Reforms in Ukraine, 3 years ago. Who could have imagined that 3 years later, the subtext and meaning of these words would undergo a &quot;large-scale reform”. 3 years ago, describing my vision of change in Ukraine, I gave the example of a team that you all know very well. This is the Toronto Raptors. 2019 NBA Champions. To win when no one expects that. To do the impossible by uniting. That&#x27;s how I described our state goal and the common task of all Ukrainians. Who could have imagined that 3 years later it would sound completely different. Who could have imagined how big the difference would be between these times, between then and now, between the summer of 2019 and the summer of 2022. Those were different times. We strived for slightly different victories. We were building a slightly different state. A country of transparent institutions, equal and fair rules, successful and free people. Today, the walls of our buildings are &quot;transparent&quot; in the literal sense of the word - destroyed by Russian missiles and bombs. The rules of the game apply to everyone, but in a different sense. These are the rules of survival. They are equal, but not fair. Tough, cruel and simple. Shoot on the front, help in the rear. You hear an air alarm go down to the shelter. You hear the sound of enemy military equipment, stand up for the defense of your country. In 2019, I talked about peace in the east of Ukraine - a lot was said with Chrystia (Freeland - ed.) and Justin Trudeau - the liberation of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. We did everything possible for this, on all existing platforms, with the help of all existing diplomatic tools. Ukraine sincerely wanted and strived for this. But the other side wanted and strived for something else. We saw this &quot;something else&quot; in the morning of February 24. As a result, in 2022, Mariupol, Kramatorsk, Severodonetsk, Berdyansk, Melitopol and dozens of other cities and villages of Ukraine joined the words peace, liberation, Donetsk and Luhansk. We conducted the Crimea Platform. Today we are fighting back the aggression of the Russian Federation so that in the future there is no need to hold the Kherson Platform, the Mariupol Platform, the Kharkiv Platform and dozens of other platforms for the deoccupation of Ukraine&#x27;s sovereign territories. Three years ago, my goal was a major infrastructure reform. Ukraine started the Large Construction. And it was impressive. Three years later, Russia launched a special military operation. We restored and created new roads, bridges, kindergartens, schools, hospitals, stadiums. Russia has been creating missiles and bombs all this time to destroy it all. Three years ago, in Toronto, I also talked about the restoration of Donbas. To do this, we gathered hundreds of investors and companies from around the world in Donbas and held a forum in Mariupol. Three years later, this city does not actually exist. It is erased from the face of the earth. In 2019, we talked about reconstruction in the east of Ukraine. According to preliminary estimates, this required about $ 10 billion. At the time, that figure seemed shocking. Three years later, it has grown exponentially, and now we need hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild. Now, in addition to the east, we are talking about the south, north, center and west of our country. Ukraine and Canada are separated by the ocean and 7 thousand kilometers, but there is a full mutual understanding between us. Ukraine and Russia are separated by a common border, but there is a huge abyss between us. In words, actions and most importantly - values. In 2019, I spoke about my dream country. About a state where the highest value is a person. In 2022, we are fighting against the aggressor whose highest value is weapons. My goal was large-scale digitization of Ukraine. And we became a State in a smartphone. The goal of Russia is large-scale occupation of Ukraine. And we became a country in army boots. A country in tanks, aircraft, ships. A country in trenches and shelters. Our way of life changed, but not our worldview. The path by which we are going to the goal changed, but the goal remained the same. Lecturers of our universities sometimes lecture their students from trenches, online, via Skype. Our teachers record video lessons and tasks for pupils in the subway, during the air alarm siren. Our servicemen can get married via Zoom without leaving the frontline positions. 3 years ago our goal was real decentralization. 3 years later the goal of Russia became “denazification” that no one understands. 3 years ago we spoke about capable local self-government. 3 years later we are talking about powerful territorial defense. Those were different times, but our goals remained the same. The only amendment is that to implement all this we are today fighting against the second army of the world. We are fighting for our future, our freedom, our land. Just as 80 years ago, during World War II. Today is a special day in Ukraine. The day when we recall the feat of our ancestors, express gratitude to them for our life and the opportunity to build a new Ukraine. The day of mourning and honoring the memory of the war victims, which we mark on June 22. Exactly on this day in 1941 the Nazis started bombing Kyiv. At 4 am. Those were different times, a different occupation, a different war, but our morale, striving for freedom, struggle and our goal haven’t changed. And on February 24, 2022, when Russian missiles hit Kyiv and the whole of Ukraine also at 4 am, we stood up for our country. Today, we are fighting for the future of our children and grandchildren, for their life and opportunity to build a new Ukraine. We have already amazed the world. We have united to do the impossible. We will definitely win, although no one expected that. For the sake of our peaceful, free and democratic future. And these will be different times. What exactly and how we will cover the path to them - I think we will discuss that today here. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you for the meeting. Thank you for your support, Canada. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>To liberate our land and achieve victory is our national goal, which we must work on every day - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-22</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, June 22, is the Day of Mourning and Remembrance of the Victims of War. That war. A war that was to remain forever in the history of the XX century and was never to be repeated. But it is repeated. Today there is no shortage of words that Russia did the same on February 24 as the Nazis did on June 22. Much has been said about this. And I want to add only one thing. Then 1418 days passed from the morning of the invasion to the defeat of the aggressor. We must liberate our land and achieve victory, but faster. Much faster. This is our national goal, and we must work to achieve it on a daily basis. Not only the state, but also every citizen - at the level at which it is possible. From the very morning I continued the telephone marathon for a positive decision on the candidacy for Ukraine. 11 leaders today. Bulgaria. I thanked Prime Minister of Bulgaria Petkov for supporting Ukraine and the development of the whole of Europe with our participation. Latvia. We discussed with Mr. Prime Minister Kariņš the cooperation between our countries, between Ukraine and the European Union, as well as our joint opportunities to protect Europe from the crises that Russia organizes, including the food crisis. Greece. I was glad to hear the words of sincere support for Ukraine. Mr. Prime Minister and I have the same vision of the historical significance of the decision that is expected from the European Council. Sweden. Prospects for bilateral cooperation and cooperation at the level of European structures were discussed with Prime Minister Andersson. Estonia. Thanked Mrs. Prime Minister Kallas for her continued support of Ukraine. The priorities of our cooperation and the agenda in the context of the NATO Summit in Madrid next week were discussed. Czech Republic. Fruitful conversation with Mr. Prime Minister Fiala. The priorities of the Czech presidency of the Council of the European Union in the next six months were discussed. And now I am sure that the voice of the Czech Republic is in favor of Ukraine. Belgium. I thanked Mr. Prime Minister De Croo for supporting our European perspective and invited him to visit Ukraine. I hope that Belgium will take a significant part in the post-war reconstruction of our country. Austria. I am grateful to Chancellor Nehammer for the political and humanitarian support, for understanding the needs of Ukraine. We can do a lot to develop relations between our states. Slovenia. We agreed with Mr. Prime Minister Golob that we can strengthen cooperation between our countries. I thanked him for the consistent support of the candidacy for Ukraine. Moldova. I spoke with President Sandu. We supported each other on the eve of an important meeting of the European Council. And we will help each other to complete this path to the European Union faster. Today I spoke again with President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda. I expressed full support to him over the situation around the Kaliningrad region of Russia. Tomorrow I will continue this marathon - we must provide maximum support to our state. We expect a key European decision tomorrow night. The occupiers struck at Mykolaiv, seven missiles. Fortunately, no one was killed. Five people were injured. There were strikes at the Kharkiv region as well. There are casualties. There were strikes at the borders of the Chernihiv and Sumy regions. In Donbas there are massive air and artillery strikes. The goal of the occupiers in this direction remains the same - they want to destroy the whole Donbas step by step. Entire. Lysychansk, Slovyansk, Kramatorsk - they aim to turn any city into Mariupol. Completely ruined. That is why we repeatedly emphasize the acceleration of weapons supplies to Ukraine. Parity is needed on the battlefield as soon as possible to stop this devilish armada and move it beyond the borders of Ukraine. I am grateful to the United States for its assistance in investigating war crimes in Ukraine. I am grateful to Mr. Eli Rosenbaum for his willingness to join in the establishment of justice - he is one of those American investigators who managed to expose many Nazis. Our joint investigation team must be as strong as possible so that none of the Russian criminals avoid punishment. And this will be one of the largest contributions to the protection of international law and order of our time. Just as September 1, 1939 and June 22, 1941 ended in Nuremberg trials, February 24, 2022 must end in a fair tribunal. Russia must be held accountable for all the evil it has brought to Ukraine. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 195 combatants were awarded state awards, 17 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! We are preparing for the historic decision of the European Council, there are only a few hours left. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the community of major educational institutions of Israel</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-23</span></div>
  <p>Dear students! Dear lecturers! Dear attendees! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for this opportunity. It is an honor for me to address you today. You know, to be honest, I have inquiries - a lot of them - from Israel, in particular from journalists. And I very often disagree. And not just me, frankly speaking. I love your country very much, so I will be honest. I reject these inquiries because, to be honest, sometimes I don&#x27;t know what to say to people. I have often been to Israel, and it is sometimes difficult for me to respond to such inquiries. Why? I think you will understand me when you hear my address. And I think you will draw your own conclusions. You are smart and independent people. So, if it wasn’t for the war, I could visit your wonderful university and talk to you directly with pleasure. But since the beginning of the full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022, I remain in Ukraine, in our capital, in Kyiv. The Office of the President of Ukraine is located in the heart of the city. And if you visit Kyiv, you will definitely come here as well. Also, I&#x27;m sure you will visit some other places in our capital, in our country. If you walk literally 5 minutes down the street from the building where I am now, you will reach the street where the house of Golda Meir’s family was located - one of the most famous, great Israeli women in the world. She was born in Kyiv. I think you know that. And if you spend some more time and walk the streets next to the one where Mrs. Golda Meir lived, you will see the area that Sholem Aleichem, a prominent Jewish writer, liked so much. You will see the addresses where he lived, the houses next to which he felt cozy, and the museum dedicated to him. Kyiv, like many other cities and communities in Ukraine, is full of such places. Places of remembrance for both Ukrainian and Jewish nations. Places that connect us - and it&#x27;s not just historical. It&#x27;s not just plain facts. It is a space of real life of real people, which has forever united our cultures. This is the life in which there is one of the founders of the State of Israel Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and Waldemar Haffkine - one of the most remarkable scientists in human history, who created the first vaccines against plague and cholera. These are the great musician Vladimir Horowitz and the great physicist Abram Joffe. This is Vladimir Jabotinsky, whose mind was so interesting and whose life was so important that his publications are still read today; and this is Natan Sharansky, a politician of the time closer to us, whom we all know well, I personally know him, we all know in both our countries. Of course, these are places of faith without which it is impossible to imagine your culture. In particular, in our city of Uman, which annually received tens of thousands of Hasidic pilgrims. Or in Medzhybizh, where Baal Shem Tov is buried. Of course, these are places of sorrow that all mankind must remember and not forget. The Babyn Yar – a symbol of the Holocaust from bullets, the Drobytsky Yar and other such places on the land of then occupied Ukraine, where the Nazis killed innocent people. We remember all this, we preserve all this. And all this is now under threat. Because how can the places of remembrance be preserved in a total war for the destruction of everything living? Tomorrow, June 24, it will be four months since Russia has launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. And I am sure that each and every one of you has seen that this is a tragedy, has seen what kind of war it is at all, and how Russia is waging it. It destroys our cities. It totally burns down everything in the way of the Russian army or devastates the occupied territories. The main Russian weapons are artillery, air bombs, and cruise missiles. The occupiers do not try to think how to fight. Their tactics are very primitive. They use the maximum of bomb and artillery capabilities so that there is simply nowhere to resist. The Russian army fires missiles at Ukraine every day and every night. The vast majority of them are aimed at ordinary non-military facilities - residential buildings, enterprises, infrastructure, civilians. As of this morning, 2,709 missiles have already been used against Ukraine. And given the pace of their use, very soon the total number will reach 3,000 missiles. These are not unsophisticated missiles. Yes, there are obsolete, Soviet missiles among them, even those of the 1960s. But there are also modern ones. However, there is no selectivity in strikes for Russian missiles, bombs and artillery. That is why, for example, the Menorah in the Drobytsky Yar, which stands there in memory of the Holocaust victims, was also damaged by Russian shelling. They even fired at the Menorah! And should I tell you how many educational facilities the Russian army destroyed in Ukraine? Now you are in one of the wonderful universities, but it is one university - it is very good, but it is one. And imagine 2,000 destroyed educational institutions. How many people are there? Two thousand institutions! Who do you have to be to strike at a university, school or kindergarten with artillery? Russia has become a terrorist state. That&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m sure you all know what the Russian army did to our city of Mariupol. In fact, this city no longer exists. And just four months ago, half a million people lived there. Now there are tens of thousands left in the scorched ruins. And they are threatened by infections that are simply impossible to imagine in today&#x27;s world. In particular, an infection of cholera that Waldemar Haffkine fought against a hundred years ago. Mariupol is a city where now, week after week, the Russian occupiers are hiding traces of crimes, burying the remains of murdered people in mass graves. The Russian army did the same to Volnovakha and dozens of other towns and villages in Ukraine. And what is happening in the territories where the occupiers managed to enter quickly? Civilians are executed there, refugees are killed on the roads. People are tortured there. People are raped there, including minors - both girls and boys. The Russian troops have set up &quot;filtration camps&quot; in which people are tormented. Thousands were killed or mutilated in such camps. The occupiers carry out deportation of Ukrainians to Russia, scattering them in remote regions. And only a few manage to return to Ukraine through the territory of third countries. The number of forcibly displaced persons in our country in just four months is more than 12 million people. 12 million people! Nowhere in Europe in 77 years since World War II has there been anything similar to what Russia has done. Well, tell me how is it possible not to help the victim of such aggression? I ask you this question because I know that you do care, as well as millions, tens, hundreds of millions of people on our planet. So, I will return to where I started my address, to why I rarely, really rarely communicate with journalists when there are inquiries from Israel. I think you will understand. It&#x27;s difficult for me. I do not know what to say to these distinguished persons. I do not know how to answer the questions I often hear. The questions: what help did Israel provide? And how else can we help? All journalists from all countries ask such questions. I just don&#x27;t know what to say. Of course, I am grateful to the people of Israel, I am grateful to you for the sincere and emotional support for Ukrainians. I am grateful for all the Ukrainian flags that appeared on your streets - we see it all, we appreciate it all. For all the words that sounded in our support in your society. I am grateful to your great people. But we would like to get support from your government. It seems fair to me. For example, the geographically small state of Luxembourg, with a population of around 600,000, has provided us with defense support in the amount of 15% of its defense budget. The Baltic states - small, neighboring states - provided significant help when they sent us the necessary weapons. Maybe it was not much, but they gave us almost everything since the beginning of the Russian invasion. What about Israel? We understand that it is not easy for you, but we would very much like to write down in that column in front of your state in the tables about the assistance to our army - what we received. We would like to write something down there. We can also look at Poland. This state - like, by the way, the Baltic states - is under direct Russian military threat. It provides us with vital logistical assistance, it sheltered two and a half million Ukrainian migrants fleeing the war. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Denmark and many, many other countries shelter our people... Democratic countries - everyone did their best to shelter Ukrainian families - we are grateful to them. Most are women with children. They were fleeing the war, seeking refuge. Ireland, with which our culture has no such deep ties as with the culture of Israel, the people of Israel, the history of Israel, has even abolished the visa regime for Ukrainians so that they can simply come and save their lives and their children. Japan, Canada - they made it easier for us to enter. And the Israeli government has suspended the visa-free regime. This is happening right now. I do not want to judge that, I have no right. I have absolutely no right. This is the choice of each and every state. I just want you to think about it yourself. As for sanctions. When countries around the world impose sanctions on Russia, it&#x27;s not about money, it&#x27;s not about business. It&#x27;s about values. It&#x27;s about general security. It is about the fact that anyone who wants to destroy another nation must be held accountable. Japan - supported, Australia, the United States - many countries and many European states are working together - with us against Russian aggression. And, unfortunately, we have not yet seen Israel join the sanctions regime. However, I would like to thank you for the medications you sent to our country. Unfortunately, I have nothing to say about most of the items of the necessary assistance from Israel to Ukraine. Of course, we have such a situation with several states. It&#x27;s true. But I can&#x27;t tell them what I&#x27;m telling you. Why? Please remember our ties! How close we are. And how we should understand each other. And how we feel that your society understands these needs. I do not know why there is such a situation and misunderstanding with some government officials. That is why I have decided to tell you this today - I am not indifferent to the future relations between our states and nations. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m telling you this openly - face to face. I am sure that the war will end. We will win this war. And we have a common future. The great future of great nations, because we have such a great history, a great past. We will have to look each other in the eyes for many, many years to come. Especially your generation, because students are the future and it&#x27;s wonderful. That&#x27;s why I composed my address this way. So that you can draw conclusions and so that we can hear each other. With great respect for the history of Israel, for the people of Israel, for all of you. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This is the biggest step towards strengthening Europe that could be taken right now – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the EU Summit after granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-23</span></div>
  <p>Greetings to all our friends, all leaders-friends of Ukraine! Greetings to all who support freedom! That is how I began my address to the European Council on March 24, three months ago, when I urged you to support us. And that’s quite a path we have come in these three months! All of us together: Ukraine, your states and the European Union as a whole. This path is not politics. I believe this is what will always be the starting point of Europe&#x27;s new history. Europe without division. Europe without &quot;gray&quot; zones. Europe that is truly united and that knows how to defend itself, its values, its future. Today you have adopted one of the most important decisions for Ukraine in all 30 years of independence of our state. However, I believe this decision is not only for Ukraine. This is the biggest step towards strengthening Europe that could be taken right now, in our time and in such difficult conditions, when the Russian war is testing our ability to preserve freedom and unity. On the fifth day of Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against Ukraine, we applied to join the European Union. We provided extremely fast and high-quality answers to the questionnaire we received from the European Commission. And here is the desired result today. Today, I would like to reaffirm that Ukraine is capable of becoming a full-fledged member of the European Union. Then, three months ago, I addressed each country of the European Union and indicated at what stage we were, as I thought, in our relations. And today I would like to tell each and every one of you personally what our people feel, and in the same order as it was then. Lithuania stands for us. Thank you, Mr. President! Gitanas, you know how grateful Ukraine is to your people and to you personally. Latvia stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I believe that together we will be able to strengthen the international legal order. Estonia stands for us. Thank you, Mrs. Prime Minister Kallas! By helping one, we help everyone. Estonia has done a lot. Poland stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! Your state, your people, your President - all of you on this path to Europe are truly brothers with us. France stands for us. Thank you, Emmanuel! You can be sure that with Ukraine, Europe will really be able to be among the global leaders in the XXI century. Slovenia stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I am grateful for the unwavering protection of the common European cause. Slovakia stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! We have to continue to protect each other, it makes us really strong. The Czech Republic stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I believe that we will also be together on the path to Ukraine&#x27;s full membership in the EU. Romania stands for us. Thank you, Mr. President! Klaus, our cooperation in the region and in European structures can indeed become one of the foundations of global stability. Bulgaria stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! Thank you for choosing the side of good in the confrontation that began on February 24 without hesitation. We know it&#x27;s not easy for you. Greece stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! And I’m personally thankful to the Greek people, your country, which I really love. Germany stands for us. Thank you, Olaf! Thank you for your support at a crucial moment. Portugal stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! Your country knows our people well. And I am sure that we will only increase positive ties between us. Croatia stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! And thank you for the help with the experience we use to protect our freedom. Sweden stands for us. Thank you, Mrs. Prime Minister! Blue and yellow truly always stand together! Finland stands for us. Thank you, Mrs. Prime Minister! Your willingness to resist aggression is simply amazing! The Netherlands stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! You can be sure that your choice of Ukraine will definitely strengthen our common European freedom, the rule of law and our unity in diversity. Malta stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! The voice of your island makes the European community complete. Denmark stands for us. Thank you, Mrs. Prime Minister! Be sure that the protection of European values will only increase with Ukraine. Luxembourg stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! We truly understand each other, and your energy inspires us to future victories. Cyprus stands for us. Thank you, Mr. President! Thank you for the choice in favor of our people and our values. Italy stands for us. Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister! Thank you for your strength, for your perseverance. Thank you for proving that the principles of decent people are truly the foundation of Europe. Spain stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I believe that we can significantly strengthen our relations. Belgium stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! We hope that after our victory we will be able to see each other often in Brussels on common European affairs. Austria stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Chancellor! I am convinced that we will be able to make Europe even safer and historically the most stable. Ireland stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! This is a historic rapprochement of our nations. Your personal leadership is truly impressive. Hungary stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you, Viktor, together we are capable of much more than alone! Mrs. President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola! We are grateful to you personally and grateful to the European Parliament! You were the first to support Ukraine&#x27;s candidate status the day after our application. Mr. President of the European Council, dear Charles, Mrs. President of the European Commission, dear Ursula, I am grateful to you both for the leadership that has led us all to this day. I am grateful for the sincere help, for the faith in Ukraine, in Ukrainians, in all of us. I have always said that we, Ukrainians, believe in the European Union. Although we remained formally outside the European Union, our country probably had the largest number of flags of a united Europe. They were in the hands of our people during the revolutions. They have been in the hands of our people in the trenches since 2014. I believe that the flag of the European Union will be in every Ukrainian city that we have yet to liberate from the occupation of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian and European flags will also be together when we will be rebuilding our state after this war together. And today in the framework of our joint meeting – the summit of all European leaders, I would like to express special gratitude to our heroes - each and everyone who defends the independence of Ukraine with weapons in their hands, defends the freedom of Europe. Thank you! Thank you for making possible a new history of Ukraine, a new history of Europe - even stronger, even freer. Thank you all so much! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Officially recognized: Ukraine is a future equal partner for 27 EU countries - address by the President, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada and the Prime Minister</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-24</span></div>
  <p>Fellow citizens of Ukraine! Dear Ukrainian people! 120 days ago, Russia launched a full-scale war against us. For 120 days, Ukraine and its people have heroically been defending their land and their freedom. They are fighting back one of the largest armies in the world. The aggressor, whose population is three times larger than ours, and the area is almost 30 times bigger. Therefore, each of the 120 days of our struggle is historic. But this day is special. Ukraine has officially received the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. We have heard many statements from many politicians over the years about the course to Europe and the strategic importance of this course. We are not politicians, and we do not have many years, so we have moved from statements to action. From dreams to action. And on February 28, Ukraine applied for EU membership. On Bankova Street, in the Office of the President of Ukraine, in the middle of fortifications and sandbags, in the pauses between the sirens of the air alarm, we signed a document. Many people were skeptical, and considered Ukraine&#x27;s chances illusory. But we all united. Ukraine united. And the world saw our unique feature: the less they believe in us, the better we perform. Instead of thousands of words, thousands of slogans about moving to the EU, we filled in thousands of pages of the European Commission&#x27;s questionnaire. What other countries spend a few years doing, we did in a few weeks. At the summit in Brussels, the leaders of the 27 EU member states adopted an official decision: Ukraine receives the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. And today I want to give a series of answers honestly, clearly and comprehensively for everyone. Fill in our questionnaire. Explain in human language what exactly happened and why it is so important. What does this mean for us and what does this mean for Ukraine? What does this mean and what does it give to Europe? What next? What will we do? What do our partners expect from us? What do we expect from partners? What do we expect from you as a society? And why will we definitely succeed? First, candidate status is not just a new step. This is a new summit. Not a new paragraph, not a new page or even a new section. This is a new volume in the history of Ukraine&#x27;s European integration, which we started writing today. And as of today, this book has no other options but one: Ukraine will become a member of the EU in the future. As of today, this is fixed at the official level. Candidate status is a mandatory step that most countries have gone through. This is a point of no return. It&#x27;s not just a new name or a new sign. This is a new status and a new image. Today it is recognized: Ukraine is not a bridge, not a pillow between the West and Russia, not a buffer between Europe and Asia, not a sphere of influence, not a &quot;gray&quot; zone, not a transit territory. Not the border between orcs and elves. Ukraine is a future equal partner for at least 27 EU countries. Chairman of The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk: EU candidate status is a recognition of our achievements in becoming a mature democratic European society. The strengths of our institutions that continue to work effectively even in times of full-scale war. This is a powerful political message. It will be heard by soldiers in the trenches, every family that was forced to flee the war abroad, everyone who helps bring our victory closer. But it will also be heard in the bunker. We can&#x27;t change geography. Russia will continue to be our neighbor. But that decision has changed history. And in this case, history has defeated geography. Behind us is a column of Magdeburg law. It was installed in the place where Volodymyr the Great christened Kyivan Rus’-Ukraine. Hundreds of years later, this column was fortified with protective shields against Russian bullets and shells. It is an eloquent symbol of how they want to destroy our culture, our faith, our law. Our history. But history will win. The future will win. Ukraine will win. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal: Candidate status is a high evaluation of the market transformations that have enabled us to integrate into the EU economy in the energy, digital, customs, transport and other key sectors. These are new perspectives and new opportunities for Ukraine. Access to new EU financial support programs. These are new investments, new projects, new jobs, and support for post-war reconstruction. From now on, our state not only will adopt the European experience, but also will be able to influence the formation of sectoral policies of the European Union. From now on, the process of Ukraine&#x27;s integration into the EU has become irreversible. From now on, Ukraine has a legal place in the European family. And relations between us and the EU are moving from the neighborhood policy to the enlargement policy. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Even simpler. In the plane of not political, but human relations. Obtaining candidate status is an engagement. A serious step in the relations between Ukraine and the EU. This is not just friendship, not sympathy, but a firm and official intention to become one in the future. In the near future. And as of today, Ukraine will be able to join the work of certain bodies and new EU programs, access to which is limited to third countries. Today we have got rid of this humiliating definition. Ukraine has never been like that in essence, but the official terminology called us that. We got rid of it. We are not a third country. Not a tenth, not a hundredth, we are a future member of the European Union. Today is an important day. We hear the Ode to Joy. Joy, but not euphoria. There is a lot of work ahead. The work of everyone in their place. The cohesion of all branches of government and society is our key to success. Despite the war, we continue to implement EU legislation, norms and rules in all spheres of life. The government will develop an appropriate roadmap. The next steps are known - we have the recommendations of the European Commission. We expect the Verkhovna Rada to approve European integration laws as a matter of priority. We expect all of you to have high civic consciousness, devotion to our values and awareness that no one will build us a European Ukraine, except us. I would like to emphasize a very important point. We are changing Ukraine for ourselves, not for someone else. We are implementing reforms not because of someone&#x27;s demands, but because of our own beliefs. Ukraine seeks not to join, but to return to the European family. In 2014, the Ukrainian people withstood and defended its European future. But it has chosen it much earlier. Because democracy existed here more than a thousand years ago. In the days of Kyivan Rus’, when people joined in solving important issues in veche. Human rights, human life have already been valued a thousand years ago. Kyivan Rus’ is probably the only medieval state where there was no death penalty. 700 years ago there was a widespread legal system of local self-government. 700 years ago Ukrainian cities already had the Magdeburg law. Historians say that the borders of Europe are the outskirts of the last eastern city, which has the Magdeburg law. It did not take root further than the east of Ukraine. 500 years ago, our ancestors chose their own leaders. Hetmans of Zaporizhzhia and Kish otamans were not appointed by the king, tsar, boyars, nobility or aristocracy, but were elected freely and equally by all Cossacks. For centuries, our people have been committed to the principles of tolerance and respect. Hundreds of national communities and representatives of all religious denominations have lived and still live in peace and harmony on our land. Today Ukraine is fighting for its freedom. And this war began just when Ukraine declared its right to freedom. To its choice of its future. We saw it in the European Union. No matter how someone convinced us that no one wanted us there and a happy tomorrow for Ukraine was possible in a completely different union called Customs. And no matter how surprised they were that Ukrainians prefered freedom over cheap gas. We have chosen the path. The path determined by our people, not someone&#x27;s power. Chosen by Maidan Nezalezhnosti, not Red Square. The path the Revolution on Granite fought for in 1990, the Orange Revolution stood on barricades for in 2004 and the Heavenly Hundred gave lives for during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. It was then that the voice of Ukraine sounded loudest. It was there that we firmly chose our path. That is why the Russian Federation appeared on it, annexing Crimea, occupying part of Donbas and later starting a full-scale war against the whole of Ukraine. And that is why this decision of the EU is so important, motivates us and shows: all this is needed not only by us. Having declared our desire to go to the EU, today we finally heard clearly: we are waiting for you! You are welcome! We want to see you as a full member of our family. Hence, all this was not in vain. And our struggle continues not in vain. Ukraine has truly united. Ukraine is truly fighting. Ukraine will definitely win. Truly! Ukraine. Europe. World. Humanity. Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes!</p>

  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-24</span></div>
  <p>Greetings, Glastonbury! The festival resumes this year after a two-year break. The pandemic has put on hold lives of millions of people around the world, but has not broken. We, in Ukraine, would also like to live the life as we used to and enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer. But we cannot do that because the most terrible has happened - Russia has stolen our peace. But! We will not let Russia’s war break us. And we want to stop the war before it ruins people&#x27;s lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America – they are all under threat now. That is why I turn to you for support! Glastonbury is the greatest concentration of freedom these days. And I ask you to share this feeling with everyone whose freedom is under attack. Spread the truth about Russia’s war! Help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of this war. Find our United24 charity platform. And put pressure on all the politicians you know to help restore peace in Ukraine. Time is priceless, and every day is measured in human lives. The more people join us in defending freedom and truth, the sooner Russia’s war against Ukraine will end. Prove that freedom always wins! Thank you. Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine has gained the status of a candidate for the EU membership - it did not fall from the sky, so let’s be proud of it - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-24</span></div>
  <p>Good evening, great people of our state! Today was marked by a discussion of the historic decision of the EU Summit - granting Ukraine candidate status. Since this morning and until this moment, there is a dialogue on television, radio, on the Internet about what it means, what conditions Ukraine has to fulfill, how difficult it will be to fulfill and how many years it will take… And I want to say the following on this day. Let&#x27;s rejoice at least a little. In a quiet, modest way, silently, but rejoice. For ourselves, for our beloved state. Let&#x27;s feel the moment and the taste of this moment. Imagine conquering Everest. You reached the penultimate point. You didn&#x27;t look around, didn&#x27;t even take a breath and talk about the further way to the top. How difficult it will be to overcome the last 1848 meters. Instantly we forgot and devalued our own success. Maybe we should first recall that we have already covered 7,000 meters?! Let’s not be ashamed to talk about our achievements. Let’s not be a nation with a short memory and inferiority complex. We say: Ukraine has been granted EU candidate status. Let&#x27;s say: Ukraine has gained EU candidate status. Did it fall from the sky? Haven’t we endured and done a lot? Today we focus on seven EU requirements. Yes. It&#x27;s true. But does it scare us? No. Because before that we successfully fulfilled hundreds. Let&#x27;s not forget about it. Not for bragging, but for the belief that we will definitely overcome this path. We have covered 7,000 meters, so we will not stop - we will reach our Everest. Let&#x27;s talk at least for a moment not about what awaits us, but about what we managed to do. Because, forgetting about it, we underestimate the significance of this step. There were times when we couldn&#x27;t take tickets in the evening and fly to Europe in the morning. We stood in line. Documents, visas, etc. Remember? A pile of papers that we carried in the file, which were required by all government agencies with officials who did not report to us and did not submit electronic declarations. High-ranking officials, for the control of which there was neither a special body nor a special court. Deputies with immunity. President who could not be impeached. Land that could not just be bought. Sounds wild? It seems it wasn&#x27;t with us, doesn’t it? It was. And not so long ago. But we changed everything. Privatization. Land reform. Open-list voting. Decentralization. NACP, Anticorruption Court, administrative services centers, public services online. Diia. Split. Unbundling. Concession. Common aviation space. Industrial visa-free regime. Deoligarchization. Much has been done. Exactly done! Let&#x27;s not forget that. Let&#x27;s be proud of ourselves. Respect ourselves. And we repelled the Russians. And we will win. Because when we respect ourselves we will be respected by others. Do not rejoice at a slap in the face of Moscow, but be proud of applause for Ukraine. And that&#x27;s why I want to see us in one family. Let it inspire you. We deserved it. Realized it. Smile, please. And may God give us all a quiet night. Well, tomorrow is the battle again. With new strength. With new wings. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No Russian missiles, no strikes can break the morale of Ukrainians - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-25</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! 45 Russian missiles over the night and morning of today. Zhytomyr region, Lviv region, Chernihiv region, Mykolaiv. In the evening - more missiles. Different types, different launch areas... All of them were launched with one goal - to show that Russia allegedly can achieve something, that the Russian army will allegedly succeed. Today marks the fifth month of a full-scale war. The occupiers were going to capture most of our country on the fifth day, but have to stage such a missile show on the fifth month, which does not change anything strategically for Russia. This is such a phase of the war - morally difficult, emotionally difficult. When we know that the enemy will not succeed, when we understand that we will still be able to defend our state, but we do not feel the time limits of this, we do not feel how many more strikes, losses, efforts will be before we see that victory is already on our horizon. For this, Russia needs these missile strikes at cities across the country, artillery and mortar shelling of the border areas of our state, the border areas of the Chernihiv, Sumy regions, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk region. It is not just the destruction of our infrastructure, it is also a very cynical, calculated pressure on the emotions of our people. But it&#x27;s not us who will be overpowered, we will overpower them. No Russian missiles, no strikes can break the morale of Ukrainians. And each of their missiles is an argument in our negotiations with partners. I will take part in the G7 Summit on Monday. The NATO Summit will take place next week. 45 missiles in half a day and just on the eve of such meetings. All clear. Another confirmation of our position. This confirms that sanctions packages against Russia are not enough, that Ukraine needs more armed assistance, and that air defense systems - the modern systems that our partners have - should be not in training areas or storage facilities, but in Ukraine, where they are now needed. Needed more than anywhere else in the world. And one more thing that should be said today after such a missile attack. In the four months of the war, more than 20,000 Ukrainian warriors were awarded state awards. More precisely, 20,463. These are the Armed Forces, the National Guard, border guards, our rescuers, police, intelligence, Security Service, our doctors, State Security Administration, State Special Communications Service, NABU special forces, State Bureau of Investigation and employees of the Judicial Security Service... 156 warriors were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. This is the scale of courage, this is the level of resistance. And if there are more than 20 thousand of those whose feat has already been awarded, what kind of missiles can anyone in Russia hope for? What artillery, what mines can help the occupiers, if they are really opposed by mass people’s resistance? Therefore, all our cities: Severodonetsk, Donetsk, Luhansk - we will return everything. Every week we go to Kherson. Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar and Mariupol were never forgotten. And all other cities of Ukraine that are temporarily occupied will be Ukrainian only. Thanks to our heroes, thanks to each and everyone who does not get tired, who does not succumb to emotional breakdowns, who struggles and who knows that victory is ahead. Our victory, only ours. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine needs a powerful modern air defense, we talk about this with partners everyday - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-26</span></div>
  <p>Unbreakable people of an unbreakable country! Russia today again hit Kyiv with missiles. Early in the morning. The second army of the world triumphantly &quot;defeated&quot; a kindergarten and an apartment building. The man died, he was only 37 years old. There are wounded, among them - a girl named Zhenya, she is seven years old, the daughter of the deceased, now she is in &quot;Okhmatdyt&quot;. Her mother was also wounded. By the way, a citizen of Russia. That’s that. She was not threatened by anything in our country, she was completely safe, until Russia itself decided that everything was equally hostile to them now - women, children, kindergartens, apartment buildings, hospitals, railways. Missiles also hit the Mykolaiv region, the Chernihiv region, Odesa, Cherkasy. Artillery and mortar shelling did not stop in the Kharkiv region, in the Sumy region, in Donbas, in the south of our state. My condolences to the families and friends of the victims. Everyone who was injured is given all the necessary help. Part of the missiles were shot down. But only part. We need a powerful air defense - modern, fully effective. Which can ensure complete protection against these missiles. We talk about this every day with our partners. There are already some agreements. And partners need to move faster if they are really partners, not observers. Delays in the transfer of weapons to our state, any restrictions are actually an invitation for Russia to strike again and again. The occupiers - these terrorists - must be beaten with all our might so that they do not think they can put pressure and outplay someone. What are these missiles about today? And what are yesterday&#x27;s 62 missiles - for only one Saturday, for 24 hours - are about? They are about the Russian method: to escalate every time international events take place. And at the same time they are about determination. About, for example, the fact that the leaders of the G7, who gathered in Germany today for a summit, have enough common potential to stop Russian aggression against Ukraine and against Europe as a whole. It is possible. But this is possible only if we get everything we ask for, and just in time we need it - weapons, financial support, and sanctions against Russia. It cannot be otherwise in this war. Because it is here - in the sky over Kyiv, in the sea near Odesa, on the land of the Kharkiv region, Donbas, in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions - that it is being decided what life will be like in Europe in the future. Here, in Ukraine, and nowhere else. Of course, there are not as many missiles in Russia as we have confidence in ourselves. But Russian weapons can be stopped only by more powerful weapons. I spoke about this today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau - how else we can strengthen defense support for Ukraine and how else we can increase the pressure of sanctions on Russia. I thanked Justin for the help already provided - one of the most tangible. And today I want to say a few more things, very targeted. Firstly, all pilots, dispatchers, mechanics and other people who ensure the launch of missiles at Ukraine must understand: we will find you all. Each of you will be responsible for these strikes. And if someone thinks that he will evade responsibility by saying that such was the order, you are mistaken. When your missiles hit residential buildings, these are war crimes. Trial is what awaits you all. And there will be nowhere to hide for you - neither on the shores of the Caspian Sea, over which your missiles are launched, nor in Belarus... Nowhere. And I would like to separately address the citizens of Belarus today. Both civilians and those in uniform. You are being drawn into the war. And even more actively than in February and in the spring months. The Kremlin has already decided everything for you - your lives are worth nothing to them. But you are not slaves or cannon fodder. You do not have to die. And you can prevent anyone from deciding for you what awaits you next. I know that the people of Belarus support Ukraine, they support us, definitely us, not the war. And that is why the Russian leadership wants to draw you - all Belarusians - into the war, wants to sow hatred between us. A lot now depends on the ordinary people of Belarus. And I know that you can refuse to participate in this war. Your lives belong only to you, not to someone in the Kremlin. Ukraine will defend itself from strikes from any direction and from any weapon. I&#x27;m sure we will endure and get everything back. But anyone, any normal person in any country, in particular in Belarus, can contribute to the protection of life. This week will be very important for all of us. Therefore, we continue to work at all levels and do not slow down. Glory to all who defend the state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia has become the largest terrorist organization in the world, and this must be a legal fact - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-27</span></div>
  <p>This address is without greetings. Today&#x27;s Russian strike at a shopping mall in Kremenchuk is one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history. A peaceful city, an ordinary shopping mall with women, children, ordinary civilians inside... Before the air alarm there were about a thousand people. Fortunately, as far as we know at this time, many people managed to get out in time. They were taken out in time. But there were still people inside: staff, some visitors... Only totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object. And this is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike - exactly at this shopping mall. It is not yet possible to establish the number of victims for now. A fire broke out in an area of more than 10 thousand square meters. The rescue operation continues, but we must be aware that the losses may be significant. As of now, we know about 12 dead and 24 wounded. We are establishing the number of people under the rubble. All the wounded will be provided with all the necessary assistance - Kyiv doctors have already left for Kremenchuk. The Minister of Internal Affairs is already there, he will coordinate all the necessary actions. My condolences to the families and friends of those killed in this terrible terrorist attack. And I ask each and every one - whenever you hear the air alarm siren, go to the shelter. Necessarily. Don&#x27;t ignore it. Russia will stop at nothing. This morning, I appealed to the United States to recognize Russia as a state that sponsors terrorism. The relevant resolution is approved by the US Senate Committee, and the legal decision can be adopted by the Department of State. And such a decision is clearly needed, and it must be supported by the entire democratic world. I told this to the participants of the G7 Summit, which took place in Germany. As of today, Russia has used almost 2,800 different cruise missiles against Ukraine. The number of air bombs and MLRS rockets hitting our cities simply cannot be counted. There were hundreds of thousands of them in the four months of the war. This is nothing but terror. Another brutal shelling of Kharkiv, northern Saltivka took place today. At present, we know about 5 people killed and more than 30 wounded, 5 of them children. All are civilians, no military. The Russian state has become the largest terrorist organization in the world. And this is a fact. And this must be a legal fact. And everyone in the world must know that buying or transporting Russian oil, maintaining contacts with Russian banks, paying taxes and customs duties to the Russian state means giving money to terrorists. I also said today, addressing the leaders of the G7, that our common potential is absolutely enough to defeat the Russian army - it does not know how to fight. All the operations we carry out to deoccupy our territories show one thing: the occupiers are crumbling when we have something to put pressure on them. They do not know how to resist. They are capable only of such vile strikes as those in Kremenchuk or Saltivka today, only of the total thoughtless destruction of all living things as in Mariupol. Therefore, the war may not drag on, if we can really push together and drive the occupiers out of our Ukrainian land. The sooner this happens, the more lives will be saved. Even before the start of a full-scale war, we told our partners that we needed modern missile defense. We repeated this after February 24 as well. People in the Kremenchuk shopping mall deserved security just as much as people in any mall in the world - somewhere in Philadelphia or Tel Aviv, or in a shopping gallery somewhere in Dresden. The world can, and therefore must, stop Russian terror. And now I can already say this - I heard it from our partners: Ukraine must get reliable missile defense, we are expecting the supply of appropriate systems. And there is another important result of the &quot;seven&quot;, which is worth mentioning right now. This has already been officially agreed: the most powerful democracies in the world will support our state as long as necessary for our victory. Ukraine will not be broken! Never. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the occasion of the Constitution Day of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-28</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Unbreakable citizens of an unbreakable country! Great people with a great history! Conscientious society of the state guided by the rule of law! The fact that all of the above is true is proved by many things. Ancient documents and chronicles, historical and legal landmarks, religious traditions and folk customs, science, literature, music, painting, legends and myths, proverbs and sayings, and even news releases. All this in its own way depicts our state and all of us. But there is one thing that, in my opinion, gives the most detailed and objective assessment. This is the Constitution of Ukraine! This is a point of development that we have reached as a state and society over the centuries of history. The government system is our intellect. The form of government shows whether we have moved to the next level of civilization or are stuck in an era of tyranny and dictatorship. The Constitution, like an X-ray, shows our strengths and weaknesses. Our principles, our values, our ideals. The level of freedom and rights that we are willing to defend. The level of maturity and responsibilities we are willing to fulfill. The norms of the Constitution make it possible to decipher the genetic code of our nation. Find the answer to two main questions: what is Ukraine and who are the Ukrainians? This is our detailed portrait. And especially now, during a full-scale war, its main features are clearly visible. We passed the Basic Law of the state 26 years ago. 26 years later, defending our state is the basic law for us. Why? The answer is in the preamble of the Constitution. The principles of its adoption 26 years ago are the principles of our struggle now. They explain why and what we are fighting for. This is the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination, the universally approved independence of Ukraine, the irreversibility of the path to Europe. This is the responsibility to God, to one&#x27;s own conscience, to previous, present, and future generations. We didn&#x27;t start the war, we were not the first to shoot and we were not the first to attack. We defend Ukraine, which is a sovereign, independent, democratic, social and legal state. Taking up arms, we did not hesitate, as at a crossroads. We did not choose whether to defend the first article of the Constitution or to adhere to the first commandment of God. God is on our side, he says that defending your home from evil is not a sin. It is a sin not to defend it. Our sovereignty extends to the entire territory. We are a unitary state. Our territory within the existing borders is integral and inviolable. That is why in the east and west, in the south, in the north and in the center, our people are heroically fighting for these principles and for the second article of our Constitution. Repelling the second army of the world. Which is indifferent to all the threats and risks of World War III. But we are not indifferent to the norms of the third article of the Constitution. A person, a person&#x27;s life and health, honor and dignity, inviolability and security are the highest social values. And our people are defending this principle at the cost of their lives, health and security. With honor and dignity! The norm for us is to protect it. The norm for us is to protect other norms. Land is the main national wealth. Its subsoil, air, water and other natural resources of its territory, continental shelf and sea zone are the property of the Ukrainian people. We will fight for every meter of our land to the last breath. Because only the people can change the constitutional order in Ukraine. No one can usurp state power. We know the term &quot;democracy&quot; well, so we don&#x27;t know what the fifth term is. Our right to protest, assembly and manifestation is a constitutional article, and for others it is a criminal one. State symbols are not symbolic or formal for us. Our state flag is a flag made of blue and yellow stripes. Two sacred colors. The third is not given. As it is not allowed for a foreign tricolor to hoist over our land, in our sky in any way different than with the prefix &quot;temporarily&quot;. Our coat of arms is a sign of the Princely State of Volodymyr the Great. This is a trident. Not two-headed birds. Because this is not going to fly here. Our National Anthem &quot;The glory and freedom of Ukraine has not yet perished…&quot; They live and will live on. Our people in the occupied cities are not afraid to go to peaceful rallies and sing their anthem. Sing out loud. Looking into the eyes of the occupier, sing that they will vanish like the dew in the sun. This nation cannot be defeated! Only exterminated. But even this is impossible. Because we are of Cossack descent! And our state language is Ukrainian. And we respect all other languages. We do not oppress any of them. That is why today people are fighting for Ukraine in Ukrainian, Crimean Tatar, Polish, Russian, Belarusian, Moldovan, Hungarian, Romanian, Georgian and many other languages! Because it is clear without words what evil is. And you can beat it without words. The occupier expected a warm welcome, but faced fierce resistance. Meeting not with bread and salt, but with &quot;Stugna&quot; and &quot;Javelin&quot;, &quot;Bayraktar&quot; and &quot;Neptune&quot;, &quot;Vilkha&quot; and &quot;HIMARS&quot;. Our resistance has lasted for 125 days already. For the world it is the eighth miracle, for the enemy it is the ninth wave, and for us it is the seventeenth article of the Constitution of Ukraine. The defense of Ukraine is the most important function of the state and the matter of the entire Ukrainian people. We have no choice but to defend our choice. It is our obligation to protect our rights. Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. An inalienable right to life that Russia has violated tens of thousands of times and claimed tens of thousands of lives. It is the inviolability of home, which is violated every day and night by its missiles, bombs and bullets. These are rights that are familiar and inalienable to us. This is freedom of speech. That is why Ukrainians are not afraid to tell the enemy &quot;go home.&quot; Because they have freedom of thought. They know how to think, see, hear, understand, distinguish truth from lies. This is the right to vote and to be elected. Impossibility to be arrested for nothing. Freedom of movement. Immunity. These are all children&#x27;s rights. We are fighting for all this today. To defend, liberate and restore. For our future generations to have rights, our generation has no right to give up. We do not have such a desire either. The enemy will not be able to realize the force with which we are ready to fight for our rights and freedoms. He who does not have it himself will never deprive others of it. That is why victory is inevitable for us. Punishment is inevitable for the enemy. And it will come. And peace will come, too. And our children will finally go to school. They know from an early age what freedom and struggle for it are, what rights are, what the Constitution of Ukraine is. And they know what glorious legal ancestors they have. In particular, the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk, which is over 300 years old. It is called the first written Constitution of Europe. And last year it visited home, Ukraine, for the first time. It was exhibited in Kyiv, but it is fair to read it in every corner of Ukraine. To this end, it will be translated from Latin into Ukrainian, and tens of thousands of copies will be sent to Ukrainian schools! We are sure that sooner or later the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk, the Constitution of independent Ukraine, and other subjects of the Ukrainian school will be studied by our happy and smiling children - in Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Kherson, Crimea! Victory is not far off! Victory will be ours! Happy Constitution Day of Ukraine, dear citizens! Glory to you! Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is necessary that Russia stops killing people, it is necessary to bring it to justice for terrorism - speech by the President of Ukraine at the meeting of the UN Security Council</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-28</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! First of all, I would like to thank the Albanian Presidency of the UN Security Council for convening this meeting promptly - at the request of Ukraine - and for the opportunity to address you. Unfortunately, as of now, the United Nations does not have a legal definition of &quot;terrorist state&quot; agreed by all UN member states. But the war that Russia is waging against Ukraine demonstrates not only the meaning of this concept, but also the urgent need to enshrine it legally - at the United Nations level - and to punish any terrorist state. Take a look at the events of just a few days in Ukraine - a few of 125 days of Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against our state. Saturday, June 25, 62 Russian missiles hit our cities. Sunday, June 26, 10 more missiles. In particular, one of them hit a residential complex in the capital of our state, Kyiv. Three floors of an ordinary house were destroyed. Another missile exploded in the yard of an ordinary kindergarten. Monday, June 27, a missile strike at Kremenchuk. The person who carried out this strike knew for sure that he was aiming a missile at an ordinary shopping center, at one of the many shopping malls that exist in any country in the world. As of now, we know about 18 people killed, but this number may unfortunately increase; more than 50 people were wounded, dozens more are on the missing list. 7 fragments of bodies were found: torn off limbs, arms and legs of people torn off by explosion. And if the Russian state claims that these victims are allegedly not from its missile strike, then I now propose to the United Nations to send either a special representative of the UN Secretary General or a plenipotentiary commission to the site of this terrorist attack in Kremenchuk, so that the UN has an independent opportunity to get all the information and see that this is really a Russian missile strike. Yesterday, the Russian army also struck with MLRS at a queue of people standing to get water. It was in the city of Lysychansk, Luhansk region. Ordinary people, civilians. None of them were military. Just a queue to get water. Eight people were killed, including a 15-year-old boy, his name was Danylo. And the oldest among the dead was 68 years old. And I want you to hear now the names of four women killed by this strike: Viktoriya, Iryna, Olena, Liudmyla. Kharkiv suffers brutal Russian strikes almost every day. Just yesterday 9 people were killed, 29 were wounded, 5 children among them. I want you to know their names: Hlib - 12 years old, Oleh - 8 years old, Mykhailo - 11 years old, Hryhoriy - 9 years old, Artem - 10 years old. It was a Russian artillery strike at ordinary residential buildings. Today at 5 am the Russian army also carried out a strike at Mykolaiv and the city of Ochakiv, Mykolaiv region. Three people were killed in Ochakiv. A 6-year-old girl - her name was Yeva. A man named Mohammed, he was 76 years old. And a woman named Halyna, she was 50 years old. Among the wounded there is a baby, a boy, he is only 3 months old, he was born after the beginning of this full-scale Russian invasion, his name is Volodymyr, and his condition is very grave - now he is in intensive care. I emphasize: a baby. A 3-month-old baby. Two more missiles for today - at the city of Slovyansk - it is in Donbas of our state. In the long-suffering Donbas, which Russia has been tormenting since 2014. Just a few hours before my address to you, to the UN Security Council, two missiles hit the Odesa region. The city of Dnipro was also hit, and one of these missiles destroyed a car service station. Not some military station - the usual car service... And I have a question for you, ladies and gentlemen, who among you does not agree that this is terrorism? If in any part of the world any organization killed any civilians just as Russia kills Ukrainians, it would definitely be recognized as terrorism. Such an organization would become an enemy to all mankind. Therefore, what is punished at the level of specific criminals and criminal organizations must not go unpunished at the level of a state that has become a terrorist. Daily terrorist acts. No days off. They work as terrorists every day. The UN Charter confers on the UN Security Council &quot;the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.&quot; Article 6 of Chapter II of the UN Charter clearly states that &quot;A Member of the United Nations who has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.&quot; Although Russia is violating the fundamental principles of the United Nations and the international legal order, it has not yet been held to account at the global level. It still remains in the UN agencies and even enjoys the privileges of the seat it occupies, the seat of the permanent member of the UN Security Council, which Russia occupies solely due to the short-sightedness of the politicians at the end of the Cold War. Russia has no right to take part in discussing and voting in regard to the war against Ukraine, which is unprovoked and simply colonialist on the part of Russia. I urge you to deprive the delegation of a terrorist state of its powers in the UN General Assembly, and that is possible. That is necessary. That&#x27;s right! That&#x27;s fair! Russia has no right to remain in the UN Security Council. And this path is not as thorny, as someone may believe, if you show consistency and proper political will. This is the only logical way for the UN Charter to work and be respected by all members of the Organization. Furthermore, our Organization already has enough power to bring a terrorist state to justice. Chapter VII of the UN Charter allows for the establishment of a special international tribunal to investigate the actions of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil. The word &quot;genocide&quot; has repeatedly been used. And you all saw what the Russian occupiers did in our city of Bucha. Each of you can obtain information on how many mass graves appeared around the city of Mariupol alone after the Russian army razed it to the ground. It was a city of half a million residents! Now there are ruins. In the case of the genocide in Rwanda, the UN Security Council established an International Tribunal within six months since the beginning of the genocide. More than four months have passed since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has been 8 years since the beginning of Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine in Donbas and the occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which has been repeatedly condemned at the level of the UN General Assembly. We need to act immediately - and do everything to make Russia stop the killings of children, people - everyone. It must be brought to justice for terrorism, otherwise it could bring terrorist activity to other European countries, Asia - the Baltic states, Poland, Moldova, Kazakhstan - many nations have already heard threats from Russian officials and state propagandists. I am grateful to all the diligent and civilized states who share our position and help defend the international legal order. This meeting of the UN Security Council was convened after the Russian missile strike at Kremenchuk. But in fact, the meeting of the UN Security Council may not be interrupted at all and go on round the clock day after day to have time to discuss every terrorist act of the Russian state. The UN Charter gives all the levers to influence any violator of the rules of the Organization, any aggressor, any terrorist state. And I urge you to use these levers. It is imperative to deprive the Russian delegation of the opportunity to manipulate the UN. It is imperative to make it impossible for Russia to stay in the UN Security Council until its terrorism continues. It is imperative to establish a tribunal to investigate everything that the Russian troops have done against Ukrainians. And it is imperative to give a legal definition of the notion &quot;state terrorism&quot; at the UN level. All Russia&#x27;s actions must receive a legal assessment - global sanctions for destroying the international legal order. Thank you for your attention and I wish to say just one more thing. Various countries of the world may have different attitudes to war, to any war. But in every country of the world, the memory of the deceased is equally honored. Not just the military, but every person, every child who dies in a tragedy of war. That is the usual thing. People treat with respect and compassion those perished and whose lives were unjustly taken away. Only the killers do not honor the memory of those they killed. And I ask you now - I will be grateful to you - to honor the memory of all Ukrainians who have been killed in this war. All the adults, all our children. Tens of thousands of people. I ask you to commemorate them with a moment of silence. Thank you.</p>

  <h2>Law enforcers and intelligence of Ukraine are doing everything to identify all Russian servicemen who are responsible for terror against our cities - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-28</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! I have just taken part in a special meeting of the UN Security Council convened at the request of Ukraine. Convened by Albania - this state presides in the Security Council. We have taken advantage of all international levers to bring Russia to justice for state terrorism. For everything done by the Russian army against Ukrainians in Kremenchuk, in Ochakiv, in Lysychansk, in Kharkiv, in Dnipro, in many, many other cities of Ukraine. As of this evening, the total number of Russian missiles that have hit our cities is already 2,811. And there are many more air bombs, many artillery shells... The UN Security Council today stood in silence to commemorate all Ukrainians killed by the Russian army on our land. The members of the Russian delegation looked at everyone present in the Security Council and also decided to stand up - just so as not to look like outright murderers. But everyone knows that it is Russian terror, it is the Russian state that is killing innocent people in this war waged against the Ukrainian people. I called on the UN to use the existing mechanisms of the Charter to stop Russian manipulation of the Organization&#x27;s structures and to set up a special tribunal to investigate the actions of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil. Ukraine&#x27;s law enforcement and intelligence agencies are doing their best to identify all Russian servicemen responsible for the terror against our cities. The names, faces and all information about each of these terrorists will be known to the world. None of them will be able to avoid responsibility, and personal sanctions will not be enough for these people. A sentence and imprisonment are the minimum they deserve. And I wish to say separately about the responsibility of those Russian propagandists who lie about this terror, who are trying to justify the actions of the Russian army. Each of you will also be punished. We have all the evidence of what the Russian troops are doing against our people. Today, I want to end this address with one such piece of evidence - so that no one dares to deceive about the missile strike at the shopping mall in Kremenchuk. The Russian missile hit this very object, purposefully. Obviously, that was the order. It is obvious that Russian assassins received such coordinates for this missile. They wanted to kill as many people as possible in a peaceful city, in a regular shopping mall. Here is what happened in Kremenchuk: (Video) And for this act of state terrorism, as for all others, Russia will be responsible. On the battlefield in Ukraine, by the strengthening of sanctions and, of course, in the tribunal. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 314 more combatants were awarded state awards. Eternal glory to our defenders! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>You have to find a place for Ukraine in the common security space - speech by the President of Ukraine at the NATO Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. Secretary General! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today at the NATO Summit, which will be crucial and groundbreaking. Today is really the beginning of a new history. Not just for NATO&#x27;s eastern flank, but for the entire Alliance. For the whole Euro-Atlantic community. In a time of extremely aggressive Kremlin, the world needs an extremely bold Alliance. And I am sure that the next summit in a year will show the results of this summit and what the future of NATO will be. I am grateful once again for this opportunity, and my address to you at the next NATO summit, next year - with my direct participation, not this online format - will be a testament to our common victory. But next year could be a worse situation - if not only Ukraine, but also several other states, possibly members of the Alliance, come under fire from Russia. And then it will be our common failure - Ukraine and NATO. You are all well aware of what Russia&#x27;s goals really are. For many years it has been threatening to start a war. Threatened - if Ukraine joins NATO. But Ukraine is not in NATO, and Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against our state has been ongoing for 126 days - after 8 years of war in Donbas. So why has everyone believed for decades that it was NATO that could provoke Russia into something by its actions? Russia&#x27;s goals are known. They are obvious. The Russian leadership sees the world differently. Not like you. They see Lithuania, for example, not as a member of your Alliance, but as a republic of the Soviet Union. For us, it is an independent state and has long been a former republic of the USSR, for us it is the past, and they see it as a possible future, they want to enslave it again. They consider it that way. They see it that way. And the same goes for every country that is Russia&#x27;s neighbor. For every state that was once under Moscow&#x27;s influence. Only now - at this summit - will you identify Russia as your main threat, but you have been an enemy for them for a really long time already. And the ideology of Russia is based on this, it is reflected one hundred percent in its propaganda, its task is to break you, to put pressure on you. And it is surprising that the work of propagandists, Russian television in some of your countries continues! This is not about freedom of speech. This is a concrete preparation of war against you, within your states. And please look at our state - what it can lead to in yours! Russia&#x27;s tactics are very simple. It destroys everything - houses, shopping malls, schools, hospitals. More than 2,800 missiles since February 24, and the vast majority were aimed at civilian targets! What is it for? What are the bombs for? What are total artillery strikes for? The Russian army is doing everything possible to force as many people as possible to leave their cities. So that there is nothing but ruins. And then the so-called &quot;second army of the world&quot; enters these cities - already empty and already dead. And it does not want to stop in Donbas or somewhere in the south of Ukraine, it wants to absorb city after city, all of us, and then all in Europe, whom the Russian leadership considers its property, not independent states. This is Russia&#x27;s real goal. The question is - who is next for it? Moldova? Or the Baltic countries? Or Poland? The answer is - all of them. The some goes, by the way, with the food crisis - with the blockade of Ukrainian ports, with the famine that Russia is provoking. What is the real target? You! The same! Hunger is a tool, a means. And its real goal is to put pressure on you, and it&#x27;s chaos, it&#x27;s new waves of migration to Europe. Isn&#x27;t that the case with energy? Why is Russia pulling the gas noose? Why is it putting pressure on Europe? For you to ask. For you to be humiliated. For you to be completely dependent. So that you can be forced to give up your freedom, your democracy and your values - for the sake of certain interests of the Russian leadership. We need to see the real goals of Russia. And if they were different, now there would be no desire of Finland and Sweden to join the Alliance - to get common security. Ladies and Gentlemen! While democracies were calling on the Russian leadership to have reason and morality, Russia was accumulating power and missiles. You, the democratic leaders, have urged it to respect international law, but tyrants understand force. And force only! And this is clearly seen in those areas of Ukraine where the Russian army has been severely rebuffed. Ukraine commends the decision on the accession of Finland and Sweden to the Alliance. And it is very good that this has happened now - before Russia could start acting against these states as well. But is Russia doing anything against them now given this decision? No, and you see it. The Russian leadership has publicly stated that the Leningrad streets taught them the rules of life. There, any attempts at dialogue and appeasement are perceived only as weakness and fear. There, you don&#x27;t make a phone call to anyone to talk when you have to hit back. There, you either hit or lose. This is exactly how the Russian state sees the world right now. And this vision cannot be ignored, its true goals cannot be ignored. You need to answer them. And I&#x27;m sure you all know how to respond. In fact, our goals - the goals of Ukraine - are exactly the same as yours. We are interested in security and stability on the European continent and in the world. It is in our interest that the lives of nations are determined not by the infamous Munich speech of one leader, but by international law. We are interested in the absence of any &quot;gray zones&quot; and territories of total war, where there is nothing left but ruins. You are also interested in this. Helping Ukraine end this war by winning on the battlefield now - that is, giving a really strong answer to what Russia is doing - is what we and each of your states and the whole Alliance, the whole Euro-Atlantic community need. If you really identify Russia as your threat, your main threat, you must fully support its main - the first - target. This is not a war of Russia only against Ukraine, this is a war for the right to dictate conditions in Europe. For what the future world order will be like. That is why it is absolutely necessary to support Ukraine right now with weapons, finances and political sanctions against Russia that will stop its ability to pay for the war. Ukraine needs modern missile and air defense - and you have these systems. By providing them to us, you can completely break Russia&#x27;s tactics to destroy cities and terrorize the civilian population of Ukraine. This is a fundamental thing. The distance from Kyiv to Madrid is less than the range of the missiles used against us today. Can one state respond to such a threat without the help of partners? You can provide this help. And we are grateful for the help you have already given. Russia relies primarily on artillery on the battlefield. On artillery superiority. Dozens of times more strikes than we currently can respond with. Ukraine has already received modern artillery systems - and I am very grateful to you. But the war continues and it is a war in which artillery is of great importance. The war should not drag on. To prevent this, we need to break the Russian artillery advantage - a significant advantage, we need much more such modern systems, modern artillery. Financial support for Ukraine is no less important than aid with weapons. Russia still receives billions every day - and spends them on the war. We have a multibillion-dollar deficit - we do not have oil and gas, which could cover it. We need about $ 5 billion a month - you know that, and that&#x27;s a fundamental thing as well. This is exactly what is needed for defense and protection. And we need a new understanding of NATO&#x27;s eastern flank. It is possible to get rid of the &quot;gray zone&quot; and guarantee security only together with Ukraine. Just think about one fact now: today, a non-NATO country, albeit with your support, has been holding back a state that you all officially identify as your main threat for more than four months. We are deterring Russia from destroying us and from destroying you. Ladies and Gentlemen! Russia must be isolated. It should not be in those international structures it wants to destroy. There should be no dialogues that don&#x27;t make sense until it starts looking for that dialogue itself. It must seek dialogue itself, itself, and therefore seek peace. And, for the sake of peace, the understanding of NATO&#x27;s eastern flank must be revised. Is it a coincidence that all Allies in the east, all our neighbors, stand for Ukraine&#x27;s membership in NATO? No, this is not a coincidence. This is logic. This is the understanding of life in our region. NATO&#x27;s open door policy should not resemble the old Kyiv metro turnstiles: they are open, and when you approach, the turnstiles close until you pay. Hasn’t Ukraine paid enough yet? Is our contribution to the defense of Europe and the whole civilization still insufficient? What else is needed then? I can say what we need: we need security guarantees, and you have to find a place for Ukraine in the common security space. There will be either urgent help for Ukraine, which is enough to win, or Russia&#x27;s postponed war with you. You are now adopting the strategy of the Alliance - and this is first and foremost a strategy for the security of your societies, your states. Strategy for ten years. 126 days of full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Cruise missiles, torture, children murdered, women raped... We do not have 10 years. Do you have them? Are you really sure about that? Thanks again for the invitation. Thank you very much for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>144 Ukrainian warriors were returned from Russian captivity, we will do everything to bring everyone home - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-29</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Our defenders! A week ago, our country received the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, and today another step has been taken on the path to membership. A very practical step. &quot;Transport visa-free regime&quot; was signed. This is an agreement that removes barriers for Ukrainian carriers. You no longer have to wait for permits for freight transportation. And this will significantly increase the export of Ukrainian goods by road transport. This is exactly the task of our state now - not to lose a single week in relations with the European Union. Despite this war, despite all the difficulties, we will constantly do what brings us closer to full membership in the European Union. By the way, yesterday I held a special meeting - a big meeting including 28 participants representing the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The state will have a relevant document - a clear map of actions that can be checked by any citizen of Ukraine: what needs to be done by state institutions so that we fulfill our part of the job on the path to the European Union. This document will be presented on July 1. I took part in the NATO summit this morning. This is a special summit. A summit of transformation. The Alliance is changing its strategy in response to Russia&#x27;s aggressive anti-European policies and Russia&#x27;s war against our country. It is obvious that it is impossible to guarantee security in Europe in such conditions without our state. And we will do everything to transform this obvious nature into concrete decisions - for Ukraine, for the Alliance. We need clear security guarantees - we will have them, and today I called on NATO members to find a format of decisions that would allow for Ukraine&#x27;s full participation in our common European security architecture. I called on NATO countries to speed up the supply of missile defense systems to Ukraine and significantly increase the pressure on the terrorist state. Today&#x27;s Russian strike alone at the city of Mykolaiv - 10 missiles at once, and all of them were aimed at civilian targets - proves for absolutely everyone in the world that the pressure on Russia is not enough. One of these missiles, a hypersonic anti-ship missile &quot;Onyx&quot;, destroyed an ordinary five-story building. Dismantling of the debris continued over the day. As of now, five people are known to have been killed. There were also strikes at Ochakiv, Dnipro, the Russian shelling of the Kharkiv region, Sumy region, Donbas. Lysychansk, Avdiivka, communities in the Bakhmut direction - the situation there remains extremely brutal, very difficult. We are doing everything we can to provide our military with modern artillery systems to respond properly to the occupiers. Russia squeezed out the message of Syria about the alleged recognition of the occupation structures in Donbas as alleged states. This is an empty story. And in that case, there will be no more relations between Ukraine and Syria, and the pressure of sanctions against Syria will be even greater. For the first time in all the years of independence, the President of Indonesia, a very influential state that may suffer significantly from the food crisis provoked by Russia, paid a visit to Kyiv today. Therefore, these were important negotiations that opened for Ukraine another strategic direction of relations with Asia. One of the most famous businessmen in the world, Richard Branson, also visited Ukraine. He is more than just an entrepreneur. He is a visionary, a man who works for progress and the best technology for all mankind. His arrival in Ukraine right now - and he visited Hostomel, where he discussed, in particular, the possibility of rebuilding the airport and building our &quot;Mriya&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest aircraft - is a very strong signal to everyone in the world that Ukraine will definitely withstand this war. And I am grateful to Mr. Branson for his willingness to join the post-war reconstruction of our country. And another optimistic and very important news: 144 Ukrainian warriors were returned home from Russian captivity. 59 soldiers of the National Guard, 30 - Navy; 28 - army, 17 border guards, 9 territorial defense soldiers, 1 policeman. The oldest of the liberated is 65 years old, the youngest is 19. In particular, 95 Azovstal defenders return home. I am grateful to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and to everyone who worked for this result. But let’s talk about this later. We will do everything to bring every Ukrainian man and woman home. Thank you again. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Zmiinyi Island is a strategic point, its liberation significantly changes the situation in the Black Sea - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-06-30</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Undoubtedly, the main word today is Zmiinyi. Apparently, there was just as much talk about Zmiinyi only on the day when the Russian ship arrived there. Then the ship left - forever, and now the island is free again. I am grateful to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, the fighters of &quot;Alpha&quot;, I am grateful to our gunners, pilots of the army aviation and Air Force, the command of &quot;Oleksandriya&quot;. Zmiinyi Island is a strategic point, and it significantly changes the situation in the Black Sea. It does not guarantee safety yet, it does not yet guarantee that the enemy will not return. But it already limits the actions of the occupiers significantly. Step by step, we will drive them out of our sea, our land, and our sky. The situation in Donbas remains the toughest, extremely difficult. The fire superiority of the occupiers is still extremely tangible - they have already taken everything from their reserves to hit us: the Luhansk region, the Donetsk region. I am grateful to everyone who defends our positions in such conditions. This is true heroism. The United States announced today a new package of support for Ukraine, primarily concerning defense. I am grateful to President Biden for this assistance. Soon it will get to the frontline to work for Ukraine, for the defense of freedom. Talked about defense support with the Federal President of Germany. Thanked him for the help that had already been provided. Once again I outlined our priorities - the types of weapons we need. President Steinmeier expressed his condolences over the inhumane attack on Kremenchuk and our other cities. Today, another significant step in our rapprochement with the European Union took place - Ukraine launched a significant export of electricity to the territory of the EU, to Romania. And this is only the first stage. We are preparing to increase supply. At the expense of Ukrainian electricity, a significant part of the Russian gas consumed by Europeans can be replaced. That is, it is not just a question of export revenue for us, it is a question of security for the whole of Europe. I would like to remind you that our country joined the common energy system of the EU already after the start of the war. Ukraine is doing things that seemed impossible. France&#x27;s Presidency of the Council of the EU ends today. The historical period when we received the candidacy. Europe has become stronger over this time. The Presidency of the Czech Republic begins, and I am grateful to our Czech partners for the fact that they have identified the reconstruction of Ukraine as one of the priorities of their Presidency. It is really important to start reconstruction as soon as possible on the territory that has already been liberated. And our priority - and this will be a task for all representatives of the state - everything should be done as soon as possible to prepare the start of membership negotiations. Government officials, deputies, diplomats - everyone must work on this 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. By the way, tomorrow there will be news on this topic. Ukraine’s European integration cannot be stopped. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for our freedom, the freedom of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are obliged to win the war unleashed by Russia for the hopes of all nations for a peaceful future to be realized - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the 4Gamechangers festival in Vienna</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-01</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. Federal President, Dear Mr. Federal Chancellor, Dear moderators! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear attendees and all people who watch us in different countries of our wonderful world! Thank you for the invitation to participate in your forum. Gamechanging is really something that can be said about Ukraine, and it is quite logical that such a forum takes place with our participation. And I immediately want to draw your attention to one fact, very important, in my opinion. Over the years, there have been many different discussions about what our lives could become. People argued for a long time about what should be changed and what can be changed. But now, for the first time in many, many years or even decades, the changes speak for themselves. This is the fact. You don&#x27;t have to look for them anymore. No more discussions, no more arguments. Everyone can just see what needs to be done. Done immediately! Just look at what is happening. Look at how easily one state created a threat, a large-scale threat, a dangerous wave for many, many others. For example, the threat of large-scale famine. Russia blocked the Black Sea - it&#x27;s no secret, and it is now keeping millions of people hostage, ordinary people in Africa, Asia, Europe. We are all hostages. You are its hostages. Because if this threat of hunger is not removed, if the Black Sea is not unblocked immediately, the food crisis will result in such a migration tsunami that will reach even you, although Austria is pretty far from the sea. Look at how much one state has been able to do to spread dangerous conspiracy theories and aggressive propaganda. What kind of trust in mass media will we be able to talk about over time, if Russia continues to spend billions of dollars annually to spread lies, and these lies remain in the information space even of the European Union? Please take a look at the cyber attacks that Ukraine, Lithuania, and other countries have suffered. Russia supports cybercriminals whose only mission is to destroy security. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re all aware of how big corporations disregard people&#x27;s right to privacy and appropriate a lot of data about each individual. But... What can you oppose it with when the largest state in the world does this and even much worse? And just look at the prices of fuel, gas, etc. What is happening to them? Markets are too dependent on Russian companies, Gazprom and Russian oil suppliers. And therefore, the wallets of Europeans are too dependent on how much one state wants to extract from them. One state cannot break the lives of everyone in Europe or even in the whole world! This game needs to change! How many years have we been talking about the fact that Europe should not depend on Russian energy resources? And this year, it is necessary to do it in time so that the next winter does not become catastrophic. How many years have we been talking about the fact that Russia spends dollars and euros from oil and gas against the West itself, against the entire community of democratic countries? It is a sponsor of divisions and disinformation, anti-European political movements and problems for the entire continent. This flow of money used against the democratic world must stop this year. Otherwise, everyone in the world who hates democracy will understand that the democratic world cannot defend itself. And about the war. You know, war is said to be the continuation of politics by other means. If we talk about the Russian war against Ukraine, then it is really so. This is a continuation of Russia&#x27;s long-standing anti-European politics, and every Russian occupier on Ukrainian soil is aware of this. But did everyone truly realize this, everyone in Europe, in the European Union? Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukrainian gamechanging is in the fact that we give a chance to do what should have been done a long time ago. Strengthen European unity as much as possible. Eliminate Europe’s dependence on Russian energy resources. Maximize support for free mass media that work according to journalistic standards, so that there is something to protect the truth from propaganda, and therefore from lies, conspiracy theories and anti-scientific theories. Create effective common European tools for protection against cyber threats. And of course it is vitally necessary to reinforce international law with a real punishment for its violation. The eyes of all aggressive political movements and regimes in the world are now focused on what Russia is doing against us, against Ukraine. They are waiting to see whether Russian officials and military commanders will pay for what they are doing on the territory of Ukraine. Whether the world will be able to bring war criminals to real justice. If the answer is positive, it will be a strong foundation for peace on earth in the future. If not, if hundreds of treaties and conventions violated by Russia remain mere pieces of paper, humanity will have to deal with hundreds of other aggressions. Ukraine gives this chance to take the necessary steps. Ukraine gives time in order to take these steps in time. We are obliged to win the war unleashed by Russia for the hopes of all normal people for a peaceful progressive future to be realized. Is it possible without the help of Austria? I don’t think so. I am grateful to your state for the support. Is our joint victory possible without powerful sanctions, which should be strengthened regularly so that the terrorist state does not have time to adapt to them? No. And I ask you to redouble your activity in the preparation of these sanctions, in the preparation of the seventh package of European Union sanctions. Only at this time, only in these months, only this year the necessary steps can be taken. Either the game will change in favor of Europe, or the enemies of democracy and freedom will believe that the game can change in their favor. We have to do it in time! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>European integration of Ukraine is a guarantee of a free and prosperous life for all generations of our people - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-01</span></div>
  <p>Dear Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, Dear Prime Minister, Dear people&#x27;s deputies, Ladies and Gentlemen! A new history of Ukraine and the European Union has begun. We are now not next to each other, but together. Not two neighbors between which there are borders and barriers, but one European family that has common values and a common destiny. And it&#x27;s not just words, it&#x27;s not declarative, it&#x27;s not some kind of hope or political calculation, it&#x27;s a legally fixed status. Ukraine has gained the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. 115 days between the submission of the Ukrainian application for accession and the response of the European Union is a record short period. We were united just as for our defense. We acted in unity just as for the protection of our state, our land. We did not stop for a moment until the European Council adopted a positive decision, just as we will not stop for a moment until we win. We are aware that the European integration of Ukraine is a guarantee to all generations of our people of a free and prosperous life based on the best human values. And that is why it is an honor and a great responsibility for each and every one of us to participate in the realization of the European aspirations of our state. What is 115 days? These are hundreds of negotiations: meetings, phone conversations, hundreds of events, rallies, concerts in support of Ukraine and our candidacy, hundreds of decisions adopted. These are hundreds of updated procedures and thousands of pages of a perfectly filled questionnaire that we received from the European Commission. All this was not easy, but we did it. Congratulations to you! We have created an extremely strong foundation that no one can destroy and on which we can make our European future our present. Ukraine is fighting for its choice of values: to be an independent state in a large family, in a free family, a new state in a European family. Ukrainians have to defend their independence with weapons in hands. The safety of each of our people. To prevent such tragic Ukrainian mornings as today&#x27;s - with a Russian missile attack on Odesa and the region, with numerous victims. And to make Ukrainian mornings as peaceful as the mornings of every European capital - now, in the XXI century. And I really want all civil servants today to perceive their duty to work for the sake of the European choice as a struggle for our state, a struggle for Ukraine, for ourselves. We have to prepare the state for the start of negotiations on membership as intensively and as responsibly as we prepared the decision on candidacy. Today, the flag of the European Union will appear in this hall. And it should not just be a beautiful gesture. Not just a symbol. This should be a symbol of our task - the task of all of us, of all branches of government. So that there are no pauses in our work. So that every decision necessary for Ukraine&#x27;s European path is adopted. And so that these are the decisions the positive effect of which will be felt by Ukrainian society, Ukrainian families and Ukrainian citizens. Gaining membership in the European Union is not only geopolitics or the realization of political aspirations. These are specific things, specific advantages that benefit the life of every person, every company, every state institution. Only recently, the transport visa-free regime and aviation visa-free regime have been implemented. We have got the most free access to the European market - without duties and quotas. We have joined the common European energy network and are now able to export electricity to the countries of the European Union. These are revolutionary decisions for our economy and our state. The next steps are the customs visa-free regime, digital visa-free regime - i.e. Ukraine’s accession to the Digital Europe Programme. We have to significantly speed up the work on the industrial visa-free regime. And of course, we have to achieve a decision on the abolition of roaming charges between Ukraine and the countries of the European Union on a permanent basis. The European path is just such decisions. Each of them strengthens our state, each of you. Together, they create new opportunities for the whole of Europe - thanks to the realization of Ukrainian potential. Europe is becoming stronger together with Ukraine! Many decisions will depend precisely on the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, on each of the deputies. On the extent to which you, dear people&#x27;s deputies, are ready to work for this path. And on the extent to which government officials will work in coordination with you and our diplomacy. The Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union is already 63% implemented, and 37% remain tasks for all of us, for our state. But you still have to elaborate, defend in front of your colleagues and pass dozens of important bills. It won&#x27;t be easy either. However, there is no alternative. Even if you know that you will not get applause with this or that decision, if the decision is necessary for this difficult, important European path of our country, you must adopt such decisions. Today, we are signing a joint statement, which is a signal of the unity of all branches of government and evidence of our determination to achieve the strategic goal of Ukraine, namely: full membership in the European Union. And signing this statement should mean the same as signing the application for entry - on the fifth day of the war. We have been going towards candidacy for 115 days. And our path to membership must not take years, decades. We have to cover this path quickly. To what extent it is possible is up to us. We have to do our part of the job ideally to enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly, in the same consolidated manner. Dear Mr. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada and Dear Mr. Prime Minister, Dear attendees, Today I want to thank every European nation and every leader who stood &quot;for&quot; the candidacy for our state. There have probably never been so many negotiations in such a short period of time. But all these negotiations were substantive, all of them were thought out, sometimes they were not easy. And I want to thank everyone present, our Cabinet of Ministers. Thank you. I am thankful to each and every one. It&#x27;s really hard work, which turned out to be successful in the end. And a great personal contribution to this success was made by great friends of Ukraine, who are and, I am sure, will be our great friends - President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. And today I have the honor to invite the President of the European Commission to deliver a speech in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Ursula, I wish to thank you once again for your leadership in building these powerful and strong historical relations between Ukraine and Europe, which have become our new history, the new common European history of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The United States announced a new support package for Ukraine, which includes powerful NASAMS systems that will significantly strengthen our air defense - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-01</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! In the Odesa region, the dismantling of rubble after the Russian missile attack on Serhiivka is underway. Three missiles hit an ordinary residential building, a nine-story building in which no one hid any weapons, military equipment or ammunition, as Russian propagandists and officials always tell about such strikes. It was a simple house, about 160 people. It was inhabited by ordinary people, civilians. The recreation center was also destroyed by this strike - an absolutely typical object for the seaside area. I emphasize: this is a deliberate, purposeful Russian terror, not some mistakes or an accidental missile strike. Four people from one family were killed... The murdered boy, 12 years old, whose name was Dmytro... As of now, there are 21 people on the list of the dead, and about 40 are wounded. The numbers have been changing all day, unfortunately, the death toll is increasing. Simultaneously with the missiles at Serhiivka, missiles were fired at Zatoka. 12 missiles hit Mykolaiv at once - various objects in the city. It&#x27;s only one night and morning... My condolences to all relatives, loved ones of all whose lives were taken by such strikes. I am especially grateful to the United States of America and personally to Biden for the new support package for Ukraine announced today, which includes very powerful NASAMS systems. An anti-aircraft missile complex that will significantly strengthen our air defense. We have worked hard for this supply. In total, this package is worth 820 million dollars and, in addition to NASAMS, also includes artillery munition and radars. We are no less actively negotiating about other new weapons from our partners - it is necessary for Donbas, the Kharkiv region, the south of Ukraine. We are doing everything to break the advantage of the occupiers. The Prime Minister of Norway visited Kyiv today. We discussed the further defense support for Ukraine, the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Norway has already given us significant support, but there will be an additional package of 1 billion euros. Thank you so much. We will not forget. A special Group on International Security Guarantees for Ukraine was formed. The Group is headed by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, ex-Secretary General of NATO (he arrived in Kyiv today). Head of my Office Andriy Yermak will also work with him. The Group included influential figures from various democratic countries of the world - Australia, USA, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany, Poland, France, Italy and, of course, Ukraine. The main task of the Group is to develop a format of security guarantees for our country, which will really work and work long-term, so that there are no future aggressions. We are increasing Ukraine&#x27;s foreign policy ties with Latin America. I held talks with the leaders of Argentina and Chile. Ukraine&#x27;s interests will be represented everywhere in the world. Despite the war, despite all threats, we do not stop our movement towards the European Union. Today in the Verkhovna Rada, I signed a statement on European integration together with the Chairman and our Prime Minister. We have specified with this document that we are starting to move from candidate status to full membership. I am grateful to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen who expressed clear support for Ukraine in her address to the Verkhovna Rada today. We will not waste time. I believe that Ukraine will be able to gain membership as energetically as we gained candidacy. I am grateful to everyone who helps our country today, I am grateful to everyone who defends our country. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In Lugano, Ukraine will present a national view of reconstruction; it is necessary to create a new basis for our life - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-02</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We are actively preparing for the start of a special conference in Lugano, Switzerland. Its first day is on Monday. A large-scale international event dedicated to the reconstruction of our country. Reconstruction in the broad sense of the word. It is necessary not only to restore everything that the occupiers destroyed, but also to create a new basis for our life, for Ukraine - safe, modern, convenient, barrier-free. This requires colossal investments - billions, new technologies, best practices, new institutions and, of course, reforms. And already on Monday, Ukraine will present in Lugano a national view on how to implement all this. In fact, this is the largest economic project of our time in Europe and extraordinary opportunities for every state, for every company that we will invite to work in Ukraine to prove themselves. The territory of 10 regions was affected by hostilities after February 24. During this time, we managed to liberate 1,027 cities and towns, and another 2,610 are still under Russian occupation. And most of them need to be reconstructed, hundreds of them were completely destroyed by the Russian army, they actually have to be rebuilt from scratch. But besides that, dozens of cities in other regions of Ukraine were hit by missiles. Hundreds of enterprises were destroyed. Among them there are also complex, very dangerous industries - chemistry, metallurgy... Of course, we have already begun to restore normal life in liberated communities and territories on our own. But implementing such a large-scale project across the country, providing new safety standards and a new quality of life is possible only by attracting international capabilities. Therefore, the Conference in Lugano can become an important step for the reconstruction of Ukraine. And when we implement this project - and I am sure that it will happen - this event might be considered its beginning. Although a lot still needs to be done for our victory - and it is a difficult path, because the war continues - but already now we must do everything possible so that the aggressor loses not only on the battlefield, but also historically, conceptually... So that everyone in Russia remembers that Ukraine cannot be broken by anything, by anyone, even by a brutal war. Today, the Russian army continued to fire missiles at our cities. As of the evening alone, there have already been six missile strikes, a total of 12 missiles. Mykolaiv, the Donetsk region... The airstrikes continued. Fierce hostilities continue along the entire frontline, in Donbas - the epicenter is, of course, in the cities of the Luhansk region. The enemy’s activity in the Kharkiv region is intensifying. We managed to oust the occupiers from Ivanivka, Kherson region, we continue to put pressure in the south of our country... In many cities in the rear there is a feeling of relaxation now, but the war is not over - it goes on. Unfortunately, its cruelty is increasing in some places, and it cannot be forgotten. Therefore, help the army, help volunteers, help everyone who was left alone at this time. And constantly use all your contacts abroad, all your information opportunities - even just social networks to spread the truth about the war and about the crimes of the occupiers on our land. Tomorrow and during the week there will be important negotiations and meetings for Ukraine - we do not reduce diplomatic activity for a single day. We also expect new decisions from partners regarding defense assistance to our state... The main thing, no matter how difficult it is for us today, we must remember that there will be tomorrow. And tomorrow should bring maximum benefit to Ukraine - everyone should do absolutely everything possible for this. I am thankful to all our defenders! You are doing great! You are strong! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine does not give anything up; we will return thanks to tactics and increasing the supply of modern weapons - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-03</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, two important professional holidays are celebrated in our country: the Day of the Naval Forces of Ukraine and the Day of Anti-Aircraft Missile Troops. I sincerely congratulate all defenders of Ukraine who serve in these troops, I congratulate all veterans of the fleet, all veterans of anti-aircraft missile troops. Thanks to your service and your bravery, thousands of lives of our people have been saved. The Russian occupiers suffered very significant losses both at sea and in the sky. They have not had such losses for many decades. Thanks again for your service! The main task of the state is to do everything for our heroes, our warriors from all branches of the army to have everything necessary for the defense of the state, to have the most modern weapons. It is not easy, it takes a lot of effort, it requires many negotiations, but we will ensure such a supply. Ukraine will reach the level when the fire superiority of the occupiers will be nullified. We are not losing a single day - we convince our partners, establish new connections, use all opportunities - political, diplomatic, information... Today, the Russian army once again brutally shelled Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, Kharkiv with MLRS and &quot;Smerch&quot; systems. In Slovyansk alone, six people are on the list of dead, and about twenty are wounded. A girl died, her name was Yeva. She would have turned 10 in August this year... Russia has enough Smerch, Uragan and Grad systems to destroy city after city in Ukraine. They have now accumulated their largest firepower in Donbas. And they can use tens of thousands of artillery shells every day on one section of the front. This is reality. That is why we destroy the potential of the occupiers - day after day, calculatedly, powerfully. And, of course, the HIMARS systems we received and other weapons from partners play an important role in this. The fact that we protect the lives of our soldiers, our people, plays an equally important role. We will rebuild the walls, we will regain the land, but people must be saved above all else. And if the command of our army withdraws people from certain points of the front where the enemy has the greatest fire superiority, in particular this applies to Lysychansk, it means only one thing: we will return thanks to our tactics, thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons. Ukraine does not give anything up. And when someone over there in Moscow reports something about the Luhansk region - let them remember their reports and promises before February 24, in the first days of this invasion, in the spring and now. Let them really evaluate what they got over this time and how much they paid for it. Because their current reports will turn into dust just as the previous ones. We are gradually moving forward - in the Kharkiv region, in the Kherson region and at sea: Zmiinyi is a good example of this. There will be a day when we will say the same about Donbas. The Prime Minister of Australia visited Kyiv today. A historical moment. And this is a very important visit. Australia is one of the top countries in terms of its level of support. We have already received significant defense assistance from it. Today, Mr. Prime Minister announced a new support package. I am grateful to him for that. Australia will also increase sanctions against Russia. This is the result of our constant activity, which increases the cost of this war for Russia. The Russian economy found itself in the biggest crisis in the last 50 years. The world severs ties with Russia. The words &quot;collapse&quot;, &quot;deficit&quot; and &quot;poverty&quot; will be the description of Russian life as long as this state wants to be a terrorist state. They lost more than 35 thousand soldiers, and this is a conservative estimate. What is all this for? For the sake of insane propagandists to be able to show a Russian or Soviet flag on the ruins somewhere in their broadcasts... There is simply no other answer. It is clear to everyone in the world – and, I am sure, to all the sane people in Russia itself – that Ukraine will win. It&#x27;s only a matter of time. It is a matter, unfortunately, of the losses we suffer, primarily of people. It is a matter of modern weapons, which we must get and will definitely get. Tomorrow there will be a conference in Switzerland dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine. Today in Kyiv, I met with the President of the International Olympic Committee, and one of his initiatives is the convening of a special conference to raise funds for the restoration of Ukrainian sports infrastructure... These and many other international initiatives simply would not exist if the world doubted our victory. Therefore, we must continue focused work, fight and beat the occupiers until we regain our entire country. Ukraine will be free. I am grateful to everyone who defends the state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia has chosen the path of war, Ukraine is fighting on the path to peace - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address to the Japanese university community</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-04</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear attendees! For more than four months, you’ve seen, heard and read the news with the headlines &quot;war in Ukraine&quot;. Over time, such an &quot;abbreviation&quot; may distort the global picture of events and the essence of things, everyone&#x27;s perception of what is happening in Ukraine, it can replace the truth. This is a war in Ukraine, which the Russian Federation started, which the Russian Federation continues, and which the Russian Federation does not want to stop. Ukraine is defending its own land, its sovereignty, its territory. Ukraine is fighting for peace. This is a cruel paradox of the XXI century, and for us these are realities. We cannot lay down our weapons, because otherwise we will disappear. As a state, as a nation, simply as people. Russia has chosen the path of war, Ukraine is fighting on the path to peace. Russia is shooting for destruction, Ukraine is shooting for survival. War is a national idea of the Russian Federation. The national idea of Ukraine is peace. And today I want to talk to you exactly about that, exactly about peace, not about war. For you - Japanese youth - war is something from books, movies, computer games. It is normal for you that Japanese soldiers do not die defending their own land, do not kill and do not encroach on foreign lands. Look around. What seems so ordinary and familiar to you is actually a huge blessing. The sky without missiles and bombs, houses and buildings - not destroyed and not damaged, loved ones and simply all your fellow citizens - not injured and alive. All this is a great blessing. And even more. All this is a &quot;miracle&quot; for us today. With weapons in our hands, we defend ourselves so that this miracle becomes a reality for us again. So simple and natural for human civilization. A normal state of affairs for a normal society and a normal country. It is not something incredible, fantastic or supernatural. It&#x27;s just peace. And this is exactly what Ukraine is defending today. This is precisely the reason for the struggle and the goal of victory for us. Peace. For the sake of the future. To this end, we should all find answers to a number of questions. What will our world be like? Will the rule of force or the rule of law dominate it? A world in which freedom, justice, human rights are the highest values? Or a world in which these values don&#x27;t matter? What will be the future of the UN and other international organizations - will they remain bureaucratized institutions with a closed &quot;club of the chosen ones&quot; like the Security Council unable to bring the aggressor to justice? Or will they be reformatted into functional institutions capable of preventing wars, famine, and effectively combating climate change? And finally, what should be the world&#x27;s response to the threats of dictators with a &quot;nuclear stick&quot;? How should we rebuild cities from scratch so that they become new-conceptual in terms of simplicity, environmental friendliness and energy efficiency? Can we use the Japanese experience of railway networks? How to get rid of energy dependence? What can we do for global food security? How to build a safe cyberspace? What new technologies should be put into service for our citizens? How to make people&#x27;s lives more comfortable? Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear professors, dear students! The main goal of Ukraine is peace. Peace that is ordinary to you. Which was ordinary for us too, but everything changed in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and started hostilities in the east of Ukraine. And on February 24, 2022, when, in addition to the east, the aggression of the Russian Federation spread to the south, north, center and west, when a full-scale war covered all of Ukraine like a tsunami. Peace. What was the norm has become a memory. What is normal and remains the present for you. And what, I believe, will be the future for us all. Appreciate peace! Cherish the main benefit that gives you all other benefits: the opportunity to study, develop, create and live! Cherish peace, defend peace, do not betray peace. You are capable of many things for the establishment and rule of peace. There is only one time when we can all serve peace in the whole world. And this time is now! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The reconstruction of Ukraine will be the greatest contribution to the maintenance of global peace - President&#x27;s speech at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-04</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President Cassis! Dear Mrs. President von der Leyen! Dear Mr. Prime Minister Fiala! Dear participants of the Conference! Ladies and Gentlemen! First of all, I wish to thank Mr. President of Switzerland, his team and everyone involved in the organization of our Conference. It is this Conference and its decisions that can become the first stride towards the historic victory of the democratic world. Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine is not just an attempt to seize our land and destroy our state institutions, break our independence. This is a much broader confrontation - the one in terms of the worldview. The anti-democratic and anti-European system built in Russia is trying to prove that it is supposedly stronger than all of us – Ukraine, Europe and the democratic world. It is trying to prove that Europe is allegedly weak and allegedly unable to defend its values. Such a worldview motive can be traced in all the actions of the Russian state - both in relation to Ukraine and in relation to all of you. And all the crises created by Russia - inflationary, food, energy, migrant, the contours of which are already present - are the worldview, ideological challenge. However, its most brutal manifestation is Russia&#x27;s aggression against our state, against us, the first ones it wants to return to its control zone in Europe. Look at what Russia is doing, destroying Ukraine. Russia is destroying the space of everything that matters to us and to any free human life. In four months of the full-scale invasion, 2,102 educational facilities in Ukraine were destroyed. These are schools, these are universities, these are kindergartens... When the Russian army uses artillery against a kindergarten or drops bombs on a school, it destroys not just walls and not just buildings. This is the deliberate destruction of the educational space - the space in which children are socialized, in which people learn to be people. All our societies have just recovered from the COVID pandemic, when for a long time only distance education was possible. Just when everything has started to recover, just when children have found themselves in the usual space of communication, the space of friends, education... Russia came and with its strikes is trying to say that we will not have this space - our education - at all. Why is Russia shelling hospitals? How can they give an order for an airstrike on a hospital or a maternity hospital? This is Russia&#x27;s manifestation that it is allegedly able to destroy the very possibility of civilization for Ukraine - the basic humanity that exists in every normal country. Russia shows that Ukrainians will not be able to even treat, even give birth to children. 799 medical infrastructure facilities have been destroyed from February 24 to the end of June. In what other country, in what other war were so many medical facilities destroyed in such a short period of time? All this is a deliberate tactic of Russia, not just shelling, but a bet precisely on ideological confrontation. The terrorist state hopes that such destruction will prove the alleged inability of the democratic system and the European choice of our nation to give people not even normal life, but life in general. Look at the systematic destruction by the Russian army of the residential neighborhoods of our cities and the constant missile terror. Why do they do it? This is not a purely military tactic... Each person has a space of home - and it is not only a separate apartment or house, it is a part of the city or the countryside where a person communicates, works, meets with friends, loves, raises children, visits parents. That is why the Russian occupiers fire at residential buildings with tanks or carry out artillery shelling of city blocks, that is why they target missiles on houses to destroy this entire space of life - to kill people&#x27;s feeling of home. More than 12 million Ukrainians were forced to become refugees because of this war. And how many of them will still return home, even if they have a place exactly where they lived before to return to? After such a brutal war and such barbaric Russian attacks, it will be very difficult for many people to find that feeling again - the feeling of a real home. Russia&#x27;s aggression still continues, and about eighty thousand objects have already been destroyed. These are tens of millions of square meters of space... And when we see such losses, we must see not just broken walls and not just broken bricks, not just burned corridors or rooms, but millions - millions of human destinies that will never be the same they were before. We must see dreams that no longer exist. Love that became impossible. We must see children who could have lived the same lives as each and every one of you, but now their lives are ruined. Russia not only deprived many Ukrainian children of their home or friends, but also made them orphans, killed their brothers and sisters... Russia&#x27;s intention is to make such ruins and such losses an alleged &quot;vision&quot; of democracy and Europe. With this aggression, Russia wants to prove that it supposedly has not just territory under its control, but life as such, and that it can supposedly decide for everyone whether they will have life at all. Therefore, this war is not just ours, not just a local one somewhere in the east of Europe. No. This is Russia&#x27;s attack on everything that is of value to you and me. Therefore, the reconstruction of Ukraine is not a local project, not a project of one nation, but a joint task of the entire democratic world - of all countries, certainly all countries that can say about themselves - we are civilized. Rebuilding Ukraine means restoring the principles of life, restoring the space of life, restoring what makes people people. Of course, this means construction, large-scale construction. Of course, this means large funding and colossal investments. Of course, this means a completely new level of security throughout our country, which has to continue to live next to Russia. But it also means a new technological level. It also means an opportunity for our countries, our companies, our specialists to show why freedom is more powerful than any tyranny. Back in the spring, we started offering our partners to join the project of rebuilding Ukraine. Even then, it was obvious that this would be the biggest project of our time – economic, technological, social, and most importantly, worldview. And I am grateful to the countries that have positively accepted our proposals to take patronage over regions, cities or industries affected by the war. In particular, I am grateful to Denmark for its willingness to become a chief in the reconstruction of our city of Mykolaiv. I am grateful to Britain for its interest in the reconstruction of the Kyiv region. And in the same way, I invite all countries of the civilized world, ambitious companies and specialists to join our efforts. In addition to everything else, it will allow us to create millions of new connections in the democratic world, in Europe, between our countries. Every city, every community, every industry that will be rebuilt will have a historical record of who helped it. Just imagine - these are not just flags of the partner country at the entrance to the city, but being woven into the new fabric of life in Ukraine, traditions and heritage of all those who worked on reconstruction. And, of course, I am grateful to the European Commission for the initiative to create a special European platform for the reconstruction of Ukraine. However, all initiatives, plans, ambitions should be in a single system, in which not only the needs, but also the feelings of Ukrainians will be in the first place. Therefore, Ukraine offers its national Reconstruction Plan, on the basis of which it will be possible to implement every initiative, every idea, as well as to use the funds that will be directed to reconstruction in a completely rational way and precisely in the interests of Ukraine. And among the key principles, I would note the following - maximum security; maximum technologies; maximum compliance with environmental standards; maximum use of &quot;green&quot; technologies; maximum implementation of barrier-free principles; maximum focus on community interests; maximum transparency - in planning, use of funds, selection of projects; as well as maximum rooting of the reconstruction project in the real economic life of Ukraine in order to realize all this and for the results of the reconstruction to work long-term, which means the creation of jobs and new industries in Ukraine, the localization of your business, your business processes in Ukraine. Of course, it is not only about restoring the substance of life, but also about institutional development. Our country has become a candidate for joining the European Union. The movement towards full membership involves reforms. But the reconstruction of Ukraine also requires reforms. We still have to strengthen our institutions, we still have to update living standards. Our goal is for Ukraine to become not only the freest country in Europe and the most convenient for life and business, but also for us to complete the political part of the work the fastest of all those who moved towards the European Union. We can do it - just as we have already done the biggest reform for the countries of the European community. And this, I believe, is the most important reform and we have already implemented it. The reform of the strength of the European Union is actually the reform of the EU. The European Union is truly united - firmly united now thanks to us, thanks to Ukraine. Thanks to this reform of ours, we have actualized each of the basic values of Europe. In the same way, the support of NATO states for our country means that we have united the Alliance as much as possible. The Alliance has not been so united for decades. And the reconstruction of Ukraine will be an equally great reform for all of us, because we will unite the democratic world to the extent that everyone will see: the worldview of free people always wins. The world will see that no one can ever achieve their goals through war. But now I want to make one important local emphasis. We need to act now. We have already liberated a significant territory of Ukraine - more than a thousand settlements. Challenges remain for a significant territory - economic, energy, social. Restoring school education, providing medicine for people, providing housing for displaced people, guaranteeing jobs for Ukrainians, protecting the energy industry - these are all important tasks right now, and especially on the eve of winter. Therefore, Ukraine presents two levels of action: strategic - and this means the recovery of the entire country, as well as tactical. We need this tactical help. This means the need to quickly restore everything that can be restored. Ladies and Gentlemen! As long as the ruins remain, so does the war. As long as the aggressor can hope to destroy the very foundation of life, there will be no lasting peace. That is why the reconstruction of Ukraine will be the greatest possible contribution to maintaining global peace. We can prove that the democratic world is stronger, Europe is more powerful, that our values cannot be destroyed. And we will definitely do it. Thank you very much for your attention! I invite you all to our beautiful country, the best in the world, to Ukraine, to work with us. Glory to Ukraine!</p>
