        <p>And I'm Mike Hough. We're both owners and coaches of the Leadership Ignition team. And we are so excited to launch this show where we're gonna invite you to get lit one F-bomb at a time.</p>

        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>Love it, I love it. So let's start with who we are. At Leadership Ignition, our mission is about fostering growth as leaders, not just at work, but at home, in your health, in your finances, and in your faith. All important aspects. We do that through personal team coaching events, this podcast, and virtual personal and physical coaching and nutrition guidance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>Yeah, that's right. We've been coaching leaders and entrepreneurs, helping them discover clarity of purpose, building more fulfilling relationships, enhancing their spiritual life, optimizing their health, but fundamentally just live with greater impact in every area and we are uniquely qualified to do it. Shane, tell our listeners about your background.</p>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>So we'll keep it surface level today for this first podcast, don't wanna get too deep in the weeds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>But we will get deep in the weeds in future episodes, I promise you that.</p>
