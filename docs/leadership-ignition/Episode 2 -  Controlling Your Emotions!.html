    <div class="description">        <p>In this episode of the Leadership Ignition podcast, Shane Beckham and Mike Hough discuss the importance of controlling emotions in various aspects of life. They introduce the concept of emotional zones—green, red, and blue—and explore how mastering the green zone can lead to better decision-making and leadership. The conversation delves into practical strategies for navigating emotional challenges, including recognizing triggers, the significance of discipline, and the impact of emotions on personal and professional relationships. The hosts emphasize the need for self-awareness and intentionality in managing emotions to foster a positive environment for oneself and others.</p>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>Welcome back everyone to the second episode of the Leadership Ignition podcast. Again, brought to you by the Leadership Ignition team where faith, family, fitness, and finance unite to help you level up your life. I'm Shane Beckham. And I'm Mike Huff.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>We're both owners and coaches with the Leadership Ignition team, and we are ready to get lit one F-bomb at a time. Shane, you want to introduce the topic this week?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>I do. So this week, again, you know, we cut the stage last episode talking a little bit about what we were going to get into, and this week's episode is about controlling your emotions and how important that is for not just your work, but your family, your influences outside. You could even be at the grocery store. Like, we see all these things where people's letting emotions kind of get away from them in today's society. So we want to talk a little bit about how we handle our red zones, our green zones, and our blue zones. And when you break that down, Mike, I personally feel like if you, you know, you can master the green zone. Like if you can become a master of that green zone, which is we're going to call that the safe zone. That is the goal state of what we want to be in. If we're talking about red and then you got the blue zone, which is another little anomaly, but if we can master it and stay in that goal state, that sir, is where the discipline of life lives. When you are in that green zone, you are impacting yourself, the others around you, your family, your friends, your colleagues, you're reacting rationally. You're behaving normal. You're you're in your end zone, right? You're fine. So you're making calm, clear, and logical decisions when you're in the green, which is where you want to effectively be when you're in a state of decision-making, which we'll get in a little bit deeper on down the road here, but, you know, that's, that's what we want to be. So, you know, I know I have mine, but, you know, before we talk a lot about getting into what we use to stay in the green, maybe you can kind of give me a little bit more insight on what you, how you feel about, you know, just the emotions themselves and staying in that green zone or what that green means to you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>Yeah man, I'm just gonna back up a second because one of the things I want to do is paint an outline of what this looks like if you're gonna imagine drawing it on a piece of paper, right? So imagine a green line that's right across the middle of that sheet of paper and above that, yeah, two inches higher is a red line parallel to that green line and two inches below that is a blue line parallel to that green line, two inches below the green line, right? So now you've got a red line, a green line, a blue line. The idea is how you stay in the green. You're not touching red. You're not going over red. You're not touching blue You're not going below blue and when you do how do you get back there as fast as possible? So, you know you said a word normal. What is normal? It's funny. I've always talked about this I've Had this casual title for a book in my head called in search of normal because you see crazy stuff go on all the time for people that I'm probably a stack of notes this big of things I've observed that I would consider not normal now a lot of people that just live in the blue consider that normal and a lot of people that just live in the red consider that normal. It's not normal. What's normal is being able to control your emotions, whether they be depressive or excited and trying to stay even-keeled and without emotion and not that you're not, you don't have emotions. You don't make decisions or you don't react emotionally to situations. You recognize your emotion, you control it and you behave normally. To me, that's what's saying in the green issue. So what,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>before I get into some of mine while you've got while you're on that point that was a great illustration of How you laid that out is is how do you stay in the green? That's really the topic of what we want to focus on with this conversation. So appreciate that but How do you? Collectively, you know Stay in the green. What is some some simple things? I know we may revisit this later in this episode But what's just a couple of quick things that you do to make sure that you're staying congruent to that</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>Well, I will admit that I'm probably blessed with a lower basal metabolic resting pulse in most people. That's part of it, is I just start kind of lower to begin with. And then the other thing is, is I constantly evaluate my job as a leader in all walks of life, at home, certainly at work, amongst my friends. We're always, by the way, we're all leaders. Leadership, another thing that we learned from Mac, we've got a lot of authors say the same thing. Leadership is simply nothing more than influence and how you exert that influence, positively or negatively. You're always leading somebody somewhere and I'm just cognizant. I've taught myself to be cognizant that I'm always in a leadership position and now you're always casting a shadow of some type or another and so for me as As I start to sense myself moving one way or the other I'm I make myself aware that what I do next matters to those Around me not just to me. It was just me crashing around the world wouldn't matter It's when I have ownership and responsibility for the people around me that I realize that action isn't going to help them see me as a leader and so I'll lose credibility. And once you lose that credibility, you're kind of useless, right? Most people don't want to follow you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>To that point, Mike, you know, you talk about the three things that most, you want most people to have about you that's on your team, even in your family. Know, like, and trust, right? Those are very intangible ingredients that you need to be successful in life. Not just at your job, just in life in general.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>And in some places you can even do without like. I mean, it's critically important for most things. But you first need people to know you You want them to like you because it makes it easier to gain their trust and that's kind of what you're saying But once you've gained trust man so hard to gain so easy to lose and that's very true</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>Be in the blue in the red great way great way to put that, you know I talk in the gym all the time about hey be somebody's lighthouse</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>Yeah, I love that phrase</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>You can't be a lighthouse if you're not in the green because I mean you can but you're gonna be the wrong lighthouse You know, there's all kinds of examples of people out there that are not living in the green that are lighthouses to others and that's dangerous You know when you fall into those traps and to me, you know Unfortunately, I can find myself teeter-tottering off that green more than I want to and to your point It only takes once I tell you know I'm trying to tell my kids or even people that I'm around once it's out of your mouth once those words exit your mouth You can never and say it</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>It doesn't matter how much you apologize.
Speaker 3
It lives in somebody's head for the rest of their lives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>And one sentence can derail somebody. I won't bring up a personal thing because I know it would embarrass them, but I have someone very close to me that was told something and it, it, it bothers them. Like they brought it up to me today and this happened years ago, one sentence. And I'm like, man, the power of words and the way they can affect us as humans is It's just, it's remarkable to me because you just, it just stays there. It's unsaid. So living in that green, staying congruent to who you want to be, be in that lighthouse for someone else. You know, some of the things that I do is, and I talk this, talk a lot about this to you and others is breathwork, you know, is finding that inner peace. And I never thought that I could correlate something like that to staying in the green.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>I would be sitting on a yoga mat breathing deeply.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>You know, it's just when I start feeling myself getting a little bit reckless or out of control, you take that good deep breath and it triggers that memory. Okay. This is, this is not where I need to be. But with that said, you know, what happens, Mike, to me is I'll be in the green, like me and you're having great and, and fortunately or unfortunately, I'm not sure which emotion or which word I would choose to say about my emotional state. I can go from the happiest green there is to volcano eruption red in about one second. And it is very impulsive, very aggressive, and very hard to control when you have that kind of impulse. Had it my whole life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>But I would say, Shane, I also see you successfully move out of that red back into the green just as quickly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>Well, there's... That's the flip side of that, I guess. Yeah, my wife says there's something wrong with me, which there probably is. I'm not medically diagnosed with anything, by the way, but there is probably something moderately wrong with me. I agree with that, but I want to be able to not go into the red as much.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>You know, I want to be able to, we call that red, you know, the explosive slash fight mode for that very reason. Right. It's, it's dangerous.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>And I, you know, I jumped from green to red so fast, you know, energy shift. I feel myself tense up. My breath goes shallow. all the things that I'm training myself not to do immediately starts to happen. Now I have two choices. It's explode and then I'm done or step away, take that deep breath, realize that I'm about to do something that I'm very much so going to regret and trying to stay out of that red. You know, there is times you need to move into the red to protect others that are are close to you, you may need to go there. But that's an anomaly. Those are rare situations. This is just everyday life when a colleague may come up and say something to you, a worker or somebody that works for you, and you just got to really-- OK, I can get through this. So how often do you see yourself moving from that green to the red? I know it's not a perfect science, but what's your typical revolution look like there?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>I get frustrated in particular at work, I'll use that as an example, when I see people who just aren't trying that hard or just they know better and they don't do it anyway, or people who treat other people poorly. Those things really, they'll get me. You know, in particular, right? So think about our team members, the vast majority of our team members are entry level, people who are trying to generate income to feed their families. And then we screw up somebody's payroll and it's like, "Ah, we'll get you next cycle." Like, "Are you kidding me? "No, you'll get them now." Right, those are the kinds of things that really get me in the red. And so that probably happens 10 times a week, more than it should. I'll tell you when I was younger, back when the testosterone was flowing, I was one of those guys that thought I was the smartest guy in the room, everyone else around me was a bunch of idiots, and I would let people know, man, I would just say it 'cause people would frustrate me. And a couple of phrases along the way, but one that I stick to the most is, you wanna be right or do you wanna be effective?
Speaker 3
- Love that. - Love that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>I use it all the time, I teach other people that phrase, and it means the world to me, because if you just wanna be right, you're gonna stay in the red. If you wanna be effective, that brings you to the green, because you're trying to solve a problem versus just prove yourself right. And one other thing you said that I think is critically important is sometimes you have to go in the red. Yeah, but it should be intentional. It should be conscious. It should not be because you've lost your control. Very good point.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>And we as a society now-- not everybody, vast majority of it-- say that's bad. That's masculinity. You know, that's not something that you need to be doing ever. Well, I totally disagree with that.
Speaker 3
I was brought up differently than that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>And you know, it's just like you said, there's a time. But there is an intentionality about that to where, you know, if you cross these boundaries with me or my family, there's going to be a consequence for you to pay. Now, I may eventually have to also pay for that consequence. But you know, there's going to be-- you know, I am the protector of my family. me as the man of that house, I should be able to protect every human that belongs to me. And you know what I mean in that context. Additionally, your coworkers, your colleagues, you know, you look at the world through that lens and say, I will protect these people all that I can. So being intentional in the red is completely different than losing your cool. That was an excellent point because again, our kids are not being taught that. - No, they're not. They are being taught that that is a bad behavior. What happens to kids like me that can never express that? Eventually something's going to give man. Yeah, I can tell you that much. I promise you something's going to give and it can lead down to some dark holes because you want to drown that out. And that's again, that's another episode. But I have to drown that noise out sometimes. Right. I used to think I had to. Well, how do you do that? You self-medicate. You drink. Drinking then what opens gateways of doors to further bad decisions, which eventually can take you into the red way farther than you would have ever gotten if you would have just thought things through. So excellent point on having to intentionally get there. I think that's a great, great point for people to understand that it has to be intentional. So one of the last points I'll make about going into the red is something that I've tried to do better is you have to train your awareness. Treat it like a rep in a gym. And if you train your awareness, you're gonna know what your threshold is. Meaning, I intentionally do not put myself in certain situations to where I know that it is a high chance I will go into the red. I've had to remove that from my life and I feel like that's sometimes what people are unwilling to do because the comfort zone can be toxic. They live at the red because that's all they know. They don't know how to get out of the red because they've lived in the damn red their whole lives. Perfect example. My second marriage, gasoline and fire, brother. We, we woke up in the red and went to bed in the red. And you talk about a miserable life for both of us. Everybody involved. It was just not good. And I don't condone any, you know, we'll try to work through your stuff, but when you live in that zone of emotion for so long, it becomes who you are. And I mean, when I got with Les, she's like, you're broken. You don't know how to function without somebody yelling at you. You don't know how to function without chaos, without getting angry. And she was exactly right. And you don't realize that when you're living in those zones, it's just normal to you. So being able to have somebody shake you out of that zone is almost as important to understanding and you start realizing where your thresholds are at. So just some side nuggets there of how that can shake down. Cause I've lived it. Not cool. Not cool.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>Well, I'll say one more thing about the red and then we should talk about the converse of that. But it's interesting watching, watching young people. I won't name the relation to my family, but the young person in my family, it's probably young people, a lot of people's families, that you take away a device for them not fulfilling a chore obligation or something else, right, and it's like, "Hey, give me that iPhone, "give me your iPad, you're gonna lose it for eight hours." For the first three hours, they are in the mega red. Everything's aggressive, everything's upsetting them, they're angry, right, and they were probably in the red to begin with, being sucked in that device. take it away and then suddenly by hour four, five, six, they come around, they want to play cards, you want to have a conversation. It's amazing to me what these devices are doing to our emotions as well. Red and blue. And we're going to talk about on the blue side as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>Now I completely agree with that. You're you you've that's a whole nother, whole nother world, dude. Whole nother world of issues and troubles and problems for sure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>You know, I would say the other thing, Shane, is, is, um, you know, we're thinking about our past coaching experiences and people that we've engaged with, you know, the vast majority of people who've gotten the most out of, I won't say that, not the most out of, who have really been hungry for what we're teaching are people who can't figure out how to get out of the red or the blue. And they're mired in it and they don't know what to do. And so we went back, going back to your first statement, which is discipline is what drives green. It's discipline to do the work that you got to do when you're there, discipline to recognize when you're in, when you're having a problem, discipline to know you need to change. Discipline to add in things in your life that make you healthy that regulate like like workouts and diets and nutrition. Discipline to own that that's your behavior affecting other people right? So I mean we're gonna talk more about that as we talk about bridging. It just struck me that as we talk about the people that we're trying to engage, when we instill the discipline to do the work, it tends to lessen the variability around grief.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>-Now I couldn't agree more. Like you just said, discipline is the pathway. Motivation will fade and when that motivation of change, usually when you start hitting that rock bottom, you realize I need to change. You have a motivator. What happens when you start crawling out of that valley a little bit? Do you have that same discipline? That's where we see people relapse. That's where we see people fall right back in that comfortable trap because when things start getting hard, you need a coach. You need someone to help you pull you up that mountain. You need someone to carry you part of the way and there's no shame in that because sometimes you can't get out of the The red or the area that you're at so completely agree with that</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>Well, but and i'll add people think once they're out once they're touching green I don't need I don't need a coach anymore. Is that right? You don't need to coach. We all need coaches as I said at the very beginning You don't have to to be sick to get better Think of one professional athlete pick one Any one of them that you know, that's famous to you Which one of those guys do not have two to five coaches? Absolutely. And to your point, pick a successful business entrepreneur. Absolutely right.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>You asked them, they all have coaches, every one of them. So that's a great point. Let's move into the last emotion that we want to talk about today, which is going to be our blue zone, right? This is the depressive withdrawn zone. Some other adjectives could be used for it. Now, me personally, this is a danger zone for me. I know that sounds silly because red's usually, you know, Considered to be dangerous, but I can go green to red and get right back out of the red When I like other many other humans fall into the blue The blue is like the ocean my friend and it will swallow you up if you let it it'll swallow you and then you're gonna Have all these other voices It's telling you all these things and it's just like all these bricks just keep coming down and you're like I can't get out of this hole It's a danger zone for me. It creates sadness. It brings a void in my life and that's when you want to cope How do I cope with this sadness? How do I cope with this the decisions that I've made it caused me to be sad Coping usually equates to addiction can You you lean in to stuff to temporarily make it go away Alcohol drugs force. I never had the second part, but I would drink to cope You know, it would it would make me feel better temporarily, but then the choices I would made when I would drink would compound You know, so, you know, what's some of the things before I can't talk about what I've done to kind of stay out of the blue You know, what does blue mean to you?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>You know for me. I don't Again, I'm unfortunate. I don't spend a lot of time there There's a period of time when the kids are really young. We were living in Seattle Seattle, right? It was rainy It was cold. We had just sold our first house We had a condo that we could house in Chicago. We had to leave that right away We moved into an apartment in cold rainy Seattle kids were little I was working a ton Didn't get enough time at home. Didn't really love my my my work environment and then I was living somewhere I didn't really love to live and so, you know, you combine all that it just got tough for about three months. That's it I have not had a lot of other environments. I've had a lot of bad things happen, but I am able to Departmentalized segment those to a bad thing that happened not a destruction of my life. I mean, I've we're very young We were not poor we were we were sub poor We were paying off payday loans when we could we were bouncing paychecks to Bouncing checks to buy groceries. We were I mean I drove a car that was broken on its frame I bought for 200 bucks because that's all we had I mean we we were poor but I was never never blue because I'm able to segment those things from what's happening to me versus who I am. And before you get into coping mechanisms, another point here. Our current news cycle, our political discourse, the complete splitting of our society between red and blue in a different way is not good. And it's adding to the blue factor here because people are internalizing this every day and are getting fed the same stuff every day through their media channels. And it's just making them more and more depressed. It's bad. It's bad. So my first coping mechanism I would recommend is Disconnect from everything that feels bad. That's step one. What else you got?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>Now I completely agree with that and to segue a little bit on to that is you know Your past your past doesn't define who you are. And again, that's that's gonna be a whole nother topic, but Your past can keep you in the blue. You feel like you're not good enough to come out of it I'm not good enough to overlook this. What are they gonna say about me? Well, at the end of the day, it doesn't define who you are. And anybody had anybody that can look you in the eyes and say they've not had mistakes and made mistakes and done things they're lying to you. It's, you know, the ability to, to cope and find the resources that you need to get out of any of these emotions, especially blue, because the blue will swallow you. So to me, I found. I refound purpose through discipline of fitness. That was the gateway for me. Like it is many others, you know,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>you know, to get an hour. I purposefully have a time that I leave from work every single day. You go in the morning before you, well, your gym is your work, but I go, I have a time that everybody knows I'm leaving the office and I'm gone for two hours and I will not answer calls or texts unless it's extremely urgent. And then I plug back in. But man, that two hours kind of in the middle of the day, it's not, it's, it's evening time, but it is kind of the middle of the day. Cause I'm working late into the night, most nights. Uh, that break is so healthy for me physically. Yes. mentally more so. It gives me a minute to just kind of reset, think about all the inputs and reprioritize. Didn't mean to cut you off, but I think...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>No, no, no. I think that's absolutely right. It's... Critically important. You know, one of the things is, is blue doesn't mean you're broken. It just means you need to reconnect. You need to find your purpose and let others help you push through that. Let's move into how we want to bridge these emotions together. Okay? So when you think about bridging the colors, what is, what does that mean? You know, emotions are signals, not stop signs. Correct. You are not doomed to whatever you're feeling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>That's how I love how you say that. You're not doomed to whatever you're feeling. We all feel stuff. I feel, I'm sitting here talking like I'm a robot. I'm not a robot. I feel a lot of stuff all the time. What do I do with that? Do I allow whatever my natural reaction to be take over? I do not. I purposefully intend to choose a response. And so that's, you know, you've talked about discipline all along the way. And discipline is in this case choosing a response that's appropriate for the situation versus just reacting emotionally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>You know and then to your point on that, you know, every reaction causes a ripple effect. Either good or bad. That's for sure. You can create good scenarios or you can create bad ones, but you are the puppet master of your decisions of how you want to control that emotion. Whether you're right or wrong, If you, uh, if you can find a way to stay in that green lane, man, you're winning. You have won. You may not feel like it because you were right and they were wrong and you didn't, you know, but you know what, at the end of the day, if you could just smile and, and let it be water off of Doug's back is, is that you want to say, but you're winning and that will help you maintain that green line. And it's hard to do, trust me. It's easy to, for those words to come out of my mouth. But, uh, you know, discipline is, is the key ingredient there. If you want to lead, lead your emotions first.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>No good leader is running around the red or the green. Think about all start, start here first. Think about your least favorite leaders that you've ever had in life. Shame. Think about the people that really you did not want to work for. They were either constantly red or constantly blue. I guarantee it. Think about your, the leaders that you love. You know, anything green.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>to your point there, if you was to ask anybody, you know, name your, your favorite boss and your worst boss. It's greener. Yeah. One was in the green one was in red. Constantly. Constantly. Completely agree with that. That is me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>They're not so fun either.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>So Mike, as we get closer to putting some bows on this, finishing touches on this episode, what's some practical takeaways that someone can do to just quickly jolt themselves when they feel themselves in and out of an emotion or just throughout the day, you know, ask themselves, you know, is there anything that you could say that you would</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>recommend for somebody to do? Yeah, man, yeah, first get that visual picture of what it means to have the red line, the green line, the blue line and figure out where you are on that scale right now. So what color am I right now? Whether you're in the middle of something or you're in the middle of the day and evaluate back where have I been throughout the day, right? And then ask yourself once you realize you're red or blue or no, I've stayed green all day. Well, how'd you do that? What triggered it? What triggered the red? What triggered the blue? And if you are currently in that red or blue state, just simple question. What do I need to do to get green? You know, we're going to talk about a lot of things throughout this, this podcast, but we're always going to say one thing, one, one little question. What gets me closer to the thing and what gets me further from the thing? That's really important to you. And that's all we're talking about.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>You know, to your point on that, what color am I now? Think back to my corporate world days. I probably should have asked myself before hitting reply all to some emails that I fired back Absolutely. That's the famous one that one that one gets You know so much so that I do now I will read every text and every email when I know that my emotions are high It's probably not the best time. You know me text. I delete now then that I used to would send
Speaker 3
All the time I'll read them and then I'll think about it</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>And if I think it's still probably one I want to send, but I'm not sure, I'll let it sit in my phone and I'll walk away for some time and I'll come back to it. Still, even at that point, nine out of 10 times, I will delete it or I will drastically change it. And I think I'm like, God, I'm glad I did not send that. So that could be an everyday practical use that you implement, even with your children.
Speaker 3
Yes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>You know, when you get frustrated or your, you know, your coworker, your colleague, think about what you're fixing to say. Where does that road lead you? Because if it only leads to further drama and toxicity, guess what? Now you're pulling people up into the red with you. Now you're causing chaos and carnage all around versus this line, or you could be so aggressive and mean and ugly. You cause someone that was here to go into the blue. So not only do you have impact to control your own emotions, what you do and what you say and how you behave will directly correlate with how you can present and</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>project onto other humans. Two totally different types of outcomes of influence. In all those scenarios you talked about, influence. You influence everything around you all the time. Choose what influence you want to have. Do you want to be right or do you want to be effective? So let's dig into some further</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>tools that can help us again. Just some high-level things that some of the things that we do that Mike and I talk about before, and we've talked a little bit about this podcast, or on the podcast, is one of the things I choose to do that really helps me is this guided breathwork. And what is that? How does that even work? Well, there's a lot of them out there. Mike and I, I know we both choose to use Wim Hof is one that's really popular. It's easy to use. It's easy to download. It gives you guided breathwork. It's great. Another one that I really love, Mike is just your overall movement. If you're starting to feel a certain way, get up and walk around, take a break, go for a walk, take a clarity break, right? Clarity is going to be one of our hot topics that we talk a lot about. Now, is there any more that you can think of off top of your head?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>Well, you know, I think set yourself up for success. Think about a solid morning routine that allows you to refocus on the things that occurred the day before, the things you're about to get into and make a promise to yourself about how you're going to control your reaction to those things today. Yeah, and then I think, look, anytime we help other people, be service to others, whether that be, you know, in your community, in your family, but just your friends. I mean, how often it's a service to somebody else if you reach out to them and tell them what they mean to you. Do that once a day. And Matt, you will be surprised. Probably not the same person every day. That gets a little old. But reach out to people that you know and tell them what they mean to you, because it will change your perspective on that little bit of gratitude, whether you're actually doing it, you're out in a community helping people or whatever, it creates a completely different feeling inside.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>You know, the gratitude text is something that we believe in. We'll talk more about that as we get into the 4F bombs. But to your point, taking an extra 30 seconds to send someone a boy shot and letting you know you're thinking about them and what they mean to you, man, you talk about making somebody's day. Just little things like that can take somebody that's in the blue or red state and bring them right back out of it. So I think those are great points.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>Although whenever I do that with you, you usually come back with something sarcastic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>This is very true, very true. But I do catch myself every now and then and I'll throw a little nugget back. Let's talk a little bit about how, what our mission is. You know, again, when it comes to things like clarity of your emotions, you know, we want to be able to help all kinds of people, leadership teams, non-leadership teams, teams that are under the leaders, like the second row and third row, frontline people, entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, anybody that's hungry to grow and learn. That is what we want to do with our leadership impact team is we want to impact those things. Mike, how some ways we want to do that?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-2">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 2</div>
        <p>Well, and I'll add some more groups. Think about church groups or wine clubs or anyone who's got a group of people that are trying to level themselves up. We want to be a part of that and help you do it. So we do that through coaching. Primarily we love in-person coaching. We've got a bunch of different ways that we do that. We've got you know, three different tiers, some that are half a day, one's a full day, one's a day and a half. Day and a half by the way, you get to do a workout with us, so that'd be a lot of fun. Dr. Justin Marchegiani: That's right. Evan Brand: And then, and man, you don't wanna do Shane's workouts, I'm telling you right now. We can do short-term speaking events. We're talking about potentially pulling together some retreats as we get through this. Absolutely subscribe to our podcast. We also do one-on-one coaching, physical fitness coaching, strength coaching, and nutrition coaching, so that's another way to engage with us. And look man, I love what Shane always says, "We don't do fluff." This is it, like we said, this is not just another podcast. We do fire, baby. So come and join us and let's get you lit. And Shane, how do you want to</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speaker speaker-1">
        <div class="speaker-label">Speaker 1</div>
        <p>wrap it up? No man, I was gonna say, you know, you nailed that ending there, you know, red, blue, green. Emotions aren't weakness, they're simply signals. And once you learn how to understand and master those signals, you're going to be a better version of yourself. You know, make sure strong leaders understand that. If everything else that helps you with your clarity and all those other things. So I was gonna say Mike, won't you tell everybody where they can find us and put a big old bow on top of this this episode. Leadership Ignition Team, that's</p>
