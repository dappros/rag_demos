  <h2>The longer the Russian aggression lasts, the more degradation it causes in Russia itself – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-25</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I have just completed a series of international conversations – with President of the United States Biden, with Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau, and with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Positive conversations that are very necessary right now for all of us. First. Of course, we discussed the hostilities on the frontline, our active actions. I thanked our partners for the support provided – it is very significant and really helps our soldiers move forward. Now the Russian occupiers are suffering losses, which we need. Each of their losses is a long-term strengthening of freedom. We also discussed further strengthening of Ukrainian troops, and I thank our partners for understanding our needs – long-range needs. I am especially grateful to President Biden and the United States for the reliability of Patriots. We discussed the strengthening of our artillery, MLRS and other things. Second. The situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Unfortunately, the world&#x27;s attention to the existing Russian threat at the Zaporizhzhia NPP is still insufficient. Just as the reaction to the Russian blowing up of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and the deliberate attempt by Russian terrorists to hit the dam of another reservoir in Kryvyi Rih was insufficient. I shared with our partners the information we have, the information from our intelligence, about the Russian scenario of mining the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which has obviously been approved for terrorists. We must take very specific steps – all together in the world – to prevent any radiation accidents. Third. The longer Russian aggression lasts, the more degradation it causes in Russia itself. One of the manifestations of this degradation is that Russian aggression is gradually returning to its home harbor. In our conversations with the leaders, we have exchanged our assessments of what is happening in Russia. We see the situation in the same way and know how to respond. And one more thing. Very important meetings took place today in Copenhagen. The format of political advisors. The Office&#x27;s team – Andriy Yermak, Andriy Sybiha, and Ihor Zhovkva – met with political advisors to the leaders of Türkiye, India, Japan, South Africa, and the European Union institutions. We are bringing the implementation of the Peace Formula closer, and for this purpose we involve the widest possible range of partners. Relations with the European Union remain a top priority, and every week we are laying the basis for full membership. With just 15 days to go until the NATO Summit in Vilnius, we are doing everything to ensure that the summit has real content. Strong content. Positive decisions for Ukraine in Vilnius are the only possible positive decisions for our common security in Europe and in the Alliance as a whole. Thank you to everyone who supports Ukraine! Thank you to Mr. President Biden, the Congress, both parties and all Americans for the historic strengthening of freedom in the world! Thank you to Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau and all Canadians for your unwavering support! Thank you to Mr. President Duda and everyone in Poland who stands with Ukraine in the defense of Europe! Glory to our warriors! Glory to every brigade that is now moving forward at the front... Tavria direction – you are doing a great job! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today, our warriors have advanced in all directions, and this is a happy day - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-26</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today - the front. Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia. Our warriors, our frontline positions, areas of active operations at the front. Today, our warriors have advanced in all directions, and this is a happy day. I wished the guys more days like this. I paid a visit to the Khortytsia units that distinguished themselves heroically in the Battle of Bakhmut. Well done, warriors! Then our marines - very powerful, very accurate. Thank you for doing your best to save the lives of our warriors. Then Tavria, the south, the front. It was a busy day, a lot of emotions... I was honored to award our warriors, to thank them personally, to shake their hands. Thank you for all your words of support, guys! Thank you for your hugs, very warm ones, to everyone today. And thank you for your chevrons - it is extremely honorable for me, and I will tell about each chevron separately. All our warriors - from soldiers to sailors to generals - are doing a great job! I presented two Gold Stars of the Hero of Ukraine – to Captain Oleh Olyva, commander of the airmobile company of the 81st separate airborne assault brigade, and Major Serhiy Dudin, deputy commander of the marine battalion of the 35th separate brigade. Indeed, they are great people, thank you! Meetings with generals... Zubanych, Tarnavskyi, Sodol, Syrskyi. Several operational decisions were made. Once again, we discussed the creation of the Marine Corps, all the details are clear, absolutely clear - organization, training, supply... We are strengthening the Marines and all elements of our Defense Forces, it is a must. Yesterday, I had talks with partners, including President Biden, primarily about arms supplies. Today, I was in the area where these weapons will give more power, more protection to Ukrainians&#x27; lives. And bring our victory closer, this is the main thing. All our land will be free - all of it. I thank everyone who is now fighting for Ukraine, who is preparing for combat, who is on combat missions, who is at combat posts... All those who are recovering from injuries... All those who are training our warriors! Thank you all! I am proud of all of you! Glory to you, our heroes! And eternal blessed memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine, each and every one of them! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every manifestation of terror proves to the whole world that Russia deserves only defeat and a tribunal - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-27</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Exactly on the anniversary of the Russian terrorists&#x27; attack on Kremenchuk, on the shopping mall, when 22 people were killed, Russian savages again fired missiles at the Kremenchuk district. Today, Russian terrorists also brutally shelled Kramatorsk. S-300 missiles. Three people were killed, including a child. My condolences to the families and friends. As of this hour, more than 40 people are wounded. Assistance is being provided to all. The rubble is being cleared. Each such manifestation of terror proves over and over again to us and to the whole world that Russia deserves only one thing as a result of everything it has done - defeat and a tribunal, fair and legal trials against all Russian murderers and terrorists. And I thank again and again everyone in the world who supports Ukraine and helps protect our people! Today we have a new defense package from the United States for our warriors. Armored vehicles and ammunition for Patriots, Stingers and HIMARS. Additional shells for our artillery. I thank Mr. President Biden, the Congress, both parties, and all Americans! I spoke with Mr. Prime Minister of Norway. I thanked him for the support provided - defense, economic, and political. It is very significant! I informed him about my trip yesterday to the frontline, to our warriors, about our current defense capabilities. I voiced some of our military needs. We also discussed the creation of a fighter jet coalition. A separate topic in the conversation was the upcoming NATO Summit in Vilnius. I am grateful to Norway for its understanding! Today, I also held a special meeting with our international experts - the Office and the government - to discuss preparations for the Vilnius Summit. I am confident that the decisions of the summit can be positive for Ukraine! We are doing everything possible for this and have engaged all of Ukraine&#x27;s international capabilities. And, of course, the frontline. Our heroes, our active actions. Today, we also have advancement! In all directions where we are conducting offensive operations. Thank you, warriors! Today we have important results in repelling Russian assaults. I am very grateful to you! Today, I would like to pay special tribute to the glorious 3rd separate assault brigade, the strong 28th separate mechanized brigade, the heroic 54th separate mechanized brigade and the tough 57th separate motorized infantry brigade. I thank all of you, warriors! Well done! Thank you for every occupier destroyed and every Ukrainian life saved! Glory to our heroes! Thank you to everyone in the world who is not afraid of Russian terrorists and is restoring security in the world together with us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The victorious Ukraine will be a country worthy of its heroes - President&#x27;s speech at the plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada on the occasion of the 27th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-28</span></div>
  <p>Glory to Ukraine! With these words – &quot;Glory to Ukraine&quot; – our brave heroes, courageous Ukrainians on the frontline look the enemy in the eye – with dignity, confidence, and perseverance. They defend lives for Ukraine. They give their lives for Ukraine. Thanks to these words, the whole world hears and knows that here in Europe, on the eastern flank of our continent, a global center of courage has emerged. A center that will never allow freedom to be destroyed - neither of our own, nor of our allies and partners. And it is an honor to say these words: &quot;Glory to Ukraine&quot;. It is an honor to be Ukrainian. It is an honor to gain glory for Ukraine. And it is an honor that obliges. It obliges us to win and build a victorious Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine! And we will do it! We will. All of us together! Each and every person who fights and works for our state, for our people. We will do it! Millions of Ukrainians – the modern generations of our people, whom history has blessed with the opportunity to realize the dreams of Ukrainian heroes of different times who fought for freedom and independence for Ukraine and for justice for all of us, for all Ukrainians. Everything depends on us now, and Ukraine will be a victorious state! Dear Ukrainian people! Everyone present in this hall of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine! The courage of our people has given Ukraine the moral leadership that inspires and unites the nations of the world. The Ukrainian aspiration to live freely and the heroism of our people have cleansed universal values from the age-old stain of cynicism and cowardice. Different nations have joined us in the fight for freedom, and not only because the world loves the brave. Whether the nations of the world will have peace and whether humanity will survive on earth depends on how we end this war and on whether the lives of the victorious Ukrainians will affirm freedom in the same way as the struggle for it. Just as we have already shown that courage gives freedom, we will prove that freedom gives success. We will make it a Ukrainian axiom: freedom gives success. This is what convinces the most. Success. This is what our entire land needs. Each and every one of us. All our people. All parts of Ukraine, all children of Ukraine. But for this success to happen, the Ukrainian state needs to be transformed. And we will make the transformation that Ukrainians have dreamed of a reality! I would like to quote the words of a Ukrainian soldier. His name is Maksym Nahornyi. He was born in 2004. He is an orphan. He serves Ukraine in the 14th Roman the Great mechanized brigade. Here are Maksym&#x27;s words: &quot;I witnessed terrible things that I want to forget, not to recall, to erase from my memory, just like yesterday of this damn war, but what will happen tomorrow? There is no need to rebuild the old system - let&#x27;s create a new and much better Ukraine!&quot; These words of Ukrainian soldier Nahornyi deserve our support. 27 years ago, the Constitution of our country was adopted in this hall of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. And I congratulate you today on the Constitution Day of Ukraine! Our beautiful Ukraine, which, despite everything, retains its free soul and is governed by its people, not by the arbitrariness of certain individuals. In 27 years, Ukraine has gone through two revolutions and preserved its democracy and Europeanness. 8 years of hybrid war in Donbas - and Ukraine has preserved its dignity and faith in the future. 490 days of full-scale Russian aggression. 490 days - and each of our soldiers, all our people believe in the Ukrainian future and already decide what they want this future to look like. As the Constitution lays the foundations, we need a Doctrine for our state. A clear, unambiguous, bold Doctrine. For Ukraine, which is on its way to victory. And for the victorious Ukraine. This Doctrine should answer all the fundamental questions about Ukraine and our future for ourselves, our neighbors, and everyone in the world. We need a new system, new rules, new opportunities. Unfortunately, for a very long time, state institutions in Ukraine and representatives of the state have treated our people and life in Ukraine in general with cruelty, disdain, and rapaciousness, to be honest. Like a bad stepmother or like an orphanage from which you want to escape. Unfortunately, behind the poverty, corruption, and injustice in Ukraine, the world did not notice our courage and freedom-loving spirit. When the world talked about Ukraine, it was more about the state institutions and facts of life in our country that needed to be corrected, not about heroes who deserved to be emulated. Even before this Russian-Ukrainian war, we embarked on a path of change. February 24, 2022 was Russia&#x27;s attempt not only to kill our independence and not only to erase our identity, but also to destroy our example - the example that a state of Ukraine&#x27;s size and complicated history can succeed in becoming a strong and prosperous democracy that convinces other nations in the region and the world to live freely, not in submission to anyone. In all its efforts, Russia will lose. And this is no longer a dream, it is a reality. Even now, despite the war, we continue to follow the path of change. And I am confident that the first day of peace after this war, the first day of our well-deserved victory, will also be the first day of further rapid transformation of Ukraine. The foundations of our life. Our institutions, economic practices, social habits, policies and everyday life. What we cannot change now, in the conditions of war, we will change in the process of our recovery and transformation. We will create a new and much stronger Ukraine! Dear Ukrainian people! We will determine together what victorious Ukraine should become. Just as we defend freedom and independence together. It will be fair. The Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that the President of Ukraine is the guarantor of state sovereignty, territorial integrity of Ukraine and observance of the Constitution of Ukraine, human and civil rights and freedoms. The President of Ukraine is the guarantor of our country&#x27;s strategic European and Euro-Atlantic course. In pursuance of these provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine, I would like to propose today for discussion, a nationwide discussion, the main guidelines for the future Ukrainian Doctrine. We need a common vision of what the victorious Ukraine should be like. We have the Day of Statehood up ahead, and then the Independence Day, and I think it is right to consider these days as stages for elaborating the points of the Ukrainian Doctrine. As a result of discussions here in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, in each of our communities, in the media, on educational, public and various business platforms in Ukraine, we will develop and then approve the text of the Ukrainian Doctrine at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. And very importantly... I would like to address our warriors, our Ukrainian heroes of this great generation. All Ukrainian soldiers and sailors, sergeants, foremen, officers, all generals... First, I ask everyone present in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to express gratitude to all our heroes with a minute of applause. Recently, I visited the positions of our troops in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. I talked to commanders and soldiers. I had the honor to present the awards - it is a great honor. I was honored to hug our warriors and exchange emotions and thoughts. Today, about a million of our people serve in the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine. In combat brigades and other units, hundreds of thousands of defenders are fighting for us, for Ukraine. And no one has the right to determine the fate of Ukraine without asking them, our heroes. We communicate with our warriors. We read them on social media. We see your aspirations, warriors! Everyone who was on the frontline saw that our warriors know what they are fighting for. And I ask each and every member of the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine - as far as the conditions of war allow - to take part in our national discussion on the Ukrainian Doctrine. Freedom is a child of care, and security is a brother of courage. The victorious Ukraine will be a country worthy of its heroes! Dear Ukrainians! Today, I propose five, in my opinion, main guidelines for discussion and the beginning of a nationwide debate on the Ukrainian Doctrine. These are directions that can be supplemented by certain specific points that the nation will consider important. So, here are five main guidelines for the Ukrainian Doctrine for discussion: The first is the philosophy of our victory. The second is the global nature of Ukrainian security. The third is the policy of heroes. The fourth is the policy of justice. The fifth is transformation in 10 years, namely a new foreign policy. A new economy. New relations between the state and society. Development of all our territories. Education and science. Culture. The level of security and freedom in Ukraine as a precondition and result of transformation. Let&#x27;s start with the main thing - our victory. When we talk about Ukraine&#x27;s victory in this war for freedom and independence, we say it specifically: Ukraine&#x27;s victory is the liberation of our entire territory from Russian occupation. We will not leave a single part of Ukraine to the enemy! Ukraine&#x27;s victory means the expulsion of all Russian military formations, mercenaries and militants from the entire territory of Ukraine. And it is the return to Ukraine of all our people who were captured by Russia or forcibly deported from Ukraine to Russian territory. Ukraine&#x27;s victory is the restoration of Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty within internationally recognized state borders without any restrictions on Ukraine&#x27;s sovereign rights. Ukraine will independently choose alliances for itself and its future - obviously in the European Union, obviously in NATO. We have to realize that the path to the main thing - to our victory - is difficult. And now no one can say when we will complete it. But there must be national consensus on how to define our victory. When the goal is clear and fair, it doesn&#x27;t matter how thorny the path to that goal is. Ukraine will walk this path to victory! And this is no longer a dream, it is a reality. Thanks to the successful defense against Russian colonialist and imperialist aggression, Ukraine is constantly increasing its moral capital, which is already the largest in the more than thousand-year history of Ukrainian statehood. Our leadership is already influencing the global balance of power. The future architecture of global, European and regional security is impossible without Ukraine&#x27;s participation. Ukraine must be and will be a co-creator, participant and guarantor of such security. Ukraine is already a defender and will be a guarantor of the rules-based international order. Thanks to Ukraine, the world has seen that rules are not just the spirit and letter of the UN Charter, international treaties and conventions, it is also the energy of nations willing to defend the spirit and letter of international law. The existing international institutions are not able to ensure the effectiveness of international law. But during this war, we have created, together with our allies and partners, defense, sanctions, financial, and humanitarian coalitions that fill the deficit of resolve that objectively exists at the global level. For example, the Ramstein format is the most effective - the interaction of more than fifty countries to support our defense with weapons. And one of our defense coalitions, the Patriot coalition, has provided clear evidence to the world that any missile or air terror can be overcome. I am grateful to our partners. The organization that we created and that works effectively in the interests of our state and Ukrainians is the United24 public charity platform. This format has allowed us to unite hundreds of thousands of people from more than a hundred countries to directly help our country and people without the mediation of international bureaucracy. The purchase of drones, humanitarian demining, reconstruction of houses and purchase of medical equipment... The main thing that United24 gives is the opportunity for anyone from anywhere in the world to join - people, businesses, non-governmental and humanitarian organizations. With two maritime export initiatives, Ukraine has demonstrated its influence on global food security. Russia has been blackmailing the world with hunger - we know it - and it must be punished for that. Together with its partners, Ukraine launched the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the Grain from Ukraine humanitarian initiative, which have helped restore global food security, price predictability, and guarantees of social stability to dozens of countries, primarily in Africa and Asia. 45 countries have received food through the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Its geography ranges from Spain to China, from Indonesia to Morocco, from India to Kenya. Let us applaud our farmers, our citizens - all of them. Another humanitarian initiative of ours, Grain from Ukraine, has united more than 30 countries that have joined us in helping to protect countries such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen, and others from famine. Ukraine, which went through the Holodomor genocide, is particularly sensitive to the fact that the Kremlin is trying to exacerbate the famine for other nations as well. If it wasn&#x27;t for Russia&#x27;s counteraction now, our maritime grain exports would be much higher. And it will be, because the world knows now that Ukraine is a globally important guarantor of food security for the whole world. Ukraine has proposed the Peace Formula, the only comprehensive and fair plan to overcome both the Russian aggression and all its consequences. The content of the points of the Peace Formula and the Formula itself are in line with the UN Charter and supported by the UN General Assembly. More than 25 international documents have declared support for the Peace Formula, including statements and declarations by the G7, the European Union, and the Council of Europe. We are uniting the world&#x27;s majority for the full implementation of the Peace Formula and are preparing a Global Peace Summit that will allow all nations of the world to show their leadership in the implementation of certain points of the Formula. But why is there a deficit of resolve that prompts us, together with our allies and partners, to look for ways to fill it? There are two reasons for this. Unfortunately, the aggressor is still present in the organizations that are supposed to protect against aggression. In particular, this is the UN, where Russia is still allowed to exert influence in certain structures and where Russia abuses the permanent seat of the Security Council and the veto, which it seized, by the way, in violation of the UN Charter. The second reason is that some states and leaders of the world still, unfortunately, look back to Russia when making their own decisions. This can be called an absurd and shameful self-limitation of sovereignty, because Ukrainians have proven that Russia should not be feared. Russia loses when it meets bold and confident resistance. The free world has all the weaponry, sanctions, political, economic and, most importantly, value-based advantages that allow it to build a complete defense against any Russian encroachment and blackmail. And this is no longer a dream, it is a reality. Together with our partners, we have already started building such a system of advantages. Dear attendees! Please let us thank everyone in the world who supports our country, our struggle for freedom! The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, Australia, all the G7 countries, all our partners, our friends, Poland, the Baltic states... most countries of the world... I thank you all! Thank you very much! The victorious Ukraine will use the moral force gained to modernize the existing international institutions. We see the interest of various leaders and nations, in particular, in reforming the UN Security Council. This should be done on a fair basis. We see that the coalitions and approaches we have developed to overcome Russian aggression and its consequences, having worked for Ukraine, are capable of ending other wars and removing dormant sources of destruction and death - the so-called &quot;frozen conflicts&quot; - from the face of the earth. Any frozen conflict is a war that will inevitably break out, and the only question is when and how many lives it will take. Therefore, peace must be fair. This is the kind of peace envisioned by the Ukrainian Peace Formula. And that is why the Ukrainian Peace Formula has universal benefit. Ukraine will never agree to any option of a &quot;frozen conflict&quot;, any! On the contrary, Ukraine will help all other nations of the world striving for a true, just peace with our Peace Formula. Ukraine has always relied and will continue to rely on alliances. Russia, on the other hand, views all its neighbors as slaves or enemies. Obviously, the world is and will be on our side. Obviously, Ukraine is strengthening and will continue to strengthen the partnerships and alliances in which it participates. And we have already historically strengthened the European Union and given the European unity such power that the European Union has never had. Every postulate for which the European Union was created is now working to the maximum throughout its existence. European values have never been as effective as they are now. The Ukrainian component is what the EU has been lacking. And it is no longer a dream, it is a reality. And we understand, and everyone there understands, that this is no longer a dream, it is a reality. Ukraine has gained the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. This year we have to launch a dialogue on full membership. Ukraine is ready for this. And we all have to consider the European Union for Ukraine not only as a value-based and economic union, but also as security for Ukraine. The European Union is economic and institutional security for Ukraine. And Ukraine is a factor of unity for the European Union. The same will happen with NATO. And this is no longer a dream - it is already a reality. We are now a recipient of security assistance. But the victorious Ukraine will be a donor of security for our region, for the whole of Europe, for the whole world. And Ukraine is already a donor of moral strength. Anyone who cooperates effectively with Ukraine becomes a co-defender of the international order and universal values. In particular, NATO has had two fundamental weaknesses in recent years. First, there were doubts as to whether Article Five of the NATO Treaty would actually work. And we have all witnessed the world questioning whether the Alliance would defend the countries on NATO&#x27;s eastern flank in the event of Russian aggression against them. Secondly, many in the world did not and do not perceive NATO as a defensive alliance, attributing to it - as a result of appropriate propaganda - some allegedly aggressive goals. Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the Alliance will reliably eliminate these two weaknesses of NATO. First, no one any longer doubts that Ukraine is capable of defending itself and its allies. The strength of our security is also the strength of the security of our neighbors. Secondly, everyone in the world has seen that Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine is unprovoked and criminal - aggressive and genocidal. Ukraine&#x27;s accession to NATO will be a powerful signal to the world that this is an Alliance that protects and will protect, and this is an Alliance that has the experience of winners and the moral superiority of winners - winners in a completely just defense. The entire eastern flank of NATO wants the United States, Germany, France, or Britain to deploy their soldiers in eastern Europe - near Russia&#x27;s borders. After Ukraine&#x27;s victory, the allies will want our combat brigades to be deployed on the land of our neighbors. Because Ukraine is a country of strength, everyone can see that. NATO will guarantee security for Ukraine, and our Defense and Security Forces will guarantee security and protection for other NATO members. For this to become a reality, there is only one thing that is needed: all our Allied partners should stop looking back to the Kremlin when making their important decisions. Even Russia&#x27;s own internal forces have already stopped looking back to the Kremlin&#x27;s weak master. Putin&#x27;s madness has resulted in him driving himself into a dead end bunker because of his own weakness. Therefore, it is absurd to look back to such a failed leader of such a failed state. Ukraine&#x27;s victory will free the world from such a problem as dangerous Russia. History proves that the defeat of a dictatorship is always an impetus for the spread of freedom. Ukraine&#x27;s victory is a guarantee of security and restoration of territorial integrity for Moldova. Ukraine&#x27;s victory is a historic chance for the territorial integrity of Georgia, and it is a peaceful chance. Ukraine&#x27;s victory is a new strength for the entire South Caucasus. Ukraine&#x27;s victory is freedom and peace for Belarus. Moreover, the liberation of Crimea from Russian occupation and a guaranteed safe Black Sea, together with the defeat of ruscism, will provide the necessary energy for the Baltic-Black Sea axis to work at the level of its real security, economic, and cultural capabilities. Ukraine&#x27;s victory is a guarantee of security and protection from external manipulation, whether military or political, for the entire Central Asia. Ukraine&#x27;s victory is a chance for the Middle East to de-escalate terror. Ukraine&#x27;s victory is a guarantee that African countries from Libya to the Central African Republic will no longer be robbed by Russian thugs. And what will happen to Russia itself after our victory? I believe that Ukrainians should not care whether freedom will overcome the Kremlin&#x27;s walls. Ukrainians only care about ensuring that Russian revanchism never again crosses the borders of our free state and threatens our free people. We will ensure this! As a full member of NATO, Ukraine will guarantee that peace and freedom will prevail everywhere in our region. And it would be right for Russia to ask for Ukraine&#x27;s membership in NATO now, because NATO members defend and do not destroy... NATO states protect peoples, not attack their neighbors to destroy their future. Russia, as an aggressor, knows this better than anyone. Russia, which is entering an era of rebellions and systemic weakness, is more than anyone else interested in security on its internationally recognized borders. This means that Russia is also interested in Ukraine as a member of NATO. This may not be visible to someone only from Moscow or Valday bunkers. The whole world sees it! The modern Russian statehood poses an existential threat to Ukraine and does not respect any treaties whose force is not backed by the power of available weapons to defend Ukraine. Therefore, regardless of how the global agenda on Russia evolves, Ukraine will have the necessary weapons to defend itself and its allies against any Russian encroachment on our sovereignty and the safety of our people. Ukraine will have a sufficient number and quality of the army and the Defense and Security Forces in general to protect its sovereignty, its territory, its people, and its allies. Glory to Ukraine! Ukraine will have a sufficiently powerful defense industry to meet the needs of our army, our navy, our sky shield, and our security in cyberspace. This is very important. At the bottom of the Black Sea, there is already very strong evidence of Ukraine&#x27;s capability as a missile-producing state. The Neptunes, which were put into service in 2020, hit their targets accurately. Now, during such a war and against all odds, we have established virtually from scratch the production of scarce artillery shells, actual artillery. We have resumed production of 122-mm and 125-mm shells and other calibers. We are starting to replace 152-mm production with 155-mm Western standard. The Ukrainian artillery has been created already now, during this full-scale Russian aggression. Let&#x27;s applaud all the people who have done this. Let&#x27;s thank them that this is not a dream - it is a reality again. High-quality Ukrainian artillery, our own production of shells. We understand that the volume of production is not yet sufficient. We still need global support. But it will be sufficient, we will be able to do it! Ukraine has learned to build naval drones. And we are successfully using them! In general, the production of various types of drones is an industry that should become the most powerful in Europe in Ukraine. Anyone in the world who wants to be at the forefront of this modern industry should know that Ukraine has the most favorable conditions for this. A clear, concrete benchmark for government policy. We strive to produce and localize in Ukraine the necessary weapons systems - air defense systems, tanks, artillery, armored vehicles - supplied by our partners. Our warriors will always have weapons! And I propose the following principle for the Ukrainian Doctrine, its global security component: not to guess what to expect from Russia, but to be prepared for any evil, so that any evil in Russia is always sure that it will lose against Ukraine. Never again is the key principle of the Ukrainian Doctrine in relation to Russia. Never again. This also applies to the old spiritual dependence that was used by the aggressor to put pressure on our country. Ukraine&#x27;s spiritual independence will be ensured - one hundred percent. And the strongest internal guarantor of the effectiveness of this principle – &quot;never again&quot; – is our heroes. Everyone who fights for Ukraine. And everyone who gave and gives life for Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! Please observe a moment of silence in memory of all our heroes of different times who fought for Ukraine&#x27;s freedom and independence. Please do so. Thank you. Our dear defenders! Dear relatives of our warriors! The Ukrainian state needs new principles of gratitude to you, gratitude to all those who fought in the war for Ukraine&#x27;s freedom and independence. The invaluable experience of Ukrainian warriors should be effectively used in the process of ensuring real security for the world. This sounds generic, but it can be deciphered into quite specific elements of the policy of heroes that I propose for the Ukrainian Doctrine. First. Our warriors who wish to continue serving the Ukrainian state and people after the war can be sure that the state will have such a request. Second. Ukraine is already the only country in the world with a successful experience of effective defense against full-scale aggression. The victorious Ukraine will have even more of this important, valuable experience. And we are developing a platform for exporting Ukrainian defense knowledge and practices - real experience of our heroes. The participation of Ukrainians in peacekeeping missions, particularly under the auspices of the United Nations, international training missions... All of these are enormous opportunities for Ukraine and for our heroes. Third. Ukraine needs a fundamentally new system of military education. Ukrainian warriors and all those who train Ukrainian warriors should know that real practice will be the basis of the new Ukrainian military education. The state will integrate the training programs that have now proven their effectiveness, as well as the real combat experience of our soldiers and sailors, sergeants, foremen, officers, and our generals, into the military education system. Fourth. The world&#x27;s leaders are already showing interest in training their future warriors in Ukraine. And this will definitely become one of the opportunities that will make Ukraine&#x27;s security influence truly global and worldwide. Fifth. Ukraine needs to fully integrate veterans into social and economic life. The heroes of our victory should be able to prove themselves as heroes of our transformation. Servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the National Guard, our border guards, our intelligence officers, heroes of the special services, the police - all of them! In particular, the transformation of Ukrainian military education will include the possibility for our warriors to obtain a related civilian specialty. Sixth. The main principle of social work with veterans in the victorious Ukraine is &quot;equal with equal&quot;. The state must create a system of support for the warriors and the families of our warriors that will guarantee them that their every emotion and need will be understood by the person helping them, because this person has gone through the war, has gone through losses, has gone through everything that needs to be understood to be effective in integrating veterans into social and economic life. Warriors are the most effective helpers for other warriors, and the relatives of our warriors are the most effective helpers for other relatives of warriors. Seventh. Ukraine&#x27;s policy of heroes requires a real national standard of a barrier-free environment. These are new requirements for urban planning, infrastructure, public space, transportation, social and educational systems, and business environment. Requirements that will allow every person with war trauma to enjoy the same space and opportunities as others. Eighth. The barrier-free environment also has a psychological component, so the need for mental rehabilitation is the same as the need for physical rehabilitation. Ukraine needs to create the strongest rehabilitation industry in Europe. This applies to both the construction of rehabilitation centers and the training of relevant personnel. The state will facilitate the creation of the necessary number of jobs not only to provide rehabilitation for our people, but also to enable us to become a global exporter of practices of recovery and integration into post-war life for absolutely everyone who has experienced and suffered from war. All the world&#x27;s best practices, all the most effective policies, all the solutions, no matter how difficult or unusual they may seem to us, must be applied in Ukraine so that Ukrainians, all our citizens do not have to endure the pain, stress, and trauma of war. In particular, we must finally fairly legalize cannabis-based medicines for all those who need them, with appropriate scientific research and controlled Ukrainian production. Ninth. Veterans in the civil service in Ukraine, in councils of various levels, and in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine are an honor for the state. Hiring veterans is an honor for any business. Helping veterans start their own business is an honor for the state, for every community, for every business association, and for anyone who knows what it means to be at war. And this should not be a dream, it should be a reality in Ukraine! This is a large-scale national task. And I will say frankly: to accomplish this task faster and better, the state will need help. I ask our volunteers to help the state with this. Please start studying the experience of the world in terms of economic and social integration, rehabilitation of veterans, and relevant state and municipal changes in countries around the world. So that Ukraine, our victorious state, can channel the best in our warriors into the best for Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! I would like you to thank all Ukrainian volunteers, each and every one of them, for this extraordinary strength, for their reliability, for their historic contribution to the defense of Ukrainian freedom, to the defense of our lives, to the defense of our independence. We are grateful to you! And the tenth point of the policy of heroes, which I propose to discuss when creating the Ukrainian Doctrine, is the culture of heroes. Memorializing the war and the experience of our victory. Creating a Pantheon of Heroes and a National Military Cemetery. Establishment of a National Museum of the Russian-Ukrainian War and a system of local museums that will honor the memory of the war and preserve the experience of victory for future generations of the Ukrainian people. Creative reflection on the experience of war, exporting the experience of our victory by means of culture. Creating an official history of the war, defining a national canon of interpretation of the war with Russia - participants in the war, key events of the war, stages of the war, Russian war crimes and achievements of our Ukrainian resistance. A new cultural policy regarding our heroes of different times who fought for Ukraine&#x27;s freedom and independence, and the reburial in Ukraine of all our heroes who are buried abroad. This is very important. The victorious Ukraine will promote all forms of developing a culture of heroes in Ukraine. And I have focused so much on the policy of heroes for the victorious Ukraine because any ineffectiveness of this policy will deprive everything else that will be happening in our country of moral meaning. We must make our policy of heroes as effective as possible! The policy of justice in Ukraine is directly related to this. Justice is the number one requirement of everyone in our country for domestic life, and of our country for the world. I&#x27;ll start with internal justice. Recently, the Dniprovskyi District Court of Kyiv delivered a verdict in the case of a brutal assault on Kateryna Handziuk. On July 31, 2018, the attackers doused Kateryna with concentrated sulfuric acid. She died of severe burns in hospital on November 4, 2018. May she rest in peace! In 2019 and 2020, the perpetrators of this crime were convicted. Now there is a verdict for the hirer and co-organizer of the assault. The court found them guilty and sentenced them to 10 years in prison. We have to be honest: if it had not been for the persistent pressure and constant attention of civil society and Kateryna&#x27;s friends, if it had not been for various rallies, protests and calls to punish those who ordered the crime, justice would have been destroyed at the very beginning. The criminals counted on this. They were sure, as always, of impunity. I am grateful to everyone who fought for justice in this case, to everyone who worked properly to ensure legitimate verdicts. But this should have happened without public pressure! We have all recently seen the case of the former head of the Supreme Court. Greed that discredits the judicial institution. A man who sows despair, humiliation, and anger in Ukraine with his behavior. And he sows it from the highest judicial authority. There are other examples of injustice that are outrageous and simply demotivating, including for our warriors. People sacrifice the most valuable - their lives and health - for the sake of the state. And state institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement, must undergo a transformation that will protect our society from injustice. The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine has proposed to increase the accountability of judges and other judicial officials for crimes in the field of justice and corruption. We also propose to tighten the rules for checking the integrity of judges, including the use of lie detectors and polygraphs. We must also attach a new, significant importance to jury trials as one of the elements of democracy in the state. I know that relevant legislative initiatives are already being prepared. I am asking you, dear Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, dear deputies, to support this request for justice. Now, when we will define the parameters of our Ukrainian Doctrine and the transformation of our state, we must consider the policy of justice on a par with the policy of the Ukrainian victory, the policy of Ukraine&#x27;s security, and the policy of our heroes. Justice is a social order in which a person wants to live in a country because he or she feels that his or her life, health, work, dignity, pursuit of happiness, family, and future are reliably protected by law and fair justice within a reasonable time frame that actually works. The sense of justice in Ukraine should be the strongest in Europe! And it will be so! We must achieve this. This is an ambitious goal, but Ukraine knows how to make the ambitious ordinary. We have to find all the necessary systemic solutions to satisfy the Ukrainian thirst for justice. Now regarding another justice - in relation to the Russian-Ukrainian war. The issue of justice regarding war and genocidal policies is never easy. But in this case, with Russia&#x27;s aggression against our freedom, the more difficulties and hesitations the world has regarding justice for Ukraine and Ukrainians, the greater, unfortunately, revanchist sentiments in different parts of the world may become. The inevitability of punishment is one of the main tools for deterring crime. Just as it can work effectively within national jurisdictions, it will work in global relations. All Russian murderers, terrorists, and torturers must be held accountable for their crimes against Ukrainians. The political and military leadership of Russia must not avoid justice on the grounds that they allegedly have immunity as leaders of the state. They are not leaders of the state, they are bandits who have seized control of Russia&#x27;s state institutions, and they have become absolutely arrogant with this impunity and have begun to terrorize the world. Every political bandit puts himself outside the scope of any usual international relations. And every asset that belongs to a terrorist state or to any individuals from the circle of the President of the Russian Federation who are associated with the current system of rule in Russia must be used to compensate those for whom this war and the aggressiveness of this rule have resulted in burned cities and villages, and the loss of loved ones. I am grateful to everyone in the world who perceives the Russian political and military leadership in this way - as individuals who must end their careers in the dock in The Hague. And Russian assets - as those that must be frozen, confiscated and used to compensate for the damage caused by Russian aggression. Ukraine will do its utmost to ensure that the Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against our country is established and starts working in reality - with criminals in the dock. I would like to thank the International Criminal Court for being as decisive as it needs to be to protect international law and humanity. The time will come when international arrest warrants for Russian rulers and their accomplices will not be sensational, but simply a common working tool of global justice. Because if this is not the case, other potential aggressors and other terrorist states will feel the same impunity as Russia. And our Ukrainian mission is, in particular, to create this historical precedent of aggressor&#x27;s accountability for everything committed in war. Part of justice is the world&#x27;s true attitude to our war for freedom and independence, as well as to other pages of our history that were distorted by one form of totalitarian evil or another. It is the duty of the Ukrainian state to honor the memory of all victims of the Holodomor, the genocide of the Ukrainian people, as well as all victims of the deportation of the Crimean Tatar people, and all victims of the Holocaust. Dear attendees! Please, let us now thank all Ukrainian and international journalists, all our Ukrainian and foreign historians who are spreading the truth about this aggression, about Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine, about our life and about justice for our people. Thank you! Dear Ukrainians! The fifth guideline for the Ukrainian Doctrine, which I would like to propose for discussion today, is transformation in ten years. In this time, we have to overcome a path that other nations have been overcoming for decades, and this is true. The victorious Ukraine will get special attention and trust from the world, and every manifestation of such attention and trust should be directed to the development of Ukraine and all aspects of life in our country. First. The specific goal for Ukraine&#x27;s GDP is a trillion dollars. Yes, this is a very high bar, and it seems unrealistic, but Ukraine&#x27;s potential is capable of achieving it. Second. The victorious Ukraine will abandon the idea that the labor of Ukrainians is supposed to be cheap, because the cheap labor of our people was supposed to be a competitive advantage of Ukraine. Our goal is to reach a level of wages that could be determined by the formula &quot;neighbors in the European Union plus 30%&quot;. This is a goal, a fair goal, for this war. The victorious Ukraine will rely primarily on skilled labor. And therefore, on education. The Government of Ukraine and the team of Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation Fedorov are currently developing a program to significantly modernize Ukrainian education and stimulate the development of science in Ukraine. It is a very detailed program that deserves attention, and it contains many solutions that deserve discussion and, if approved by our government and the nation, implementation. The educational section of the Ukrainian Doctrine should be elaborated as much as possible - every stage of the educational process, all the elements that are important for education in Ukraine. A nation that wants to be a leader makes education a leader. And it makes education fair. We must also honestly say that in today&#x27;s world, the language of global cooperation is English. And it is true. It is the language of global business, global science and global communication. The Ukraine of the future, the victorious Ukraine, requires the spread of English so that Ukrainian interests can spread around the world and our people can gain new global opportunities for themselves and for Ukraine. By the way, today I have submitted a relevant legislative initiative on the English language in Ukraine to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Third. We are facing an overwhelming challenge to bring home as many of our people who have left the country as possible. So, the victorious Ukraine needs as many new jobs as possible that will be attractive to our people, that will allow them to live in Ukraine more decently than in other countries. The transformation of every sector of the economy, every social practice, and all spheres of public administration must answer the question of how many new jobs a particular solution or initiative will create in Ukraine. Fourth. Ukraine needs a new policy of support for parenthood and childhood. The second and third child in a family is happiness, not a limitation of opportunities, and it is this happiness that state policy should work for. Ukraine will support parenthood at all stages. Ukraine will respect every family and will do everything to ensure that family upbringing is the defining feature in Ukraine. Our country is not for boarding schools. Fifth. Ukrainian Diia has become a global example of social progress. We did it when no one believed that such a project to develop the capabilities of citizens and the entire country could succeed. But we did it. The app has over 19 million users. My congratulations to you. And the absolute usefulness of Diia. Now, the Ukrainian Diia is becoming an export product of our country - we are teaching other nations to digitize based on our digitized services, based on our Diia. And we will create another system, the Ukrainian Mriia. A special app that will support everything related to parents and children. Services that parents need, that children need. Development and education. Security and contact with the state. Mriia will help provide equal access to knowledge from any corner of the world, and the use of artificial intelligence will help each child build their own unique educational trajectory for success. Ukraine&#x27;s digital transformation team will present this Mriia in the autumn. Sixth. Protecting business is as important as protecting employees and labor. To make the welfare and economic development indicators, which are a dream now, a reality, the victorious Ukraine must be a country of business and a country of labor. Just as millions of our people are now fighting and working in unity for our victory, we must work in unity after our victory to ensure that Ukraine is among the world&#x27;s economic leaders. Economic leadership brings security. Everyone who creates new jobs in Ukraine creates the basis for Ukraine&#x27;s economic leadership. The victorious Ukraine will protect the right of every person to work as long and as hard as he or she wishes. We need to modernize labor legislation. Seventh. The victorious Ukraine needs a new rational tax agreement between the state and society and real legalization of property. I am a supporter of tax cuts. But now, in this time of war and Ukraine&#x27;s obvious dependence on cooperation with financial donors, we cannot afford to cut taxes. But when the victorious Ukraine becomes a donor to the world itself, our level of opportunities will be higher. Reduced taxes should mean increased tax compliance. Digitalization offers tremendous opportunities to simplify relations in the field of taxes, customs and all other areas where there is a meeting or any contact between a citizen and an official, between a businessman and an official. Our goal is to have a tax office without tax officers and customs without customs officers. Automatic digital procedures. Eighth.Transformation is bigger than rebuilding. Of course, the victorious Ukraine will become Europe&#x27;s largest construction site. We need to rebuild hundreds of towns and villages, thousands of infrastructure facilities, hundreds of thousands of houses. This will give a boost to the economy. But the main thing is something else. We have to forget about our past as a raw material exporter. The victorious Ukraine is a country of high value added goods. It is a country where regulations allow the development of any business that is an innovator in its field and where intellectual property is protected. The victorious Ukraine is a country that exports security, services, experience, culture, and, in general, the results of intellectual activity, technological products more than any raw materials. Ninth. The victorious Ukraine is a country where no one can be called an oligarch, because all economic entities are equal before the law. Ukraine is interested in new technology businesses that will matter more in the global market than any old raw materials business. And objectively, we have a natural advantage, and that is our natural resource reserves. These include metals and minerals that are particularly valuable for modern industries, such as lithium and graphite. However, the metallurgy in the victorious Ukraine must be green to meet the modern environmental standards of the European Union and not focused on the export of raw materials. We will develop cooperation and economic relations with all global players. In particular, with India, Africa, Latin America, the Arab world, with China, with everyone. Tenth. Our energy potential allows Ukraine to become one of the guarantors of Europe&#x27;s energy security. The entire continent needs our generation, including nuclear power. But I would like us to support our power engineers and thank them for this winter. Thank you very much! Our country&#x27;s massive priority is green generation and large-scale energy accumulation capacities. We have to make Ukraine&#x27;s green energy potential a potential for real massive earnings for our people. Eleventh. The victorious Ukraine is a country that has implemented pension reform - and we really want and need it - and guaranteed decent future support for all those who work today. The existing solidarity pension system alone is not enough, and you know it, and the vast majority of our Ukrainian pensioners feel it. And I am asking you, dear MPs, to realize all this. To realize the dream of Ukrainians. The victorious Ukraine will do everything to ensure that our elderly people, who are already retired, have a higher standard of living. The victorious Ukraine will do everything to ensure that those who work today have a truly secure retirement. Twelfth. Ukrainian culture is an export industry. And it is an industry that generates constant and significant attention of the world to the victorious Ukraine. The victorious Ukraine needs this kind of view of the cultural sector. Currently, the cultural sector needs at least one percent of GDP per year as a basic level for survival. But it is clear that the industry should and must be more ambitious. Ukrainian courage has indeed awakened a tremendous interest of people from different countries in us, in Ukrainians, in our cities and villages of Ukraine. Every such interest is an opportunity. Ukraine needs a new policy for protecting public space in cities and communities that can be used as cultural space or preserves a particular historical value. Ukraine needs a new museum and memorial policy. Unfortunately, entire generations of Ukrainian greatness remain without museum expression. At the same time, the existing museums do not meet the spirit and standards of modern museums. Ukraine needs a new policy of books and book publishing, writing and reading, translating foreign books for Ukraine, and spreading the Ukrainian language and Ukrainian books in the world. Support for bookstores. Audiobooks. Digital subscription services. Rethinking our Ukrainian libraries. Basically, we must ensure a clear annual increase in the number of books by Ukrainians, books for Ukrainians, and books by Ukrainians for the whole world. Ukraine needs a new cinematography policy and support for filmmaking. Ukrainians should make films, and the world should make films about Ukraine and in Ukraine. We all know what solutions are needed for this. Thirteenth. Ukraine needs a new policy of territories. Each region liberated from Russian occupation needs its own very detailed and at the same time holistic, visionary transformation policy. The new free Ukrainian Crimea - what is it like? Can it become a new California in Europe, a place that attracts talent? With a cluster of modern technology companies, IT, creative industries, and a truly modern hospitality industry. A Crimea that works all year round, not just three months. The new free Donbas - what is it like? Will it be industrial? The new free Ukrainian Pryazovia. What exactly will attract people to move to this part of our beautiful country? Kherson and Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kupyansk, Melitopol and Mariupol... What will the new life look like in these cities of Ukraine, victorious cities? And these are very important questions, and we must have an answer to them and answer them together. Each of our regions, each of our cities, each of our communities needs its own vision. Obviously, Odesa is not only a globally important port. Kharkiv is obviously not only an outpost of freedom on the eastern border of Europe. It is obvious. But Odesa and Kharkiv deserve to be among the European leaders, and the victorious Ukraine needs a new policy for the sake of such cities, for the sake of all our cities, for the sake of Kharkiv. A new policy for the sake of Odesa. Obviously, Kharkiv will be an outpost of freedom and strength on the eastern border of Europe. But what will make Kharkiv one of the leading European cities? Obviously, Dnipro, Lviv, Uzhhorod, Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this war have not only faced new problems, but also received new opportunities. How can the state help cities realize these opportunities? This is very important. I ask everyone to be very specific in the discussion about the transformation of Ukraine. Fourteenth. Internal security. Russian aggression has shown us what security standards are needed for life. Accessibility of shelters - maximum. Schools - with a shelter. Hospitals - with a shelter. Houses - with a shelter. Ukrainians will trust specific things that provide specific security. In Ukraine, children should be taught security from childhood. This is the kind of neighbor we have. Every adult Ukrainian should know basic first aid principles. Physical culture and sports education are not entertainment today, they are one of the foundations of security. Because this is human health, this is the health of the nation, this is the strength of Ukrainians. The main thing is to provide opportunities. Active parks for active people. More opportunities for children. Different opportunities. Implementation of very specific programs. We have to settle the issue of weapons that are and will be in the hands of our people. This is a fact. This is a controversial issue for our society, like any other democratic society. But the answer should be reflected in the Ukrainian Doctrine. In very specific things. Mine clearance. This is one of the biggest challenges for Ukraine. But we know what needs to be done. The world has the technologies. Ukrainian needs – our partners are aware of all this. And although it is often said that demining the entire territory of Ukraine, which is unfortunately contaminated with Russian mines, will take decades, we know that it is possible to do it faster – in years. Everyday security. Of course, society has completely different views on the use of surveillance cameras on the streets and roads, and on the automatic analytical capabilities of surveillance systems. But it is obvious that they will help reduce the level of violations and crime, traffic-related deaths and incidents on the streets. This is necessary. Combating domestic violence. This is an important area in which, unfortunately, an increase in cases of domestic violence is being recorded, and especially at this time. Minister of Internal Affairs Klymenko and his team are working in detail on each of these areas of internal security and, I am sure, are ready to present their proposals to the public for national discussion. And finally, the fifteenth point. Neighborhood policy. Why is this point the last among the guidelines I want to propose today? Because a strong neighborhood is always the result of very different, very profound things. In fact, a successful neighborhood can summarize any of our other successes in our country, in our region, and in global relations. Economy and culture. Defense and security. Transport and communication. Education and attitude to history. Interaction between states and interaction between us, between people... All this determines the quality of neighborhood. It determines whether there is understanding between neighbors. Poland, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia, Hungary. Our neighbors in the Black Sea region – Bulgaria, Türkiye, Georgia. Relations with each of them require a separate and detailed presentation of what has been achieved as well as opportunities, existing challenges and prospects. But what do they all have in common for us? They, like us, want to live in peace on their land. Just as they are now helping us to defend freedom, Ukraine will always help them to defend their lives. Peace will always reign in our region, in our Europe. Peace that will be the sum of security and freedom that we have to establish. For the new Ukraine! The victorious Ukraine. The winner. This is a fact. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia and its accomplices must feel that the price of their terror will only increase for them - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-28</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! First of all, regarding yesterday&#x27;s Russian attack on Kramatorsk. Today, work continued all day at the site of the attack. Unfortunately, the death toll has increased. Russian missiles claimed the lives of 11 of our people, including three children. My condolences to the families. More than 60 people were injured and wounded. Today, the Security Service of Ukraine together with the police special forces detained the person who coordinated this terrorist attack. They hit an ordinary cafe in Kramatorsk, a popular pizzeria. Neighboring houses, shops, and a gas station were damaged. An ordinary city, an ordinary life. There may still be people under the rubble. Everyone who helps Russian terrorists destroy life deserves the maximum punishment. And this applies not only to some collaborators. Everything is clear about them. These are people without humanity. Anyone in the world who does not understand that one cannot be an accomplice of a terrorist state must be held accountable by the entire international community. The spotter is being charged with treason. The possible punishment is life imprisonment. Accomplices of a terrorist state must be treated as betrayers of humanity. We will continue our work to strengthen international sanctions against Russia and its accomplices. They must feel that the price of their terror will only increase for them. And we will continue our global legal work to ensure that international instruments work in one way or another to punish all Russian terrorists and the aggressor state itself. Today, in my address to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the occasion of Constitution Day, I spoke, in particular, about justice. I spoke about internal justice, which is about accountability for violations of law in Ukraine. And about justice in relation to the Russian-Ukrainian war - about Russia&#x27;s accountability for war crimes. The policy of justice will be one of the foundations of the Ukrainian Doctrine, a fundamental document that will determine the course of our country for decades. We need such a document. Everyone in Ukraine, all our neighbors, everyone in the world should know what our national goal is, what we consider to be the end of this war, and how we are going to live after this war. No matter what the occupiers try to do against us and no matter what kind of terror they use, they will not be able to break Ukraine. They will not succeed in knocking us off the path that leads the occupiers to accountability for everything they have done against us and that leads us to our guaranteed security and lasting freedom. Ukraine and everyone in the world who stands with us in defense of freedom will also stand in defense of justice. Justice for all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror, whose fate was broken by the Russian war. Eternal memory to all our people, to all Ukrainian children who were killed by Russian savages! I would like to briefly report on the day. The Presidents of Lithuania and Poland, Gitanas Nausėda and Andrzej Duda, paid a visit. A very timely and useful visit on the eve of Vilnius. The format of the talks was both joint and bilateral. Weapons for Ukraine. By the way, thank you, Gitanas, Mr. President, for the decision to purchase and transfer NASAMS systems to Ukraine, as it is very much needed. We discussed common political challenges in the entire region and between our countries. Of course, we also talked about the launch of negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union, which we expect to happen this year. I met with Chief Master Sergeant of the 47th separate mechanized brigade &quot;Magura&quot; Valerii Markus. We talked about the war, our warriors, and our defense. We also discussed the reform of record keeping in military structures. Less paperwork and bureaucracy, more digitalization. We discussed the reform of the sergeant corps. It was a good conversation. Thank you for the chevrons! Today, on the Constitution Day of Ukraine, I had the honor to award our warriors and hand over state awards to the families of our heroes. It was very emotional, very honorable. I am proud of our warriors! I am grateful for everything and for the saved life of Ukraine! Congratulations to everyone on Constitution Day and, most importantly, I wish us all, each and every one in our country, to multiply freedom, glory and independence of Ukraine! And so it will be! I also congratulate all Muslims of Ukraine and the world on the beginning of Kurban Bayram. May we all achieve peace for our country, for our countries, for our children. A fair and just peace. I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! I am grateful to each and every one who is now in combat, at combat posts and in positions. Thank you, warriors, for your new advancement! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This is a historic time to start negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the meeting of the European Council</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear Charles, dear colleagues! Thank you very much, greetings to you all and thank you for inviting me! I started this week with a visit to the frontline. Two of our regions – Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. Most of the combat operations, both offensive and defensive, are concentrated there. The fighting is highly intensive there, and our people are outstanding heroes! Our soldiers are doing a great job, and I am proud of them, every one of them who is now on the ground, fending-off Russian attacks and destroying Russian terrorists. We manage to liberate our land and people from the occupiers, and this is the most important thing. The more successful our soldiers are now, the longer Russia will not pose a threat to Ukraine and our entire Europe. History clearly demonstrates that unsuccessful aggressions always make dictatorships weak. In fact, this is what we are seeing in Russia right now – we are seeing their weakness, which we so badly need. The weaker Russia is, and the more its bosses fear mutinies and uprisings, the more they will fear to irritate us. Russia&#x27;s weakness will make it safe for others, and its defeat will solve the problem of this war. Dear colleagues, partners! I am grateful to all of you who’re helping our defense against Russian aggression! Thank you for every air defense system provided to us – they do save lives. It’s true. Thank you for the European initiative on a million shells and rounds for Ukraine, for our tank coalition and for all the defense packages that have been provided to our country. This is truly historic cooperation for the defense of Europe. Ukraine is grateful to Lithuania and Poland, and we will not allow Russia or its terrorist groups to even try to undermine the security of the Lithuanian and Polish people from the territory of Belarus. For Ukraine, the security of our partners is also our security. Yesterday, Mr. President Nausėda and Mr. President Duda visited Ukraine, and we exchanged assessments of the situation in Belarus and the challenges it presents. Ukraine&#x27;s position is absolutely clear – any attempt to blackmail Europe, any attempt to do something against Europe should be treated equally by the whole Europe. If someone somewhere threatens one or another European nation, it is absolutely natural to stand up for that nation and eliminate the threat. Another important thing to mention in the context of security is sanctions. I am grateful for the recently adopted eleventh sanctions package of the European Union, which continues the fair policy of pressure on everyone who makes aggression possible. It is important not to stop imposing sanctions. The fewer pauses there are, the less Russia will adapt to the pressure on it and the less it will think of ways to circumvent the sanctions. I am grateful that the eleventh sanctions package pays attention to Russia&#x27;s attempts to circumvent sanctions through third countries, and this attention should be strengthened in the twelfth EU sanctions package. Many of the missiles that Russian terrorists are now using against life in Ukraine are newly produced and contain critical components made by companies in the free world. This cannot be tolerated. Together we must stop Russia&#x27;s use of free world technologies for aggression against freedom. We also cannot tolerate what Russia is doing to our Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Let me remind you, that – this is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Russian terrorists have mined it – we have specific information from our intelligence, and we have presented it, in particular, to diplomats of European countries. As well as information about Russia&#x27;s use of foreign parts for missile production. The Russian nuclear industry deserves sanctions in response to Russian radiation blackmail. Dear colleagues! Tomorrow, the Swedish presidency comes to an end, and I would like to thank Sweden and personally Prime Minister Kristersson for their effective work. Over these six months, Europe has become stronger. I’m sure of it. On behalf of all Ukrainians, I want to thank you, dear leaders, and you, Charles, you, Ursula, you, Roberta, for making important economic and political decisions that help us defend our freedom and Europe. Unfortunately, there are things that do not help us. But, if solidarity continues to work, if our security and economic cooperation is not broken by artificial and illegal restrictions, if Europe&#x27;s long-term and principled decisions continue to send signals to the world that Europe believes in peace, then this war will definitely not drag on. I am grateful for the extension of our free trade with Europe and transit for another year. Every manifestation of solidarity, every manifestation of unity is now lifesaving. I am grateful for the proposal of a long-term financial instrument of the EU in the amount of 50 billion euros announced by the President of the European Commission von der Leyen, and if this proposal is approved, it will be the right signal that Europe believes in peace, believes in Ukraine. It is very important that the European Parliament always gives principled assessments of what is happening, and immediately condemned the Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. This attack led to the largest ecocide in Europe in decades, and those responsible must be held accountable. It is important that the European Council also condemn this horrific Russian terrorist attack and ecocide at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. I would like to note that if there is no strong reaction from European leaders and countries to the Russian crime at the Kakhovka HPP, it may give Russian terrorists more arrogance with regard to the Zaporizhzhia NPP. And, in any case, it is destructive when Russia uses a nuclear power plant for radiation blackmail and at the same time discusses the construction of new nuclear units with EU member states. How can we trust a terrorist to build nuclear units? Sorry, but it’s a rhetorical question. And finally, a few thoughts on the next six months for Europe. I believe it is symbolic that this Saturday, on the first day of Spain&#x27;s presidency, Mr. Sanchez, the Prime Minister of Spain, will visit Ukraine at my invitation. For the first time, the beginning of a country&#x27;s presidency will be emphasized by a visit to Ukraine. And this actually says a lot about how important the next six months will be for our Europe. This is a historic time to start negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the EU. A Europe of values, a free and strong Europe, a Europe of peace is unthinkable without Ukraine. We are ready to start accession negotiations, and our progress in implementing the European Commission&#x27;s recommendations has to be fixed. Ukraine is determined to be fully prepared for the start of accession negotiations as soon as possible, and we will do so. Peace has no alternatives. So, maximum unity in Europe has no alternatives. Thank you very much for your attention! Thank you for your support, friends! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Chatham House 2022 Award Ceremony: This award for Ukraine is another proof that the world believes in our country, Ukrainians and our victory</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear friends! I am grateful for your attention to Ukraine and your respect for Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers, all our beautiful people really deserve the highest honors. Millions of our people fight and work for our freedom, our common freedom – Ukrainian and all free nations. I am sure that we will keep our freedom. And your award, in particular... The Chatham House Prize for Ukraine is another proof that the world believes in Ukraine, believes in Ukrainians, believes in our victory. Ladies and Gentlemen! Thousands and thousands of our warriors distinguished themselves in battles against the invaders. Today, my advisors prepared three new decrees on awarding state awards to our heroes. At once to 419 of our warriors, men and women, who are fighting for freedom with their blood, pain, loss of their brothers in arms. I want you to know that every day we have success on the frontline thanks to our heroic soldiers! And, of course, thanks to the support of our partners – and the United Kingdom is one of the obvious leaders in this support. Thank you very much! Every day our soldiers repel Russian assaults, step by step they liberate our land and people, every day we make Russian tyranny weaker – as it should be for our world to be safe. During the full-scale war, more than 49 thousand of our soldiers are awarded with state awards for bravery in battles. 245 soldiers are awarded with the title of the Hero of Ukraine. Imagine how intense the fighting is and how strong our people are! Such a number of well-deserved awards for special bravery and courage reflects the mass bravery and courage of Ukrainians. Please always support our people – they deserve it. And I believe, that – the day will come very, very soon when Ukrainian contribution to the global freedom and the strength of our people will be recognized by a legitimate recognition of our state – an ally of your state and all free nations, NATO members. We must honestly admit: peace in Europe is the Alliance. So that aggression against one or another European nation never repeats again and so that such self-sacrifice of soldiers is never needed again, security institutions, in particular Euro-Atlantic institutions, must really protect peace. And now it is real – only together with Ukraine. Which will be free, strong and, of course, in NATO. Only together with our heroes. Glory to all Ukrainian heroes! Thank you again for this day. Thank you for your support! Thank you, United Kingdom! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Combating ecocide is one of the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, and we must implement each of its points - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-29</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! I am finishing the day in the Verkhovna Rada with a meeting with our Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk. We are working. And now the report on this day, a busy day. A very long one. The European Council meeting - it is already a tradition for Ukraine to be among the members of the European Union. The agenda is obvious: our defense in this war, our path to victory, support from our partners, our security support for them, for our entire Europe. Ukraine influences the strength of Europe. This is a fact. And this year, it is time to use this and other similar facts to strengthen unity in Europe, including by starting negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union. The meeting with Mike Pence, the 48th Vice President of the United States, Senator... American support for Ukraine is vital - from all Americans, every American family, all U.S. civil society, all political leaders, Congress - both parties, of course, from President Biden. Thank you for this support! I discussed with Mr. Pence our defense, our cooperation - from the very beginning, from the very first days between the Ukrainian and American nations. We talked about weapons, about the capabilities of our soldiers, about our common values. The meeting with the members of the International Working Group on the Environmental Consequences of War - Greta Thunberg, Margot Wallström and others. We talked primarily about the Russian terrorist attack and ecocide at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and the work of our group, which will deal with issues directly related to the destructive impact of Russian aggression on nature. Combating ecocide is one of the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, and we must implement each of its points, all aspects of peace. The conversation with the President of Guatemala. The Peace Formula, our cooperation with Latin America, assistance in demining, and most importantly, in establishing a Tribunal for Russian aggression. The meeting with our business representatives - very important, very meaningful. I am grateful to them. We discussed how to stimulate economic activity now, in times of war. We talked about how to provide more protection for business, more interaction between the state and business. The first priority now is defense, and this is obvious. But the economy is also important. I am grateful to everyone who works for Ukraine, for Ukrainians, who preserves and creates new jobs, who pays taxes and who is already preparing for our recovery, for the large-scale transformation program of Ukraine that we will definitely implement after our victory. And, of course, our warriors, our defense. Today, in my address to the Chatham House community - one of the world&#x27;s leading British intellectual centers - I told that three more very important decrees have been prepared to award our warriors - 419 warriors. In total, over 49,000 Ukrainians have already been awarded state awards during the full-scale war! I am grateful to each and every one who defends our country! I thank all those who are in combat now, who also gave us the best news today - the advancement of Ukrainian positions. Glory to you, our heroes! I thank everyone in the world who really helps us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine and Ukrainians are much stronger than anyone thinks about us – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-30</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, good health to you! I held a Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff meeting today – a long and very detailed one devoted to several issues. The commanders reported both on the general defense situation, and the specific directions of our defense and our offensive actions. During this day, we also have made progress in all directions of our active actions. We considered the supply of rounds for artillery – for the east, for the south - at the Staff meeting. And although our work with partners to receive rounds for Ukrainian soldiers is already at our best capacity, we will make it even more active. Strengthening our artillery is an obvious priority, and all foreign affairs specialists received additional tasks today. The situation in the north, in particular, on the territory of Belarus, was considered separately. Our intelligence reported today – Defense Intelligence, foreign intelligence, border guards intelligence. The SSU chief reported. We very carefully analyze every fact and any prospects in all directions. By the decision of the Staff, Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny and General Naev were instructed to strengthen the northern direction – to guarantee peace. Appropriate deadlines are set. Today, I thank Denmark and personally Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen for the new defense package for Ukraine. Artillery rounds, air defense missiles, demining equipment... Thank you! I also held several meaningful preparatory meetings today regarding the internal context in our state, relevant internal measures, and international measures – an extremely important period of foreign policy is beginning. The work in order to expand peace through expanding our security capabilities, our alliances and cooperation. The following weeks will be extremely active, and the positions of our state are clearly defined, all our officials know what to do. And one more. Today is the first anniversary of the liberation of Snake Island from the Russian invaders. It is one of our major victories. Remember, last year, in the spring, no one expected from Ukraine that we would be able to implement, in particular, this fundamental defense task – to provide security to Snake Island, and therefore to a significant part of the Black Sea water area. But our soldiers did it. Russian terrorists needed Snake Island to destroy the entire south of our country, our beautiful Odesa and other cities. Our soldiers stopped them and drove them out of Snake Island. Ukraine and Ukrainians are much stronger than anyone thinks about us. Sometimes, stronger than we are used to thinking about ourselves. Thanks to all that our people manage to do in the confrontation with Russian terrorists, we are revealing to the whole world and to ourselves a new Ukrainian strength – a real Ukrainian strength. The strength that we will never lose and that will always be a pillar of the security of the free world. I am grateful to everyone who freed Snake Island! Defense Intelligence, together with other elements of the Defense and Security Forces of our country, conducted this operation. Defense Intelligence and the SSU Alpha special unit, the Naval Forces and the army aviation of the Ground Forces Command, the Air Force aviation and our strong border guards. Thank you! And we will always remember our heroes, our soldiers, who gave their lives for the sake of this Ukrainian victory. Among those whose names can now be mentioned... Defense Intelligence fighters – Ruslan Popov, Hero of Ukraine, captain of the 1st rank; Oleh Zaitsev, Hero of Ukraine, junior lieutenant; Vitaliy Ihnatenko, Hero of Ukraine, soldier. SSU Alpha fighters – Volodymyr Kyseliov, Hero of Ukraine, captain; Oleksandr Krykunenko, Hero of Ukraine, major. Soldiers of the Navy - Ihor Bedzai, Hero of Ukraine, colonel; as well as Mykhailo Zaremba, major; Serhiy Muschytsky, captain; Yuriy Pyroh, staff sergeant. Eternal memory! Eternal memory and glory to all those who gave their lives so that our beautiful Ukraine would live! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>All those who help aggressor to receive response of Ukraine and the whole world – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-01</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! We are ending this day in Rivne region – I held another visiting meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff. Key issues of security in the northern regions of our country, our measures to strengthen security. Everything that concerns the border, our forces of the Pivnich operational-strategic group, and Ukrainian strategic facilities – such as the Rivne nuclear power plant, where the Staff meeting took place. There were reports of intelligence, the Commander-in-Chief, the commander of the Pivnich group, the head of the border guard service, the minister of internal affairs, and the head of Rivne Regional Military Administration on social issues and people&#x27;s needs. There was also a report by Head of Energoatom Kotin, director of the Rivne NPP. In general, not only everything related to the physical security of our strategic facilities and northern regions but also such sensitive issues as cybersecurity were worked out in detail. Thank you to everyone in Rivne region and here, at the Rivne NPP, and along the entire perimeter of our northern border, who cares about the safety of Ukraine and our people. Today, another package of Ukrainian sanctions was published against those who help Russia wage this terrorist war. In particular, sanctions against almost 300 legal entities and almost 200 individuals. And these are not only citizens of Russia. Anyone in the world who helps the aggressor will receive a response from Ukraine and the whole world. Spanish Prime Minister Sánchez paid a visit to Ukraine today. It is very symbolic – on the first day of the beginning of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. This clearly speaks to a new reality. It was always impossible to imagine our common European home as complete without Ukraine. And now we have achieved at the political level that European affairs are no longer considered without Ukraine. This visit of Mr. Prime Minister Sánchez speaks about the priorities of the Spanish presidency and our cooperation. I thank you, Spain, for your support – defense, political, economic! I&#x27;d like to express my special thanks for the respect and help to our people who found refuge in Spain, fleeing the hostilities in Ukraine. I believe soon we will be able to provide all the necessary conditions for our people to return home to Ukraine. By the way, today, we signed a joint statement with Mr. Prime Minister Sánchez regarding support for Ukraine&#x27;s European and Euro-Atlantic prospects, and this is already the 21st such statement, that is, the majority supported our prospects, in particular in the issue of membership in the Alliance... Belgium, Denmark, our friends from Estonia, Italy, Iceland, Spain, Canada, this is Latvia, this is Lithuania, the Netherlands, Germany, this is Norway and Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Finland, France, the Czech Republic, Montenegro, and Sweden. Thanks to all of you! I am also grateful to those states with which we do not yet have such joint signed statements and declarations, but which absolutely clearly support Ukraine on its way to NATO, and therefore support the approach of real peace throughout Europe. Thank you! And one more. Today, there was a message from the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission about the increase in water tariffs. Shameful decision to say the least. Unprofessional. Not agreed with the government. We cannot and will not accept such decisions calmly. The government is instructed to present a solution in response. And they will be. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukrainian shores will never tolerate the occupier - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-02</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I am in Odesa, first and foremost, to congratulate our warriors of the Ukrainian Navy on their professional day. To congratulate them and thank them for their courage, heroism, and the extraordinary results they have achieved and are achieving for Ukraine. It is enough to recall what ambitions Russia had at the beginning of the full-scale aggression and what ambitions are now at the bottom of the Black Sea. I thank every warrior of the Ukrainian Navy - all sailors, all marines, all commanders of our Navy, artillerymen, naval aviators, drone operators, I thank the warriors of the river flotilla, river divisions... I thank you all! Today, I had the honor to award the best, and congratulated the cadets of the Institute of Naval Forces of our Odesa Maritime Academy. I visited the wounded warriors in the hospital. I wish everyone a speedy recovery. It was a special honor for me to leave my wishes on the copy of Kobzar that has been accompanying our warriors in battles since 2014. Today I also heard the report by our Navy Commander, Vice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa, and Commander of the Odesa operational and strategic group of troops, General Moskalov. They spoke about the current security situation and the strategic tasks for our fleet, for the new direction - the fleet of naval drones - and for our coastal defense. We will implement everything! I am sure of it! The enemy will definitely not dictate the conditions in the Black Sea, and the occupiers will have to be as afraid of approaching our Ukrainian Crimea and our Azov Sea coast as Russian ships are already afraid of approaching our Black Sea coast. Today I also congratulate all civilian workers of the Ukrainian sea and river fleet, all those who ensure the security and operation of our ports, our ability to give life to the Ukrainian economy and connect our Ukraine with global markets despite the Russian blockade of the Black Sea. I thank all the sailors, port workers, ship repairers, businesses, employees and, of course, every soldier who protects the security of Ukrainian ports, Ukrainian cities, and Ukrainian shores. We will win together! Ukrainian shores will never tolerate the occupier. Glory to all our defenders! I thank you, Odesa, for this day! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will do everything possible and impossible to make our air defense system the most powerful - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-03</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! First of all, I congratulate our anti-aircraft warriors - the warriors of the anti-aircraft missile troops of the Ukrainian Air Force, who are celebrating their holiday today. I thank you for every target you have shot down, warriors! More than three thousand targets have been shot down: more than 180 aircraft, more than 130 helicopters, nearly 40 ballistic and more than a thousand cruise missiles, more than 1,600 drones of various types... All this means thousands and thousands of lives saved by you, hundreds of critical infrastructure facilities that you have protected. During this war, eight anti-aircraft missile brigades received the honorary award &quot;For Courage and Bravery&quot;. More than 1,100 anti-aircraft warriors received state awards, and eight of them were awarded the highest title - Hero of Ukraine. They are Colonel Serhiy Yaremenko, Lieutenant Colonels Volodymyr Vesnin, Andriy Kruhlov, Serhiy Poberezhets, Artem Sharkov, Dmytro Shumakov, Major Yaroslav Melnyk and Senior Lieutenant Artem Slisarchuk, who was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Unfortunately, our state does not yet have enough high-quality air defense systems to protect our entire territory and shoot down all enemy targets. The enemy is taking advantage of this, as it did today, when it launched another terrorist attack on the city of Sumy with an Iranian drone, hitting residential buildings and the building of the Security Service of Ukraine. As a result of these strikes, there are wounded and killed... My condolences! We will do everything possible and impossible to make our air defense system the most powerful. Today, General Oleshchuk, the commander of the Air Force, reported to me on our actions to strengthen air defense. The goal is for the Ukrainian sky shield to be able to protect our entire territory from Russian terror, and in the future, to become the basis for the European sky shield. This is absolutely necessary and absolutely possible. By the way, I spoke with Mr. Chancellor Scholz today. Germany has helped Ukraine with air defense in a very powerful way. The brilliant German IRIS-T systems have proved to be very effective in protecting our skies. We also have very effective American Patriots, which were given to us by Germany. Ukraine is grateful for them, as well as for the rest of the vital assistance! In today&#x27;s conversation with Mr. Chancellor, we focused, of course, on further defense cooperation, as well as on strategic issues of protecting our Europe - a Europe that can only be peaceful if peace is guaranteed by full security certainty. Europe cannot have a deficit of security certainty that will provoke Russian tyranny and aggression. Russia will try to take a bite out of Europe only when it sees any kind of security uncertainty. When everything is certain and obvious, Russian tyranny does not dare to violate security. It is obvious that Europe can be protected from any aggression only together with Ukraine and only together with Ukraine in NATO. That is why we must achieve security certainty about our future in the Alliance. Then Russia will have to refocus on its own statehood - to finally take care of itself, not some expansions. We are preparing for the Summit very actively, and we expect our partners to be as determined as this historic moment requires. And, of course, our active actions. The frontline. The heroic 35th and 36th separate marine brigades - thank you, warriors! The 47th separate mechanized brigade &quot;Magura&quot; - thank you! The glorious 55th separate artillery brigade &quot;Zaporizhzhia Sich&quot; - thank you, warriors! The 128th separate brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces - thank you! Today, it is worth mentioning Junior Lieutenant Oleksandr Pavlov, platoon commander of the 36th marine brigade. His confident and powerful actions, skillful command in combat bring good results to the state. Thank you! The crew of the T-80 tank under the command of Junior Sergeant Andriy Marchuk - thank you for your accuracy and bravery! This is the 36th marine brigade. And from the 35th brigade, I would like to mention the tank commander, Junior Sergeant Artem Obrazko, for his true Ukrainian courage and skill in liberating Makarivka. Thank you, Artem! Senior Soldier Yevhen Piddubnyi, a sapper from the 47th mechanized brigade. He operates in a very hot area and performs his tasks very effectively. Thank you, Yevhen! Captain Ivan Ohurtsov. Operating in the Avdiivka sector, our artillery fire groups under his command are very effective in destroying enemy positions and depots. Thank you, warrior! Maryinka direction... The artillery division under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Pavlo Lukyanov does not give the occupiers a single minute of rest. Your combat results are really significant! Thank you! I thank everyone who is now in combat, at combat posts and in positions! Thank you to everyone who helps! And one more thing. Today, the world once again saw how the Kremlin - unfortunately, at the hands of the current Georgian government - is killing Ukrainian citizen Mykhailo Saakashvili. Human life is the highest value, and we cannot allow Mykhailo to be simply killed. Ukraine has repeatedly called on the Georgian authorities to stop this demonstrative execution. Both we and our partners have offered various options to save Mykhailo. Today, I have instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to summon the Ambassador of Georgia to Ukraine, to express our protest and to offer him to leave Ukraine within the next 48 hours to hold consultations with his capital. Once again, I call on the Georgian authorities to transfer Ukrainian citizen Mykhailo Saakashvili to Ukraine for the necessary treatment and care. And I urge our partners to address this situation, not to ignore it and save this man. No government in Europe has the right to execute people, life is a basic European value. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world sees that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhia NPP is Russia - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-04</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! I have just finished a conversation with Mr. President of France Macron, and these are the third international negotiations today - after conversations with the NATO Secretary General and the Prime Minister of Sweden. The key is our defense, the frontline, weapons, and the capabilities of our soldiers, and I am grateful to our partners for understanding our needs. We have agreed on new defense packages, and by the way, thank you, Emmanuel, for the fact that today the weapons we had agreed on - missiles and tanks - have begun to arrive. But, of course, today we also talked about more strategic things - about what will be the security foundation of Europe after this war and our victory. For peace to come sooner and to be lasting, fair and real, the Russian evil must see the limit we will set for the Kremlin&#x27;s ambitions. We, all free European nations, all in our Euro-Atlantic community, not Russian terrorists and any of their acts of blackmail and aggression. Every day we are adding content to the NATO Summit that will take place in Vilnius next week, and I am grateful to all our partners who are working with us to strengthen the Alliance and thus to ensure security in Europe - real security. Today, in conversations with the President of France, the Prime Minister of Sweden and the NATO Secretary General, we have coordinated our steps in the run-up to Vilnius. I also held several meetings with government officials and the Office&#x27;s international team to prepare for foreign policy events that will take place in the near future. Very importantly, the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The whole world must now realize that common security depends entirely on global attention to the actions of the occupiers at the plant. Russia must clearly realize that the world sees what scenarios terrorists are preparing for, and the world is ready to respond. Radiation is a threat to everyone in the world, and the nuclear power plant must be fully protected from any radiation incidents. Today, it is exactly 16 months since the Russian troops have been in full control of the territory and facilities of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Different countries have their own intelligence and other capabilities to know exactly what is going on and who is to blame. Now we have information from our intelligence that the Russian troops have placed objects resembling explosives on the roof of several power units of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Perhaps to simulate an attack on the plant. Perhaps they have some other scenario. But in any case, the world sees - can&#x27;t but see - that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Russia and no one else. Unfortunately, there was no timely and large-scale response to the terrorist attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. And this may incite the Kremlin to commit new evil. It is the responsibility of everyone in the world to stop it, no one can stand aside, as radiation affects everyone. I thank Mr. President Macron for his attention to the situation at the ZNPP and for his willingness to do everything necessary to ensure safety. One more thing. Today, Russia once again attacked Kharkiv region, the city of Pervomaiskyi. Presumably, it was an Iskander missile. Eight ordinary high-rise buildings were damaged. More than 40 people were wounded, 12 of them children, 2 of them infants, less than a year old... As of now, rescuers and police are still inspecting the damaged buildings. Everyone who was wounded by this missile strike will be provided with all necessary assistance. And the enemy will be held accountable for this strike, as well as for all their other strikes. Russian terrorists want to become exemplary in the way they destroy life. We will become exemplary in the way we protect life and in the way life then responds - justly and inevitably - to every blow inflicted to every terrorist. The Nazis tried to hide from justice. For a long time. But many of them were found and are still being prosecuted. We will catch the ruscists much faster. By the way, I will now have a meeting with Interior Minister Klymenko and Head of the Security Service Malyuk to discuss new challenges to our security and the overall situation. I also had a meeting with the intelligence today... We know how to put terrorists in their place. I thank all our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are working with our partners as hard as we can to ensure that our common security in Vilnius prevails; it all depends on our partners - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-05</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! A report on this day. First: The meeting of the Staff was particularly long, particularly detailed. We discussed the safety of our strategic facilities, our nuclear power plants. There were relevant reports, relevant decisions, and - very importantly - control over the implementation of decisions. By the way, we maintain maximum contact with our partners to ensure that no one in the world has even the slightest shortage of information about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the threats posed by Russia. As always, we discussed in detail the key areas of the East and South. Thank you, warriors, for your bravery! We are also paying attention to the Northern direction - we see all potential threats, and the Commander-in-Chief has been instructed to continue strengthening the North. Very importantly, at every meeting of the Staff, we return to the issue of ammunition, in particular for our artillery. And this applies not only to supplies from partners, but also to production in Ukraine. I am grateful to each and every person who works to fulfill this strategic, vital task. We are constantly making progress in the production of weapons in Ukraine. The second important thing that happened today. We are preparing new sanctions, sanction steps by our government, and today I held a meeting with First Deputy Prime Minister Svyrydenko and National Security and Defense Council Secretary Danilov. The decisions will be made soon. Third, I held a separate meeting on the situation with shelters in different regions of our country, in different cities. The reports were delivered by Minister of Strategic Industries Kamyshin and specialized Deputy Head of the Office for Regional Policy Kuleba. Unfortunately, in different cities of Ukraine, there is still a significant lack of availability of shelters... after all this time. The state will not tolerate such inaction. And this is the responsibility of local leaders. Local authorities in the country have the resources to build shelters. One more thing. There is exactly one week left until the key day of the NATO Summit in Vilnius. That means a week until the key moment for our common security in Europe. We are working with our partners as hard as we can to ensure that our common security in Vilnius prevails. It all depends on our partners. Glory to all Ukrainian heroes! Glory to each of our combat brigades, all units of our defense and security forces! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No one in the world should be left alone with the enemy of freedom who uses ecocide as his weapon and threatens with radiation catastrophe - President&#x27;s address to the university community of Argentina</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-05</span></div>
  <p>¡Buenos días! Thank you for your kind words about Ukraine and thank you for your attention to our struggle for freedom. Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants! Dear Mr. Rector, Presidium! Dear students! Please remember that everything you have has power and meaning only when you have freedom, and when you act in defense of your freedom. Without freedom, life loses its meaning. A person may exist physically being enslaved, but this definitely cannot be called life. And wherever we are - in any country, on any continent - freedom is valued equally everywhere. Everywhere, freedom either already is or will someday become the highest value. Because it is in the nature of people. You get an education, and it will make you freer than you were before university. You will build a career, and it will make you freer than you will be after university. Anything in a person&#x27;s life can be measured in this way - on a scale of freedom. And it is the same in the life of every country. There is no real life for a country if it is deprived of freedom - if it has been subjugated by military force, political pressure or economic manipulation. And it is always a blessing - even when it is not perceived so much - if a country has true freedom. This Sunday, Argentina will celebrate its Independence Day. Although it is a bit early, I would like to congratulate you on your day from the bottom of my heart and wish you and your country to feel more and more freedom every year. In Ukraine, we will also celebrate our Independence Day in the summer, on August 24, but in completely different circumstances. Unfortunately, we do not yet see any possibility that Russia will stop its brutal colonialist aggression against our country. We need time to drive the occupiers out of all our land and free all our people from enslavement. We never wanted this war. We did not go to the land of any other nation - it was Russia that came to our land, burning our cities, killing and deporting our people. For us, this is a war for freedom, and that is why we are fighting against all odds and will not give up our freedom. But I want you to know that it is not only the fate of Ukrainians that is being decided in this war. Much more is being decided in it. I&#x27;ll give you one example. This night, 5-6 July, it will be exactly one month after one of the most brutal Russian crimes of this war. Exactly one month after the dam and facilities of our Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant were blown up and the Kakhovka reservoir was destroyed. It was one of the largest reservoirs in Europe, and now it is just dry silt. Russia occupied the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant at the beginning of the full-scale war. It had full control over it - every building, dam, absolutely everything. Last year, we warned the world that the occupiers had mined the dam - our intelligence had this information. And unfortunately, it turned out to be true. Russia needed to blow up the dam in order to use this catastrophe... just imagine it!.. to simplify control over part of our occupied territory. Dozens of flooded towns and villages, people killed, nature destroyed... the largest ecocide in Europe in decades, the destruction of the ecological balance in an area of hundreds of thousands of hectares... And what for? Because the occupiers were afraid of our offensive in these areas and wanted to protect their positions in the occupied territory with the mass of water. Imagine the level of cynicism and hatred towards freedom that drives such evil! Imagine if something like this happened, God forbid, to a dam on Paraná or Limay. Now, unfortunately, we face an even greater threat. Around the same time that the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant was occupied, the Russian military occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. A nuclear power plant. The largest in Europe. Six power units. All this time - month after month - Russia has been using the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as a cover for shelling neighboring cities. They place artillery right on the territory of the plant or near it and open fire. Just imagine this... And now they have also mined this nuclear power plant. And this is a fact. Why? Moscow is considering various scenarios, including those similar to the man-made disaster at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, i.e. for cynical military purposes. But we should not even think about which scenario is the most likely. We should only think about how to prevent any disastrous scenario! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear students! No one in the world should be left alone with such an enemy of freedom, who uses even large-scale ecocide as his weapon and threatens with a radiation catastrophe! This is a challenge to the values of any nation, any culture, any country. And if such an enemy of freedom succeeds with his terror anywhere in the world, it will only be a matter of time before the life of the world is destroyed. Different dictatorships can be inspired by the current Russian dictatorship - its cynicism, its malice. Different terrorists can be inspired by today&#x27;s Russian terror - its boundlessness. And any freedom on the planet will be inspired by Ukrainian freedom when we finally drive the Russian invaders out of our land. That is why we need your help so much. The nations and states of Latin America can do so much to protect freedom and the right of every people to freedom! And it does not even require direct intervention in the ongoing war. It is enough to defend freedom. To defend it not only in your own countries for your own people, but also globally, in particular at the level of international institutions, at international summits. And to condemn the enemies of freedom - whoever they are and whatever people they are trying to enslave. And most importantly, we must work together, all nations that respect international law, as your rector said, to ensure that the freedom of nations is not threatened. And this is very important. Just as people in the streets and squares can overthrow any dictatorship in unity, a united world can neutralize any aggressor, any threat to global freedom. But to do this, we must act in defense of freedom! All of us together. Argentina, the whole of Latin America, the whole world. ¡Viva la libertad! I thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Defense support means saving freedom - speech by the President of Ukraine at the meeting with representatives of Bulgarian political circles, civil society and media</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-06</span></div>
  <p>Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Deputy Prime Minister! Dear participants! Dear friends! I&#x27;m sure we have a lot of friends here and it is tangible, so let me address you in this way. First of all, I really want to apologize for our delay - it&#x27;s a fact, all of our conversations here today, all of our conversations in Bulgaria are so important, so meaningful that there is simply not enough time to keep up with this schedule... But I hope that our conversation will also be as meaningful as possible. I know that you have questions and I will be happy, all of us will be happy to answer them. But first, I want to thank everyone in Bulgaria, I want to thank each and every one of you for your respect and support for our people - it is very important - who, after the outbreak of a full-scale war, found refuge in your cities, among you, in your communities. In total, more than one hundred and forty thousand of our people have found protection in Bulgaria since then, and I am very grateful for that. You applauded me and I want you to applaud yourselves for everything you have done for our people. We are trying to do our best to ensure that our people can return home to Ukraine as soon as possible. We want Ukraine to finally become safe, and we feel that this is possible not in the long term, but quite soon... Ukraine&#x27;s victory is real. And we need it very much. It all depends on one factor, namely, the amount and power of the important support we use for defense - first of all, armed support. But it also depends on support through sanctions against Russia for terror, financial support for our social stability in a time like this, a time of war, and, last but not least, motivation for our people. People need to see and feel that the world sees and feels the pain that Ukrainians are going through in order to protect for themselves and their children exactly the same values that every free nation enjoys. It is absolutely fair. You know, among all the disinformation about this war, whether it&#x27;s Russian disinformation or simply narratives that favor Russia, there are some particularly absurd, dangerous claims. And among them is the claim that helping Ukraine, in particular with weapons or sanctions, allegedly makes this war longer and allegedly does not help restore security. You may have heard such absurd statements. It is always important to refute them, because war is a time when any disregard for reality is disheartening and prevents the war from ending. The reality speaks for itself, namely that we were able to significantly reduce the scale of this war. First of all, thanks to the weapons we receive. Our warriors have already liberated about one thousand nine hundred towns and villages on Ukrainian soil since February 24 last year. Indeed, we still have a very, very difficult path to go to liberate our entire territory from occupation, but let&#x27;s not forget how it all began, how it all started, and what Ukrainians have been able to accomplish. We have repelled Russian attacks on our northern regions and the capital of Ukraine. We have liberated large areas of the east and south of our country. We have begun to create a powerful sky shield that can become the basis of a pan-European sky shield, and we have already proven that Russia has no missiles that cannot be shot down. We have destroyed the entire, and I emphasize this, the entire most combat-ready part of the Russian army in battles. Putin is now forced to humiliate himself in front of regimes like Iran to get weapons to continue his terror. Terror against Ukraine. Russia, which claimed to be the second most powerful country in the world, is looking for help from exiles… And this Russian ruler is already so weak that he is unable to protect even Russian regions from his own militants. And if one day someone like Prigozhin or Kadyrov, for example, marches directly to the Kremlin, we should not be surprised. All the remnants of the Russian armed forces are in the occupied areas of our country, and those who are supposed to guarantee the security of this regime in Russia have no motivation to actually fight for a weak and inadequate tsar. So now we have to increase our joint pressure. The more aid, ammunition, and weapons we receive, the more modern they are, the clearer the contours of our victory are, that is, the more the scale of the war on our land is reduced, because we are pushing the occupiers out. Defense support really means saving freedom, it increases the space of freedom and normal life for our people. And I am grateful to you, I am grateful to Bulgaria for being on the bright side of history, particularly in defense cooperation. The greater our political unity is, particularly in the area of European and Euro-Atlantic integration, the more the Russian dictator&#x27;s entourage will fall apart and the weaker he will become. None of his ambitions have been realized. And we have to confirm at every stage of our path that the ambitions of the Russian regime will not be realized. Vilnius is now one of the key stages. It is there that we can and must prove that Russian regimes - whatever they may be - will no longer have a &quot;veto&quot; over the free choice of the European nations to determine their future. Ukraine is choosing the Alliance, NATO&#x27;s door is open, so it is time for an invitation to enter. When Ukraine chooses its future independently, and our choice really works, it means that the whole of Europe chooses and will always choose its future without external coercion. The current Russian regime is the last enslaver of nations in Europe. And this is also a fact. And this regime must lose, both on the battlefield and in politics, so that all people in Europe can win. And the third aspect is unity. This is very important. Modern Europe cannot afford the luxury of internal confrontations and internal divisions. Today is exactly one month since a new government has been in office in Bulgaria, and I sincerely wish this government a solid foundation of social unity, and therefore the opportunity to increase your strength, your influence, and the benefits for Bulgaria - in Europe and around the world. You always have to fight for the future of your people, and to gain it, you need unity, on which you rely. May you succeed! Ukraine will always support you. And it will always be grateful to you for helping our defense. I thank you for your attention! Thank you, beautiful Sofia, and thank you for hosting our delegation, for treating our people as if they were your own, your own family and friends. It&#x27;s so important, it keeps you going. And I am grateful to you for that. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Snake Island. The free island of free Ukraine – address of President on the morning of the 500th day of the war</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-08</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! Today, we are on Snake Island – on our Snake Island, which will never be conquered by the occupier, like the whole of Ukraine because we are a country of the brave. Today, we honored here our Ukrainian heroes – all the soldiers who fought for this island, who liberated it. And although this is a small piece of land in the middle of our Black Sea, it is a great proof that Ukraine will regain every bit of its territory. I want to thank – from here, from this place of victory – each of our soldiers for these 500 days. Our Armed Forces, our intelligence, the National Guard, our border guards, the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, our liaison officers, our people... I thank you! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! And let the freedom that all our heroes of different times wanted for Ukraine and that must be won right now be a tribute to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine. We will definitely win! For sure! Glory to Ukraine! We are moving forward. Thank you to every one!</p>

  <h2>We value every life, remember history and defend freedom together - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-09</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today I am in Lutsk with the team. In the morning I met with Mr. President of Poland Duda. A conversation with him. A prayer service. There were representatives of all denominations and religious communities... In the Lutsk church. Together with Andrzej, we honored the memory of all the victims in Volyn. We value every life, remember history, and defend freedom together. Here in Lutsk, in Lubart&#x27;s castle, I held a long meeting today on the situation in the region - security, the situation on the border, the situation in the border areas of neighboring Belarus... The priority is to reinforce each region, our entire northern border. There were reports from the military, law enforcers, and local authorities. We analyzed the training and supply of our Defense and Security Forces and relevant units in Volyn. There was a report on the social situation in the region, the needs of people. Energy, water supply, budgetary support - both for people and for the social sphere. The state of the shelters. Jobs in the region. The state supports and will continue to support as much as possible. And I am grateful to everyone here in Lutsk, to everyone in other cities and communities of the region where IDPs have been accommodated, where people help in the treatment and rehabilitation of our warriors... Thank you! The frontline, our active actions. This week we have a lot to be grateful for to the warriors of our 3rd separate assault brigade, the 24th separate mechanized brigade, the paratroopers of the &quot;Eightieth&quot;... Well done, warriors! In the Tavria direction, as always, the paratroopers of the &quot;Seventy-Ninth&quot;, the artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade &quot;Zaporizhzhia Sich&quot;, the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion and the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade distinguished themselves with power, courage and accuracy... I want to thank you! I would like to mention a warrior of the Zaporizhzhia Sich brigade, Major Volodymyr Honcharov. Thank you, Volodymyr! Sailor Serhiy Komar - 35th separate marine brigade - thank you, Serhiy! Soldier Oleksiy Labenets, a rifleman of the security battalion of the 15th transport aviation brigade. Thank you, Oleksiy! Artillerymen of the &quot;Magura&quot;, the 47th separate mechanized brigade - Major Anton Cherevko and Senior Lieutenant Vasyl Abramiv. Thank you, guys! Thank you to everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone in the world who helps! Thank you, Lutsk, for this day! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine will be in NATO, we are working on the algorithm of gaining membership - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-10</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! So, Ukraine is on the eve of Vilnius. The NATO Summit, which could be exactly what our country, the entire Alliance, and global security need. We are working extremely hard these days! Even more actively than ever. And although this work is almost one hundred percent behind the scenes, it is no less important than any public work. Everyone understands everything. Every leader, every state. Even if different positions are voiced, it is still clear that Ukraine deserves to be in the Alliance. Not now - there is a war, but we need a clear signal. And we need this signal right now. I am grateful to all the leaders, to every country, who say so and who have adopted the relevant joint declarations and statements with Ukraine on our integration. The majority of the Alliance clearly stands for us. The courage of Ukrainian heroes has wiped away the dust of history from all the values for the protection of which NATO was created. The eastern border of Ukraine, the border of our state and the positions of our warriors are the line that the Russian dictatorship, which in various forms, but always, always tried to conquer the peoples of Europe, will never cross again. The security reality here on NATO&#x27;s eastern flank depends on Ukraine. When we applied to join NATO, we were frank: Ukraine is de facto already in the Alliance. Our weapons are the weapons of the Alliance. Our values are what the Alliance believes in. Our defense is the very element of the formula of Europe that makes it united, free and peaceful. Vilnius must confirm all this. We are still working on the wording, that is, on the specific words of such confirmation, but we already understand the fact that Ukraine will be in the Alliance, and we are working to make the algorithm for gaining membership as clear and fast as possible. Our work for this - the work of the entire Ukrainian team - will continue each and every minute of these days. It is also very important that bilateral meetings of various levels are planned in Vilnius - European countries, America, Canada, Japan... The priorities are absolutely clear: air defense for our cities, for all communities throughout the country, we are working to create a full-fledged sky shield. Also weapons for the frontline - we will hold talks in Vilnius on this as well. Of course, we will also talk about other aspects of protecting life and our common security. I am sure that there may be good weaponry-related news for our warriors from Vilnius. Separately, the frontline. Tomorrow, on the day of the opening of the summit, which is now unimaginable without Ukraine, will be the 503rd day of a full-scale war. This says a lot about our strength - the strength of the Ukrainian people, who, in the face of such a war, after so many battles and days, has the strength without which the security of Europe is simply impossible to imagine already. I thank you, Ukrainian warriors, for this strength! I thank every soldier, sailor, sergeant, foreman, officer, and general! I thank everyone who trains our warriors! I thank every volunteer! I thank the doctors who help after the wounds! I thank all our people who work for the sake of Ukrainian strength and Ukrainian victory! It is an honor for me to represent such people and such Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>For the first time since independence, we have formed the foundation of security for Ukraine on its way to NATO - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-12</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We are returning home with a good result for our country, and very importantly, for our warriors. A good reinforcement with weapons. This includes air defense, missiles, armored vehicles and artillery. It is very important: for the first time since independence, we have formed a security foundation for Ukraine on its way to NATO. These are concrete security guarantees that are confirmed by the top 7 democracies in the world. Never before have we had such a security foundation, and this is the level of the G7. On this foundation, we will build a new, legally binding architecture of bilateral security treaties with the most powerful countries. Very importantly, during these two days of the Summit, we have put to rest any doubts and ambiguities about whether Ukraine will be in NATO. It will! For the first time, not only do all Allies agree on this, but a significant majority in the Alliance is vigorously pushing for it. Never before have the words &quot;you are equal among equals&quot; for Ukraine from other NATO members sounded truly meaningful. Now everyone understands that this is a fact. Equal among equals. And we will definitely reaffirm this fact with our victory. And with our accession to NATO. Previously, Russia&#x27;s rulers wanted to have their own fence in front of NATO&#x27;s door. We have left this Russian ambition on the margins of European history - behind the fence of our unity in Europe and, more broadly, in the free world. I am grateful to all those who have worked for unity in Vilnius now! I thank Mr. President Biden and the whole of America for showing that global freedom really does rely on American leadership. We are equally committed to a robust defense of freedom and work together with America to achieve this. I thank Lithuania for organizing this Summit, it is truly historic for all of us... The countdown to a new security. Thank you for every Ukrainian flag on Lithuanian streets - and there were really many flags. And thank you, Vilnius, for the emotions! It is important that Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Albania, Iceland, and representatives of other countries emphasized that Russia and Russian war criminals must be punished fairly for what they have done against Ukraine. Aggression must be punished. I am grateful to the countries and leaders who are preparing to start training our pilots on F16 jets in a few weeks... I thank the Netherlands! Thank you for your extremely important leadership in Europe. Denmark, thank you! Thank you for your very specific support! The United Kingdom... Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister, I thank you for your help and for stating that we have to take the next step at the next NATO Summit. Ukraine is already among the equals in the Alliance and should be a real part of the Alliance. France and Mr. President Macron... I thank you for your readiness to do everything necessary to liberate our entire territory from the occupiers. Thank you for supporting, together with America and Germany, the long-term programs of our common strength. Olaf, Mr. Chancellor, it is very important to see Germany among our allies. All Ukrainians are grateful to you for the additional Patriots and missiles for them. This is the defense of life, and Germany has already saved thousands of lives. I thank you for your willingness to support us until we defeat the Russian terror. Italy... I am grateful to the Italians, personally to Prime Minister Meloni, for the principled position. Every Ukrainian family has something to thank Italian security assistance for. There will be a new security package. And it is very important that Italy fully supports the Peace Formula. Canada... Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau said that Canada will do everything to ensure that Ukraine&#x27;s membership in NATO is achieved as soon as possible. Thank you! Poland&#x27;s principled position... That our membership in the Alliance is not only our security, it is the security of our entire region, at least. And it is very important that Poland supports Ukraine on its way to the Alliance - strongly, vigorously. Thank you! Mr. President Erdoğan and Türkiye... He said today that he really sees Ukraine moving closer to membership in the Alliance. This means a lot. I thank you! Thank you also for the principled defense of security in the Black Sea... Türkiye is doing historic things for all of us. President Erdoğan and the Prime Minister of Norway spoke today about reconstruction... The clarity of the partners&#x27; commitments is extremely important. Thank you for that! I thank Norway for its tangible leadership, for all the support that has already been provided... Now there is Norway&#x27;s readiness to join the G7 in guaranteeing security for Ukraine on its way to NATO as well. I am very grateful! Portugal, Sweden, and the Netherlands also expressed their readiness to join the security guarantees for Ukraine... Thank you! We will make this system truly extensive and effective. Mr. President of Romania... Thank you for your work on the pilot training hub. Thank you for supporting our cooperation on the Danube and in the Black Sea. Thank you for your extremely kind and honorable words about our warriors and the entire Ukrainian people. Greece is also joining the long-term support of Ukraine. I am grateful for this! Montenegro, thank you for choosing security and freedom for all in Europe, thank you for your defense support! Spain will continue and increase the treatment and rehabilitation programs for our warriors and veterans. I thank you for your help in this very sensitive issue! Bulgaria is preparing a new security assistance package and I am sure it will work very vigorously with everyone in the NATO-Ukraine Council. Thank you! Slovakia and Mrs. President personally... Thank you for your sincere help and for making your country one of the European leaders in protecting our fundamental values. Latvia, thank you for your faith in Ukraine and for your tangible defense support! Estonia, thank you for your initiative on munitions, which really strengthens and changes the history of Europe for the better and brings peace closer. Thank you also for your political support at the Summit. Luxembourg, invariably principled. Thank you very much! The Czech Republic, thank you for all the weapons, and for the equipment, thank you for the helicopters... There will be a new defense package. Albania, as clearly as possible: Ukraine will be in NATO, and Russia will be held accountable for its aggression. As Prime Minister Rama aptly said today, the Kremlin&#x27;s policy resembles Russia&#x27;s anthem: The words are different, but the music is the same. The threat is the same. NATO is the response. Belgium - thank you for your principled position on the issue of reparations from Russia and for your clear support for the fact that Ukraine is at the table with everyone else in NATO. North Macedonia, thank you for your clear support for Ukraine&#x27;s contribution to common security! Finland, I thank you for your help and thank you for your very important words today that Ukrainian soldiers will soon be sharing their experience with the armies of other NATO members. It is true. The experience of winners is always powerful. And Hungary... It was such a Summit where everyone was quite constructive. Thank you! I would like to thank Mr. Charles Michel, President of the European Council, Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. As always, they are pro-European, and therefore pro-Ukrainian. Of course, Australia and Japan as security guarantors - thank you! I am grateful that peace and justice have become closer today, and Ukraine has become stronger. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Six states have already joined the G7 countries with which we agreed on security guarantees for Ukraine yesterday - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-13</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on this day. First. A meeting with Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Malyuk. A meeting with the heads of intelligence: Main Intelligence Directorate - Budanov, foreign intelligence - Lytvynenko. We analyze the situation very carefully - everything related to the war and everything important for internal security. Second. A meeting with the international relations experts. The Government, the Office. We are already starting to prepare for the next NATO Summit in Washington. At the Vilnius Summit, we have reached good agreements for Ukraine with almost all partners. We had a very good meeting with President Biden and his team: Secretary of Defense Austin and National Security Advisor Sullivan. With everyone in the G7, and we managed to meet with many partners in NATO. Now it is time to turn each such agreement into a concrete result. We have the NATO-Ukraine Council, and this format should work in a meaningful way. We are preparing proposals for our partners. There are new agreements on weapons, on equipment, on aviation, and we are now specifying them. Today we also discussed the preparation of the Crimea Platform. We continue our very successful agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine on its way to NATO by preparing treaties with countries. Bilateral treaties. Only a day after Vilnius, six countries have already joined the seven largest democracies of the world with which we agreed on security guarantees yesterday: the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden. Thank you! I am confident that the number of guarantors will increase. Ukraine and the United States will keep a list of states that will join our joint declaration with the G7 on security guarantees on the path to NATO. During the time period before the Washington Summit, we have to elaborate with our partners everything we discussed in Vilnius and form new common positions that Ukraine and our warriors clearly deserve. I spoke today with President of the Republic of South Africa Ramaphosa. We do not lose focus on the Peace Formula and everything that is needed to implement the Formula for a single day. I invited Mr. President to join our &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; humanitarian initiative. We equally see the need to continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative. It is very important that there are no threats to food security anywhere in the world. And Russia must clearly realize that anyone who increases the threat of famine, particularly in critical regions of Africa, is terrorizing the whole world with hunger, not just a single nation. Recently, representatives of presidents and foreign policy and national security advisors met in the Danish capital. Different countries. The meeting was dedicated to the Peace Formula and the preparation of the Global Peace Summit. I am grateful that the meeting was attended by a representative of the Republic of South Africa. We are already preparing for the next such meeting. And, of course, I would like to thank each and every one of our warriors, all Ukrainian defenders. These days in Vilnius, at the NATO Summit, in the margins of the NATO Summit, at all the meetings, Ukraine enjoyed - and still enjoys - the greatest respect and support from our partners in all the years of our independence. Respect is always a derivative of courage, and attention to any country is always a consequence of the capabilities of that country. Ukraine is in the center of our partners&#x27; attention. No longer Russia, as it was decades ago. And when we put an end to this war by establishing Russia&#x27;s defeat, respect and attention to Ukraine will be forever established in history - for all future generations of our people. But this is being achieved now, in battles for Ukraine, in offense and defense. I thank everyone who is in combat, at combat posts and on combat missions! I thank everyone who defends our skies and who moves our positions on the ground forward. I thank everyone who works to ensure that our warriors have everything they need! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every thousand meters of advancement, every success of each of our combat brigades deserves gratitude - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-14</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today&#x27;s key points. I held a very detailed meeting of the Staff, focused primarily on the frontline. The situation in all key areas of action - both defense against Russian assaults and our active steps forward. Plus everything that is important for this. Shells, weapons, equipment. The rational use of shells, supplies from partners and our own Ukrainian production. Logistics. As always at the Staff, there were reports from our commanders: The Commander-in-Chief, the commanders of operational directions... Zaluzhny, Syrsky, Tarnavsky... Commanders from specific areas of the frontline. And also Minister of Internal Affairs Klymenko. Head of the Border Guard Service Deyneko. There was an important report by Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov on the situation in Belarus - we are closely monitoring what is happening there in terms of security. As of today, there are no large-scale threats. Our full focus is on the frontline. We must all understand very clearly - as clearly as possible - that the Russian forces on our southern and eastern lands are investing everything they can to stop our warriors. And every thousand meters of advance, every success of each of our combat brigades deserves gratitude. Everyone who goes on the offensive, everyone who repels enemy attacks, are doing a great job, and I am grateful to each of our warriors! This week we have not yet finished the planned international work. There will be important negotiations for Ukraine. And we are already preparing for the coming weeks. We will not reduce our international activity for a single day, in particular with regard to the Peace Formula, security guarantees for Ukraine on its way to NATO, and agreements with partners on weapons for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. We are also preparing new NSDC decisions on sanctions. I continue meetings on the transformation of Ukraine. Today it concerned military education. All the experience of our warriors, all the competencies acquired by Ukrainians in the war, our new defense experience shared with our partners - all this must be integrated into the updated Ukrainian military education. It is clear that this industry at the state level deserves a significant upgrade. And it is very important that those who are actually defending our country and are already training our country&#x27;s defenders be involved in the discussion of such an upgrade. And one more thing. Today, I took part in a conversation in America - at a conference with the heads of the largest and most promising global companies and major philanthropists. Investments, jobs in Ukraine, support for our country and people... Ukrainians have now realized the enormous potential of our country. All of it is aimed at our defense. But when we end the war, Ukrainian potential must be invested in Ukrainian development. The world is waiting with great interest to see what this development will be like, what the victorious Ukraine will bring to the world. And this is a question for everyone in Ukraine who works for the state, who plans to work for the state... everyone should ask themselves this question now. And find answers. Ukraine has become a global force. And it should become a force for global development. I am confident that it will. Glory to all those who are fighting for Ukraine! I thank everyone who defends our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We cannot leave any city and village under Russian occupation, where violence and humiliation of people reign – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-15</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! Today, the President and First Lady of the Republic of Korea are visiting our country. A very important visit, a very important direction of our international work. And this is the first visit of the President of the Republic of Korea to Ukraine for the entire period of relations between our states. Now, when the speed of ending the war directly depends on global support for Ukraine, we are doing everything possible to ensure that such support is as intensive and meaningful as possible. In 15 days of July, we&#x27;ve already held negotiations, meetings, events with the leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Türkiye, the Czech Republic, and Poland. Also Slovakia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Sweden, Portugal, Spain and Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa, Guinea-Bissau. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, President of the European Council Michel, President of the European Commission von der Leyen, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. The address to the student community in Argentina, talks with the largest and most promising American investors and company executives. Today, very meaningfully, Mr. President of the Republic of Korea. And we will maintain the highest tempo of international work at all levels to restore peace for all our land and all our people. One of the most terrible things that war brings is separation... We cannot leave any of our people, any towns and villages under Russian occupation. Wherever the Russian occupation continues, violence and humiliation of people reign. I am grateful to all our partners – every leader, every politician, public figure, every country who really supports us in the fact that only the complete liberation of our entire Ukrainian territory will allow the full force of the international rules-based order to be restored. And of course, my thank you to all our warriors. Those weeks on the front lines were very important. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades. Gunners of the 55th separate brigade Zaporizka Sich. The Magura 47th separate mechanized brigade. Paratroopers of the 79th brigade. The third separate assault brigade. The fifth separate assault brigade. The 80th separate brigade of the airborne assault troops. The 57th separate motorized infantry brigade. I thank all of you! All of you guys, you are great! All those who bravely, firmly, and strongly fight for the sake of Ukraine! Ukraine will prevail for sure! Glory to you, warriors! Glory to all who fight and work for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The security of our continent begins with the sovereignty and strength of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-16</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today we celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine. The 33rd of many, many such anniversaries that Ukraine has yet to celebrate. A free Ukraine. Our country will never give up its sovereignty. This is already obvious to everyone in the world. And whatever the Russian terror may be, we know that Ukrainian freedom will still be preserved and will still prevail. Every year, Ukraine will only get stronger and help other free nations to protect their sovereignty and build common security. Ukraine can do this. It can because the lines and words of our fundamental state documents are backed by the strength and determination of our people. Millions of Ukrainians for whom the freedom of our state is their personal freedom. Honoring Ukrainian freedom, Ukrainian sovereignty, and Ukrainian strength, we always honor our heroes. Different people who fought and are still fighting for Ukraine and to whom we owe our freedom. Today, I would like to pay special tribute to the warriors who have shown maximum courage and efficiency for the sake of Ukraine these days and weeks. Soldier Oleksandr Shulha, a mechanic driver of a tank battalion of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade. Thank you, Oleksandr, for your bravery and for saving the lives of the crew!

Sergeant Oleksandr Olivko, the 3rd separate assault brigade, commander of a machine gun squad. Thank you for your courage and accuracy, Oleksandr! Junior Sergeant Vladyslav Datskyi - also from the 3rd separate assault brigade, chief sergeant of an assault platoon. Thank you for your strength, Vladyslav!

Senior Soldier Maksym Shevtsov, Soldier Andriy Khmilevsky, and Junior Sergeant Bohdan Maksymov. All three are warriors of our glorious &quot;Eightieth&quot; - the 80th separate airborne assault brigade. I thank you, warriors! Senior Lieutenant Yevhen Martsynenko and Soldier Oleksandr Dudun - warriors of Kish Otaman Kost Hordiienko 57th separate motorized infantry brigade. I thank you guys! Thank you for Ukrainian strength! Senior Lieutenant Oleh Spichak and Junior Sergeant Serhiy Sargsyan - warriors of the 123rd separate territorial defense brigade. Thank you for your daily bravery, daily military ingenuity in countering Russian subversive reconnaissance groups! Captain-Lieutenant Mykola Sopko and Petty Officer Second Class Serhiy Tarasov - warriors of the 73rd naval special operations center. Thank you for your very significant combat results! Everyone&#x27;s contribution is always valuable in the fight for freedom. Ukraine is proud of its heroes! Ukraine is proud of you! Glory to you, warriors! And, of course, I thank all the warriors of the Air Force of Ukraine - pilots, anti-aircraft gunners, and fighters of mobile fire groups. To everyone who protects the Ukrainian skies. Thank you for every downed Russian missile! We have already shown that there are no Russian missiles that cannot be shot down by Ukrainians. And when the Ukrainian sky shield is powerful enough - and it will be! - Ukraine will ensure real freedom and security for the whole of Europe from Russian terror. The security of our continent begins here with Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and strength. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine, UN and Türkiye can jointly ensure operation of food corridor and inspection of vessels – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! First. Today, I held a conference call – substantive reports. Front, security, supply of rounds. Commanders, SSU chief, intelligence chiefs – defense and foreign intelligence, minister of internal affairs, Defense Ministry. We do everything in detail and every day so that our soldiers have everything they need for active operations. Second. I thank each of our rescuers, each policeman, each volunteer, and each doctor who save our people after Russian shelling. Today&#x27;s terrorist attacks on Sumy region, Kharkiv region, Donbas, Kherson region, and Zaporizhzhia will not go unanswered by our soldiers for sure. Third. Food security. We are preparing a conversation with Mr. UN Secretary General... Ukraine&#x27;s position has always been and will be as clear as possible – no one has the right to destroy the food security of any nation. If a bunch of people somewhere in the Kremlin think that they supposedly have the right to decide whether food will be on the table in different countries: Egypt or Sudan, Yemen or Bangladesh, China or India, Türkiye or Indonesia... then the world has an opportunity to show that blackmail is not allowed to anyone. From the first day of the full-scale aggression, Russia destroyed navigation freedom in the Black and Azov seas. Russia hit our ports, grain terminals with missiles and drones, and even granaries were hit... The only possible consequence of this is the destabilization of food markets and social chaos in the countries critically dependent on food imports. Ukrainian food is basic security for four hundred million people... Last year, the world took the right action regarding the Russian threat to food security – together with Türkiye and the UN, we launched the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Its results are eloquent – almost 33 million tonnes of agricultural products were exported to 45 countries. Sixty percent of the volumes went to the countries of Africa and Asia, in particular, these are Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan... They also were sent to China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen... And it is very important – our food export allows saving lives in the countries, as I said, like Yemen and Somalia... different people... of different religions, different ethnic origins... But they all have the same right to life! In addition to export, we also launched the Grain from Ukraine humanitarian initiative. Thirty-four donor states joined it. And I thank every donor who helped save people from starvation, primarily in African countries. Everyone has a right to stability… Africa has the right to stability. Asia has the right to stability. Europe has every right to stability. And therefore, we must all care about security – about protection from Russian madness. And the Black Sea Grain Initiative can and should keep operating – if without Russia, then without Russia. The agreement on the export of grain – this is an agreement with Türkiye and the UN – remains valid. The only thing that is needed now is its careful implementation – and decisive pressure from the world on the terrorist state. I have sent official letters to President of Türkiye Erdoğan and UN Secretary General Guterres with a proposal to continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative or its analog in a trilateral format – as it is best. Ukraine, the UN and Türkiye can jointly ensure the operation of the food corridor and the inspection of vessels. It is necessary for everyone in the world – and everyone who supports it will become a savior of life in a huge territory from Morocco to China, from Indonesia to Lebanon. One more. I want to especially thank Sweden. Our Swedish friends have approved a strategy to help Ukraine, in particular with reconstruction... a strategy until 2027. This is very important – signals of long-term support. Support for life, restoration of life, support for the fact that Russian terror will clearly lose. Mr. Prime Minister Kristersson, the entire Government of Sweden, everyone in Sweden – I thank you very much! Glory to everyone who helps us defend ourselves from Russian terror! Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Punishing Russia for terror is a historic task for the current generation of world leaders – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-18</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on this day. I held a meeting of the Staff. The main issues are the protection of our ports and the continuation of food exports by sea. This is a strategically important issue, and not only for our country. Last year, thanks to our Black Sea Grain Initiative, we managed to prevent a price crisis on the global food market. A price spike would inevitably have been followed by political and migrant crises, particularly in African and Asian countries. Obviously, the Russian leadership is now trying to provoke these crises. Without our exports, the deficit in the global market will, unfortunately, be very tangible. And not only for the poorest countries. Different countries will feel it: from Libya and Egypt to Bangladesh and China. We are working with our partners to prevent this. For our part, we are developing options for action and agreements to preserve Ukraine&#x27;s global role as a guarantor of food security, our maritime access to the global market, and jobs for Ukrainians in ports and in the agricultural industry. We are fighting for both global security and our Ukrainian farmers. By the way, recently, I met with representatives of African media – newspapers, radio, television – from South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Benin, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. They were not only in Kyiv, but also in Kherson region and Bucha, where they talked to the families of the victims of this war. Every time journalists from other countries come to Ukraine and see the consequences of Russian aggression with their own eyes, they return home with the truth about this war. And we speak with them during interviews not in English or French, we speak the language of truth, and this helps us a lot to keep and increase the world&#x27;s attention to Ukraine, to our struggle for freedom. We talked to African media, among other things, about the situation with grain exports and Russian aggression against global food stability. And I am grateful to everyone in the world media who honestly tells their audience what they see in our region, in our country. Of course, there were reports from the military, intelligence, the Security Service, and the Interior Ministry. The issues are clear – the situation on the frontline, all the hot areas – from Kupyansk to Kherson region, Donetsk region, southern areas of Zaporizhzhia region. We discussed the supply of ammunition and protection from Russian missile and drone strikes. I would like to thank our Air Force and all the defenders of the sky from other branches and types of military forces. I am grateful for every downed Russian missile, for every downed Shahed, for saving the lives of our people and infrastructure, particularly in Odesa and the region. I am especially grateful to the 160th Odesa and 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, the 302nd Kharkiv anti-aircraft missile regiment and the warriors of the 14th Bohdan Khmelnytskyi radio engineering brigade for timely target detection. Thank you! And every fact of using components from the countries of the free world to produce weapons for Russian terrorists, in particular, missiles and Shaheds... Every such fact will be our argument that the existing sanctions and pressure against Russia are not enough. The world must limit trade relations with a terrorist state to such an extent that no component from the free world can be used for terror. Today I held an important meeting on the spiritual independence of Ukraine, our further steps to protect the rights and legitimate interests of Ukrainian citizens in the field of religious relations. There will be news soon. We continue working on the preparation of the Doctrine of Ukraine, on our post-war transformation and on today&#x27;s decisions to help our people. The Minister of Health and the Minister of Social Policy presented the concept of creating a network of rehabilitation centers in Ukraine to me. Different levels and functionality, but absolutely necessary rehabilitation services. The implementation has already begun. The ministers will present all the details. I met with the President of the Japan International Cooperation Agency. This is one of the world&#x27;s largest institutions supporting economic and social development. Its work is similar to that of, for example, USAID, which is already known in Ukraine. The Japanese agency is currently implementing an emergency recovery program in Ukraine, and the program is worth half a billion dollars. In general, since the beginning of the full-scale aggression, this Japanese agency has already provided more than a billion dollars in support to Ukraine. And we have the potential to increase cooperation - this is exactly what we talked about: demining, energy, infrastructure projects, education. Importantly, the construction of rehabilitation centers to overcome the consequences of the war. And one more thing. I signed decrees on awarding our warriors. Seven decrees. A total of 1255 warriors. Combat brigades and units. Different parts of the front. The same supreme bravery! Since February 24, almost 51 thousand Ukrainian warriors have received state awards. I thank everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to all our heroes! To everyone who fights for Ukraine, who trains our warriors, who heals and helps them recover after wounds! Thank you to everyone in the world who helps! And thank you to all our partners for today&#x27;s Ramstein, and especially to U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin for his very clear, unambiguous and powerful statements. Overcoming Russian aggression and punishing Russia for terror is a historic task for the current generation of world leaders. And the world will fulfill this task. Ukraine will win! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russian terror affects everyone; everyone in the world should be interested in bringing Russia to justice – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-19</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Throughout the day, maximum attention was paid to eliminating the consequences of the Russian terrorists&#x27; attack on Odesa, on communities in the region, on Chornomorsk, on our ports. This was perhaps the largest attempt by Russia to inflict pain on Odesa in the entire period of full-scale war. Thanks to the air defense and all our defenders of the sky, the consequences of this strike are still less than they could have been. With each such strike, we appeal to our partners again and again: Ukraine&#x27;s sky shield needs to be strengthened. This attack proves that their target is not only Ukraine, and not only the lives of our people. About a million tons of food is stored in the ports that were attacked today. This is the volume that should have been delivered to consumer countries in Africa and Asia long ago. The port terminal that suffered the most from the Russian terror last night had 60,000 tons of agricultural products stored in it, which were intended to be shipped to China. That is, everyone is affected by this Russian terror. Everyone in the world should be interested in bringing Russia to justice for its terror. I am grateful to all our warriors who protect our country from such attacks. I am grateful to all the rescuers, medical workers, employees of public utilities, local authorities, and volunteers who help our people overcome the consequences of terror. Odesa, Kherson, Zhytomyr, and Kirovohrad regions. Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. Everywhere where there was shelling, missile and drone strikes. I want to thank each and every person who helps save lives! This morning, the military, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, other government officials, and the specialized Deputy Head of the Office for Regional Policy reported to me on the conference call. In the communities affected by last night&#x27;s strikes, initial repairs have already begun. Today I held negotiations with the Taoiseach of Ireland, who was on a visit to Ukraine. Ireland is one of our most vigorous partners in Europe. Although the country is neutral, the Irish do not remain neutral to moral challenges. In the face of such aggression, they are clearly on the bright side of history: they are helping us politically, in security issues, economically, and with sanctions. Humanitarian support is very important. Today we have discussed our further joint steps, in particular, those related to the Peace Formula and the Global Peace Summit. I am grateful to Ireland for supporting our position on the grain initiative. I also met with Samantha Power, head of USAID, the United States Agency for International Development. The day before, she was in Odesa and absolutely understands the importance of our ports for the world&#x27;s food security and the Russian threat to global stability. Today we discussed in detail the possibilities of protecting our infrastructure and our global role. And it is very important that USAID is ready to continue working with Ukraine to support economic activity in our country, develop enterprises, and maintain jobs. I am grateful for this support! And one more thing. We are already actively preparing for international events scheduled for August and September. In particular, today I held a large meeting on the preparation of the Crimea Platform Summit at the level of state leaders and parliamentary level. We know for sure that the Summit will be meaningful and Crimea will become even closer to returning to the free world, even closer to liberation from occupation. All Ukrainian land and all Ukrainian people must be free. Glory to all those who fight for Ukraine and freedom! I thank everyone in the world who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>People should feel that budget resources are used fairly and properly - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>

  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! First, I would like to thank everyone who helps our people and our cities overcome the consequences of Russian strikes. Odesa and the region, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Zhytomyr region, Kharkiv... border regions, Donetsk region… I thank all the rescuers, doctors, nurses, volunteers, police, local authorities... I thank everyone who works for the sake of people and Ukraine. The victims of Russian strikes are being provided with the necessary assistance. Again and again, I thank the employees of our ports and transport infrastructure in general who are doing everything to preserve Ukraine&#x27;s export potential and our access to the global economy. In just four days of this week, since Monday, Russian terrorists have already used almost 70 missiles of various types, almost 90 &quot;Shaheds&quot; against our state, and to a significant extent - against Odesa and Odesa region, Mykolaiv, our other southern cities and communities. Of course, our warriors managed to shoot down some of the enemy missiles and drones, and I thank each of our defenders of the sky for this... But unfortunately, the capacity of Ukrainian air defense is not yet enough to protect the entire Ukrainian sky... We are working with our partners as actively as possible to obtain additional air defense systems that can provide peace and security to our Odesa and all other cities and communities of our country. Today I would like to thank several states that have tightened sanctions against Russian entities, various entities that in one way or another help Russia wage this inhuman aggression. I thank the United States, Canada, and the European Union. Hundreds of new sanctions objectives have been successfully implemented. Russia and everyone in this world who dares to help terrorists must feel the ever-increasing sanctions pressure - whether they are individuals, companies or countries. Today, the National Bank of Ukraine has made an important decision regarding the financial institution operating in our country and owned by Russian oligarchs – they are under sanctions in various jurisdictions... The NSDC sanctions were applied. And now it will be right for the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to immediately consider the relevant proposals of the National Bank of Ukraine and support them in relation to this financial institution. In the interests of depositors, for the sake of financial stability and basic justice. Today, I also spoke with Prime Minister Shmyhal about another issue that should be considered, in particular, through the prism of justice. Budget expenditures. In times of war like this, the maximum state attention, and therefore state resources, should be spent on defense. This is an obvious thing. And every project that can be implemented at the expense of extra-budgetary resources should be implemented at the expense of extra-budgetary resources. This applies to various areas, including culture. Museums, cultural centers, symbols, TV series - all of this is important, but now there are other priorities. Find extra-budgetary funds. Not state funds. So, I suggested two steps to the Prime Minister. The first is to find extra-budgetary funds for projects that are really needed now. There are people in the world who can help. Second, I asked the Prime Minister to consider replacing the Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine. I would also like to appeal to all local authorities in our country: people should feel that budget resources are used fairly and properly. Everyone understands what we are talking about. Paving stones, city decorations, and fountains can wait till after the victory. And one more thing. We continue our work to mobilize the world to protect food security and normal life. Today, for the first time in the history of relations between our countries, I spoke with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, in particular, about Russia&#x27;s attempt to destroy our grain exports. Today, about 20 million people in Ethiopia are on the verge of famine. This is one of the most critical situations in the world. Last year, Ukrainian exports saved the lives of at least one million Ethiopians - that&#x27;s how much food we managed to send to this country, almost 300 thousand tons. And if it wasn&#x27;t for the Russian aggression, we could have saved many more lives and provided much more security. I am confident that this year we can do it - all together, the whole world. No one in the world is interested in allowing Russia to destroy the global food market. And by the way, we have already started preparing for the UN Security Council meeting scheduled for tomorrow, which is dedicated to this very issue, food security. I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps! Glory to our warriors! Glory to everyone who fights for freedom and human lives! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Since start of week, over 20 people have suffered from Russian terror in Odesa region alone; only absolute evil can inflict such blows – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-21</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Russia killed two more children today. Russian artillery attack on the village of Druzhba, Toretsk community, Donetsk region. A girl born in 2007 and a boy born in 2013 died. Chernihiv Region, the village of Honcharivske – a missile hit. Two women were killed, the demolition of the rubble is underway... A cultural center, a school, residential buildings were damaged. My condolences to the relatives and friends of the deceased! Today, Russian missiles and drones hit Odesa and our southern regions again. In total, since the start of the week, over 20 people have suffered from Russian terror in Odesa region alone. Among them are two children. Only absolute evil can inflict such blows. There will be an answer. In addition, there will be even more consolidation of the world for defense and for joint action, even more energy for victory, even more desire for justice, the just punishment of Russia for all the crimes of this war. And this punishment will be. I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff. It was long. The issue of protecting our cities and communities, our ports from Russian attacks was analyzed in detail. If someone in Russia hopes they can turn the Black Sea into a space of arbitrariness and terrorism, they will not succeed. We know how to defend ourselves, and we see the readiness of the world to work together in the future – and more actively – to give peace to this region. Tonight, I plan to hold talks with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. The Black Sea region, food security, other important topics. As always, there were detailed reports of the military, intelligence, and border guards on the current situation on the front line at the Staff meeting. And not only in the key directions of active actions, but also in general regarding the border, regarding the likely development of the situation. The provision of ammunition is a topic of constant attention. Of course, our production of rounds and drones, and not only supplies from partners. Every week we record greater results, the growth of our capabilities. Today, I held a substantial meeting regarding one of the most important components of Ukraine&#x27;s state policy – the policy for heroes. The policy regarding our soldiers, regarding veterans. Ukraine will not only win this war, but also win a life that will be worthy of the heroes who fight for it. It is very important that our system – state, social, economic, and cultural – is exactly such that it can be said that it is truly based on respect. With respect to Ukraine and everyone who directed their lives, their bravery, their strength for the sake of Ukraine resisting evil and defeating Russian terror. I am grateful to everyone who has already started to work out with us the details of the Ukrainian transformation after this war. And one more. I thank our warriors. Everyone who defends the Ukrainian sky throughout the country. The Air Force, our pilots, and anti-aircraft fighters, mobile fire brigades. Each air defense unit of all branches and types of troops. Thank you! Bakhmut direction... The 5th Separate Assault Brigade, the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade. Thank you, warriors, for your courage and ability to hit the enemy so that even the enemy – if he survives – understands that Ukraine will always be free! The 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade Zakarpattia, marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, artillerymen of the 55th Brigade, the 79th Separate Air Assault Brigade, and the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade. Thank you, warriors, for your accuracy, for your ability allowing Ukraine to return its own! Glory to you all, warriors! Glory to everyone who fights for our state and people! Thanks to everyone in the world who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Inspection of &quot;military commissariats&quot; continues: responsibility for violation is inevitable – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! Report for this day. First. Law enforcement officers informed me today about the situation with the former military commissar in Odesa. He was notified of suspicion based on the facts of illegal enrichment and violation of the order of military service. Logically, this story was not supposed to end with just the dismissal. The State Bureau of Investigation, the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office continue the necessary investigative and procedural actions. All details that can be made public will be presented to the public by law enforcement officers. And in general, the inspection of territorial recruitment centers, i.e. &quot;military commissariats&quot;, continues. And every such &quot;cabinet&quot; violation somewhere in the military hierarchy, any attempt to somehow get rich there humiliates our warriors, our heroes. Liability for violations is inevitable. Second. Today, the procedure regarding one of the systemic banks, which belonged to Russian oligarchs, ended. Now, it has public management. The rights of depositors and the resilience of the banking sector are guaranteed. In the future, this bank will operate as usual. I thank the team of the National Bank of Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Deposit Guarantee Fund for the quick and effective steps within the legal procedure. Another asset of the Russian oligarchs, who still continue to work within the system existing in Russia, is under the control of our state. Third. I spoke with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The topic is obvious. This is the implementation of the agreements we reached at the Alliance summit in Vilnius. The priority is unchanged: it is the fastest possible accession to NATO when security conditions allow. Only this will reliably guarantee security and peace for the whole of Europe. We also talked about the current security situation, in particular, about Russian aggressive steps in the Black Sea. Any destabilization in this region and the disruption of our export routes will mean problems with corresponding consequences for everyone in the world. The price crisis is the least of the possible consequences. We discussed with Mr. Stoltenberg our steps to unblock and ensure the stable operation of the grain corridor. In our cooperation, we have moved to a new, higher level – the level of the Ukraine-NATO Council. And this mechanism can work. I turned to Jens with a proposal to urgently convene such a meeting of the Council for appropriate crisis consultations. The meeting will take place in a few days. We can overcome the security crisis in the Black Sea. Fourth. I want to thank all the countries that this week adopted new decisions in support of our state, our people, our military, and all citizens. The Republic of Korea announced an increase in aid to Ukraine. Thank you! Azerbaijan – humanitarian assistance in the field of energy and demining. Thank you! Sweden – approved program to help us rebuild. Strategy until 2027. Thank you very much! Japan – an agreement was signed between the World Bank and Ukraine on a $1.5 billion loan under Japanese guarantees. Thank you! Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States – sanctions against persons associated with aggression. Thank you! The United States – defense aid package. Artillery, rounds, air defense – all that we need now. Thank you! Germany – a new defense supply for our warriors: tanks, artillery rounds, equipment. Grateful! And, of course, our warriors. Everyone who is currently in battle, on combat posts, and on combat missions. Thank you! Thank you that our forces are increasing the pressure on the occupiers daily. Today, I would like to especially mention our national guardsmen – warriors of the 15th operation brigade named after the Hero of Ukraine Bohdan Zavada. They are very powerfully destroying Russian evil in the South of our country. Thanks, guys, for every countered attack and for your progress! Glory to you! Separately, I want to note today the warriors of the Defense Intelligence, our intelligence unit – Tymur&#x27;s unit. Very cool, guys! Well done! Thank you! Glory to everyone who makes Ukraine stronger! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Despite any attempts to break our state and our people, we know that Ukraine has a future - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-23</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today, the liquidation of the consequences of the Russian terrorists&#x27; attack on our Odesa continues all day long. 19 missiles of various types were launched on purpose to make them harder to shoot down and cause more destruction. Last night in Odesa, one person was killed. My condolences to the relatives and friends. 20 people were injured, including four children. 11 years old, 12 years old, two 17-year-olds. Everyone is being provided with the necessary assistance. And I thank each and every person who is with Odesa. I thank everyone in the city who is helping the victims and clearing the rubble. Rescuers and doctors, military and police, volunteers and local authorities. Businesses that have joined in. I also thank all the city residents. It is very important to help each other and your city! I would also like to thank those in the world who have already condemned this latest manifestation of Russian evil. We cannot allow people around the world to get used to terrorist attacks. The target of all these missiles is not just cities, villages or people. Their target is humanity and the foundations of our entire European culture. Last night, a Russian missile - it was an X-22, an anti-ship missile - hit the altar of the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Cathedral in Odesa... One of the most valuable cathedrals in Ukraine. In 1936 it was looted and destroyed by the Bolsheviks. The cathedral was restored in independent Ukraine. And now terrorists are trying to destroy it again. Last night alone, nearly 50 buildings in Odesa were damaged, 25 of them architectural monuments. The historic center. A world heritage site that UNESCO has taken under its protection. The building of the Greek Consulate was also damaged, and this is already the second consular office in Odesa to be hit by Russian terror. Only three days ago, another such attack damaged the building of the Chinese Consulate. Obviously, all this is a global threat. The destruction of cities, the destruction of culture, the destruction of ports that are fundamental to the world&#x27;s food security. There has never been a terrorist capable of overcoming the world, and these Kremlin madmen will not succeed either. There will be Spaso-Preobrazhensky Cathedral in Odesa. We will definitely restore everything. By the way, I am grateful to Italy, Madam Giorgia Meloni, members of the Italian Parliament, and the entire Italian society for their promise to help restore Ukraine&#x27;s historical monuments. The main thing is that despite any attempts to break our state and our people, we clearly know that we, Ukraine, have a future because we are defending culture and humanity. Russia, on the other hand, is bringing only one thing closer with its terror: its dismantling from history. And one more thing. We have already started preparing for the upcoming week. There will be a lot of different events that will definitely bolster Ukraine&#x27;s defense. I thank NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg for promptly convening the first meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council. In fact, immediately after our conversation yesterday, we agreed on the date - the meeting will take place this Wednesday. We are preparing it to be meaningful. We are also preparing new support packages from our partners - everything that brings the defeat of Russian terrorists closer. More air defense for Ukraine, more artillery, more long-range weapons. The recipe for ending the war is obvious: everything depends on the unity and determination of all those who value freedom, culture and life. Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! Thank you to everyone in Ukraine who cares about their neighbors. Glory to our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia must lose every day - that&#x27;s fair - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-24</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on this day. I held a special format of the Staff meeting. We focused mostly on frontline issues. There were reports from the Commander-in-Chief, the commanders of the main directions, and the Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Maximum attention is paid to those areas where we are moving forward and those where Ukrainian forces are on the defensive. In all areas, the first task is to destroy the occupiers, their equipment, supplies, warehouses, and headquarters as much as possible. Russia must lose every day - that&#x27;s fair. And I thank all our warriors who ensure this: all our soldiers, sailors, petty officers, sergeants, officers and generals. It is very important that our defense and security forces, our entire state, work as a single team for the sake of defense. At the Staff meeting, of course, we also thoroughly discuss all issues related to protection against Russian missile and drone terror. Protection of our people, our cities, our ports, the Black Sea grain corridor. We are preparing powerful responses to Russian terrorists&#x27; attacks. I also held several political meetings, in particular on the European Union and our integration. This year we are to start negotiations on membership. Ukraine is fully prepared for this - we are doing what is necessary on our part. And we are doing everything possible to ensure that the EU is also fully prepared. Exactly this year. I also held a major meeting with government officials and our experts on international relations on the export of Ukrainian agricultural products through the territory of European countries. There is a very important agreement with the European Commission regarding September 15, which is the last day of restrictions on our grain exports, and we believe that the European side will fulfill its obligations on this date, when the temporary restrictions will cease to be in effect. Any extension of the restrictions is absolutely unacceptable and outright non-European. Europe has the institutional capacity to act more rationally than to close a border for a particular product. We are working very actively with everyone to find a solution that is in line with the spirit of our Europe. And one more thing. Occasionally, once a month, I send a special letter of gratitude to those warriors who have distinguished themselves on the frontline. Last week, I sent such a written gratitude to our glorious 56th Mariupol separate motorized infantry brigade. To all its warriors and brigade commanders. And today I received the chevron of the 56th brigade - it is already here in my office, on the board with other chevrons. And a flag signed by the guys. Thank you very much, warriors! Thank you very much, heroes! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who makes Ukraine stronger! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>When our people are doing everything possible and impossible for the victory, any internal betrayal triggers fury - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-25</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a long and eventful day. This day started early. With our usual work on receiving weapons, new defense support packages, including American ones. And I am grateful for today&#x27;s package: artillery, missiles for HIMARS, Patriots, NASAMS, drones and much more. Thank you, America! I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak. As always, it was a very practical and straightforward conversation. First and foremost, we talked about protecting our southern regions, in particular Odesa, the normal life of people and the work of our ports. Rishi and I discussed possible steps and the possible number of air defense batteries. The United Kingdom can become the leader whose assistance with air defense systems will guarantee real security. The world knows that the security of our Black Sea ports is the key to peace and stability in the global food market. Now is the time when it is important to reap the harvest of determination, security determination, so that no one will have to end up as a harvester of chaos later on neither in the countries of Africa nor anywhere on other continents. Food security is a globally important priority and part of the Ukrainian Peace Formula. Today I held a preparatory meeting before the first meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, which will take place tomorrow. The consultations are specifically about security in the Black Sea - our ports and our grain exports. We have also begun preparing an interoperability plan together with the Alliance. The second meeting with government officials and representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine was about European integration, the necessary steps and the decisions that need to be made to launch negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union. We are working on preparations for the negotiations on a daily basis. Today, a non-public but still strategically important event took place: government officials presented the results of the first year of the drone army. Not a project already, but a real Ukrainian drone army. There was a presentation of different types of Ukrainian drones used for defense, as well as a meeting with manufacturers, designers, and donors. Journalists and representatives of civil society had the opportunity to see the potential achieved by the drone army in the first year and the way the army will grow. The defense absolutely needs all drones - from fairly simple Mavic drones to maritime drones and attack drones that can operate at a great distance. By the way, we often discuss this topic at the meeting of the Staff, and often in a raised voice. But there are results, and this can be seen in the news. There will be more good news involving Ukrainian drones. And this is crucial. One more crucial point. Millions of Ukrainians are focused on one thing day after day. Not on themselves, not on their own desires, but on defending the state and their lives. But unfortunately, some people think that the war is somewhere far away from them. As if the dome of the Verkhovna Rada, or the walls of some offices, or a list of some powers can shield from reality. No one will forgive MPs, judges, &quot;military commissars&quot; or any other officials for putting themselves in opposition to the state. For some, it&#x27;s about islands and resorts during the war, for others it&#x27;s about lining one&#x27;s pockets in the military enlistment office, for others it&#x27;s about bribes in the courts. For any public official, this is a betrayal of state principles, a betrayal of the interests of society. I want to warn all MPs, officials, and everyone else in public office. When everyday you search for weapons for the state, when all the attention is on providing artillery, missiles, drones, when you constantly see and feel the moral strength gained for Ukraine by our warriors, our people, who are doing everything possible and impossible for the victory and preservation of freedom, any internal betrayal, any &quot;beach&quot; or any personal enrichment instead of Ukraine&#x27;s interests triggers fury at the very least. Fury. Remember that. Imagine how many millions of hearts in Ukraine felt the same fury. I want all MPs and officials to hear me now. You must work. In Ukraine and for the sake of the Ukrainian people. I am grateful to those MPs who are truly working for the interests of the state. And those who think about spending more time abroad and look for &quot;profitable&quot; trips so that they can combine them with business, friends or &quot;beaches&quot; - there will not be any of you. Also, there will not be those who are reluctant to make decisions necessary for our defense or European integration because of some personal benefits. Every law that is needed to strengthen the position of our troops must be adopted. Every law that is necessary for Ukraine to start negotiations with the EU on accession must be adopted. And I don&#x27;t want to hear any more excuses. And no one else does. Ukraine does not give you any more time. If you are working for Ukraine, you are needed by Ukraine, if not, you are not. One more thing. Today, I was presented with some preliminary results of the inspection of other &quot;military commissars&quot;, besides the former one from Odesa. And the results are disappointing. Of course, law enforcement officers will implement them in a legal manner, and society will see everything. But I want to say to all such &quot;military commissars&quot; and any other officials who for some reason think that society will just wait, that they can get brazen somewhere in the rear. We will win this war that Russia started. And we will win for Ukraine the kind of state life that will be worthy of our heroic defenders, of everyone who is now giving all their strength to defense. There is no place for the unworthy in such a life. And lastly. Today I have signed two decrees on awarding our warriors. 649 defenders of Ukraine have been honored with state awards. Unfortunately, 218 of them were awarded posthumously. Everyone should remember the cost of statehood, freedom and dignity. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is very important that the audacity of this attack by Russian terrorists was destroyed - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-26</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is a day that should end with a special gratitude to all our air defense warriors for every Russian missile shot down. The data is still being clarified, but according to preliminary reports, more than 30 missiles were shot down during today&#x27;s missile attack alone - the vast majority of those used against us. There were a few hits, and some missile fragments fell. But it is very important that the audacity of this attack was destroyed. The air defense units did a great job! I am grateful to everyone who protects the Ukrainian sky. And we work every day to ensure that our warriors have more and more opportunities to defend Ukraine, our cities and people. Today is no exception. Today, the first emergency meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council took place. We agreed on this meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, and we convened the Council in just a few days. Both Jens and all Allies responded promptly and in solidarity. At the level of the Alliance, the Russian attacks against our country and our ports have been clearly condemned. We discussed what specific actions can bring calm and predictability to the Black Sea region. Thank you all for the substantive work of today&#x27;s NATO-Ukraine Council! Today, the Italian Senate adopted a decision to recognize the Holodomor as genocide of the Ukrainian people. And this is very important. It is important that the world&#x27;s recognition of the historical truth about the Holodomor is becoming more and more confident - step by step, we will ensure full recognition of this truth. I held several important meetings on preparing international events in August, including the Crimea Platform. We are also preparing a list of de-occupation steps for Crimea. Comprehensive steps: security, economic, and social. We can quickly reintegrate Crimea into the state fabric of Ukraine. In fact, the occupiers should already consider that while the Crimean bridge is still somewhat operational, they should return home to Russia. Crimea, like the rest of Ukraine, will be free - free from all Russian evil, starting with Russian missiles and ending with every Russian occupier. Russia will lose this war, and no missile will save it. Glory to all those who defend Ukraine! By the way, today our guys at the front had very good results. Well done. More details later. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today, I had the honor to congratulate doctors and nurses, frontline medics on their professional holiday; I am grateful to everyone on whom the life of Ukraine depends - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-27</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We are finishing this day working in Odesa. Dnipro region, Mykolaiv and Ochakiv... Now it&#x27;s our Odesa region. Our combat medics, all our medical workers who save the lives of our soldiers and civilians, our adults and our children. Today I had the honor to congratulate Ukrainian doctors and nurses, frontline medics on their professional holiday. I awarded the best ones. But I am grateful to everyone who stays in our cities and villages, in the frontline areas, who work on the frontline, on whom the life of Ukraine really depends. I am grateful to you! In the morning, I held a meeting of the Staff. As always, we discussed key issues of our defense, protection of our skies and our cities. There were reports on the situation at the front and we are checking the &quot;military commissars&quot;. I think you can see the state&#x27;s reaction to the abuses of the &quot;military commissars&quot;. Mykolaiv has a lot of issues that need to be resolved for people, including in the regional hospital. The Minister of Health and the head of the regional administration heard everything. Ochakiv - I thank our doctors working there. They are real heroes! In Odesa, I also had the honor to award medical workers and thanked them for their work. An important conversation also took place in the presence of the Minister of Health with Commander of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Tetiana Ostashchenko. We talked about issues that are of great concern to our combat medics, our warriors. Issues on which lives depend. I expect the commander to work together with the community of combat medics, with volunteers and, on the other hand, with government officials to find the necessary solutions. I listened to the report on the liquidation of the consequences of Russian strikes on Odesa and the region. Here, in Spaso-Preobrazhensky Cathedral, which Russia tried to destroy, I feel that our people, our morale are still stronger. Stronger than the Russian terror. We are looking for air defense systems to protect Odesa and our entire south. And I am grateful to everyone in the world who has already joined us in this endeavor! One more thing. Kyiv. Today there is minus one deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. That&#x27;s fair. I think it&#x27;s also fair to say now: every intention of any official to go abroad, of any deputy, should be checked to the second. If someone really wants to take a break from working for the state, the state will also take a break from such people. I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! Thank you for the liberation of Staromaiorske. Congratulations again, guys! Once again, I would like to congratulate our esteemed medical workers on their holiday. We are very proud of you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are preparing quite important international decisions for Ukraine, for our warriors – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-28</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! Today was an important and good day. In the morning on the occasion of Statehood Day, I had the honor to congratulate and award our defenders. Gold Stars to Heroes of Ukraine, Crosses of Combat Merit, orders of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, orders For Courage... I also had the honor of presenting honored marks of distinction to combat brigades and border units. Happy that we have such warriors. I also handed over passports of citizens of Ukraine to our young boys and girls. Among them are the children of our soldiers, the children of our fallen heroes... Children. The state can and should open absolutely all opportunities for them to live in a dignified, civilized, and safe way. Live freely! For each new generation of Ukrainian men and women. And I really believe in these new generations, in our children. And I am grateful to them for their faith in Ukraine. An important international meeting took place today. The Prime Minister of Qatar was in Kyiv – very fruitful negotiations. Most importantly, Qatar will be with us in implementing the Peace Formula, joins joint global efforts. We agreed on cooperation for the return of Ukrainian children deported to Russia. We discussed the situation surrounding the Black Sea Grain Initiative – it is very important that there are no shortages and crises provoked by Russia on the world food market. It is a matter of global stability. Thanks to Qatar for the responsible position. And one more. Our international experts are preparing quite weighty decisions for Ukraine, for our warriors. We are doing our best now, we are doing it not publicly – so that the results of our warriors, which everyone will see, can also become the best. I thank everyone who helps strengthen Ukraine! Thanks to everyone who is in battle now! Congratulations again on the Day of Ukrainian Statehood and the Day of Christianization of Kyivan Rus! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Special Operations Forces mean heroism, about which impossible to tell details, they inflict particularly tangible blows on Russian terrorists – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! Today – in Donetsk region. Chasiv Yar, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, Druzhkivka, Kostiantynivka. With our warriors, our heroes. I congratulated and had the honor to personally congratulate, shake hands, and award warriors of the Special Operations Forces on the occasion of their professional day. They are always at the hottest areas of the front, on the most responsible, special tasks. And now is the same – near Bakhmut, I came to them. I thanked the guys for their strength and heroism, for their professionalism, and their extremely professional defense of Ukraine. Special Operations Forces mean such heroism about which impossible to tell the details. Only years later – such specifics of operations. The guys inflict particularly tangible blows on Russian terrorists. What we can talk about now, of course, is participation in key combat operations. Bakhmut in particular, Avdiyivka, Krasnohorivka, Maryinka. Soledar. Together with everyone, they defended Kyiv and Hostomel, and Bucha, and Irpin, and Moschun, and Makariv. Snake Island – also SOF together with intelligence, together with the Alpha group and the Navy. Kinburn Spit. Kherson. Now – the liberation of Staromayorske, this is also a result, in particular, of the SOF. During the war, 17 warriors of the Special Operations Forces were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Thirteen of them, unfortunately, posthumously. In total, 2,520 SOF warriors were awarded state awards. Thank you, warriors, for your results for Ukraine, for all our people! Thanks for the chevron, it&#x27;s a real honor! And once again I wish you the most important thing – victory! Victory over Russian evil. Dnipro. The work at the site of yesterday&#x27;s missile strike was completed already in the morning. Nine people were injured, including two children and teenagers. Everyone was given the necessary help. For every such blow, for all Russian terror, the enemy will surely feel the force of justice. We will not forget or forgive anything and none of them. Today is the anniversary of Olenivka, one of the most vile and cruel crimes of Russia. The deliberate, pre-planned killing of captured Azov warriors. Let every loss of Russia be retribution for its evil, and let every occupier, every Russian murderer, all those responsible for this terror against Ukraine and Ukrainians know – while they are still alive – that justice wins. Ukraine will win! Thanks to everyone who brings our victory closer! Eternal memory to everyone who gave his life for the sake of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Gradually, the war is returning to the territory of Russia, and this is an inevitable, natural and fair process - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-30</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today we are working in Ivano-Frankivsk, in Prykarpattia. I had the honor to visit our warriors who are undergoing treatment after being wounded. I thanked them for defending the state and for their strength. And thank you for the chevrons, guys! I thanked our doctors and nurses - we are proud of our medics, all those who save lives. We held a meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Ukraine in Ivano-Frankivsk. Our communities, government officials, representatives of defense and security forces. Partners of Ukraine cooperating with the Congress. We had a very informative conversation. The first is the energy sector, preparation for the winter. Russian aggression has gone bankrupt on the battlefield. Today is the 522nd day of the so-called &quot;special military operation,&quot; which the Russian leadership expected to last for a week or two. Ukraine is getting stronger. Gradually, the war is returning to the territory of Russia - to its symbolic centers and military bases, and this is an inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process. But we must be aware that, just as last year, Russian terrorists can still attack our energy sector and critical facilities this winter. Today we discussed with the communities the current state of preparation for all possible scenarios. We also discussed the issue of urgent reconstruction, including the energy sector, and various systems of ensuring life in the communities. Odesa, our southern regions, Kharkiv, the western regions of our country, and the northern border regions. It is very important that local authorities across the country are as active as possible right now - in the summer and in September - in everything that needs to be done before the cold months of the year. We discussed budgetary issues. Government officials will help with targeted subventions from the state budget, the amount of which is insufficient. Many other issues can be resolved by communities at their own expense and by working with extra-budgetary resources. People see who is paving the streets instead of helping soldiers, who is spending money on bot farms instead of drones for the front, who is investing in affiliated companies instead of reconstruction of hospitals and rehabilitation of the military. The number one priority is defense, protection of the state and people. I am sure everyone on the ground has heard this. Shelters and fortifications, assistance to brigades, assistance to the families of heroes, protection of IDPs - local authorities have the resources to do all this. By the way, the involvement of churches here in Ivano-Frankivsk region in addressing social issues is very important. Assistance to IDPs, families of soldiers, and the medical sector. This makes the Ukrainian social fabric more solid. I am grateful to the local authorities in Prykarpattia and other regions for supporting the work of enterprises, including the relocated ones. Every job, every Ukrainian product, and especially a defense product, is a step closer to our victory. And a few other things. We presented to the communities our work on the Peace Formula, security guarantees for Ukraine until it joins NATO, negotiations with the Alliance and the European Union. People need to understand the details of our international policy, and there is a part of it where they can help. In particular, so that Ukrainian MPs have a tangible incentive to work for the decisions Ukraine needs. All the laws necessary to start negotiations with the European Union must be passed. And if someone is not ready to work positively in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, he or she must understand what a negative impact this will have on them in their communities. And they should feel the appropriate attitude towards themselves: either they are for Ukraine, or they will have a hard time in Ukraine. And, of course, the frontline. Thank you all for this day at the front - a good day, a powerful day. Bakhmut direction, other very hot and painful areas in Donbas: Avdiivka, Maryinka, and, of course, the southern directions... The 5th assault brigade, the 80th separate airborne assault brigade, the 92nd separate and 110th separate mechanized brigades are very, very strong... The marines of the 35th and 36th brigades, the paratroopers of the famous &quot;Seventy-ninth&quot;, the 47th separate mechanized brigade, the artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade. Well done, warriors! And today I would like to especially commend the Artan special unit and the 9th department of the Main Intelligence Directorate - thank you! Glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine! Thank you, Ivano-Frankivsk, for this day! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>To protect the lives of Ukrainians, our military must have enough long-range weapons - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-07-31</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today at 7 p.m., the rescue operation in Kryvyi Rih on the site of the Russian missile strike was completed. It was two Iskander missiles. Ballistic missiles against a residential building. In one entrance, floors 4 through 9 were destroyed. Just against civilians, ordinary people, children. This is terrorism, which no one in the world will call otherwise. As of now, six people are known to have been killed, including a child, a girl, her name was Darya. She was only ten years old... Her mother died with her, her name was Nataliya... An ordinary family in an ordinary city whose lives were destroyed by Russian murderers. My condolences to all those who lost their loved ones… 69 people were injured. Dozens are now in hospitals. Some of them are in serious condition. Everyone is being provided with the necessary assistance. And I thank everyone who is fighting for people&#x27;s lives! The rescue operation was difficult. Parts of the building structure were falling. There was a fire on the fourth floor. In total, more than 350 employees of the State Emergency Service, police, and utilities were involved in the rescue. Volunteers also helped. I am grateful to everyone! Today I would like to especially mention the following employees of the State Emergency Service for the rescue operation in Kryvyi Rih: Lieutenant Vadym Kuchkurda, Junior Sergeant Volodymyr Hembichner, Petty Officer Viktor Ilika and Deputy Commander of the State Paramilitary Mining Rescue Detachment Serhiy Bytsko. Police officers: Lieutenant Colonel Mykola Harmash and Captain Roman Bondarchuk. Doctors: Vladyslav Voloshyn and Kostiantyn Isaychenkov. National Guardsmen: Sergeant Andriy Holovin, Captain Denys Tereshchenko. Utility workers Serhiy Dmytriyev and Andriy Shayda. Volunteers: Larysa Sydorenko and Viktoria Tretiak. Thank you! It is very important when we all defend lives together and help overcome Russian terror! According to preliminary data from our military, these two missiles were fired at Kryvyi Rih from the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, from the area of Dzhankoy. And this proves again and again that for the safety of our cities, for the protection of the normal life of Ukrainians and our children, our military must have enough long-range weapons, enough means to defeat terrorists. The world&#x27;s sanctions pressure against Russia deserves a significant increase. And now there is more and more open information, including investigations by journalists, about how a terrorist state circumvents global sanctions and obtains critical components for weapons production. And, by the way, we have repeatedly provided such information to our partners in a classified regime. We must act together. Significantly strengthen sanctions for terror. Significantly limit the channels of delivery of critical components for missile production to Russia. And we must respond with determination - determination to supply Ukraine with the necessary modern weapons, including long-range missiles, so that we can remove this terrorist threat that Russia is creating against our people, against our children. Today, Russian savages also shelled Kherson. They used artillery. A police officer was killed. My condolences. Nine people were wounded, including a child and four volunteers of the City of Power NGO… Despite any Russian terror, despite any attempts by Russia to blackmail the world, our collective strength - of everyone in the world who values life - is enough to overcome evil. Not only can we defeat the terrorist state, but we can also ensure that justice prevails. When all those responsible for terror are held accountable. But for this we need to increase our cooperation and pressure on the aggressor every day, every week, every month. And I thank everyone in the world who is doing just that! I thank everyone who defends freedom and humanity together with Ukraine! And, of course, our warriors. Bakhmut. The whole of Donbas, Orikhiv and all our southern positions, the border, and everyone who keeps the regions of our country calm. Our defenders of the sky. Thank you, our heroes! We are working on new weapons for you! Together we are bringing victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Your task is to ensure that the world always stands with Ukraine - President&#x27;s speech at the meeting with heads of foreign diplomatic missions of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-02</span></div>
  <p>Dear Denys Anatoliyovych, Mr. Prime Minister, dear Dmytro Ivanovych, dear participants, dear ambassadors, dear ladies and gentlemen diplomats! Today we have an important meeting, we can say that it is an emergency meeting. Recently, we have been meeting in this format once a year, in the winter, to summarize what we have done and set the main tasks for the next year. Now is a special moment when we need exactly this kind of communication, exactly this format. In a month, a new political season will begin in our partner countries. And we have managed to make the previous political seasons in the world pro-Ukrainian. Moreover, they became pro-Ukrainian in all countries whose support is vital for Ukraine and Ukrainians. Now, in August, we have to prepare for a new political season in the world so that this season, a very important season, can also become pro-Ukrainian. The period from September to December will indeed be a period of decisions. Very responsible decisions - for Ukraine, for the whole of Europe, and, no doubt, for the security of the whole world. We have to prepare the decisions of this six-month period in such a way that each decision is blue and yellow, ours, Ukrainian, national - all our decisions, decisions together with our partners, and decisions at the level of international institutions. Every decision about Ukraine and Ukrainians should be for Ukraine and for Ukrainians. It should strengthen our state and society, the entire nation - Ukrainians in Ukraine and Ukrainians in the world. It should help protect the freedom and independence of our country. And no less importantly, it should strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s position in the global competition for human capital. Nowadays, being ambassadors of Ukraine means being ambassadors of the decisions that we expect, prepare, and fill with content. Everything is very specific. I will now give you five guidelines. The Peace Formula is the first. Weapons and sanctions are the second. Ukraine&#x27;s integration into the European Union and NATO, security guarantees, and neighborhood policy are the third. The fourth is the economy, recovery, and transformation. The fifth is our people, both in Ukraine and abroad, in the countries where you work. Regarding the Peace Formula. We understand that this is no longer just the Ukrainian Formula - the Peace Formula presented by Ukraine is gradually gaining support from the global majority. The vast majority of states and peoples of the world strive for peace and international harmony, security and reliable dismantling of the threats posed by Russia. The ten points of the Peace Formula reflect this important task. In discussions with our partners, our team has managed to develop a philosophy of each point of the Peace Formula that makes working with it accessible to absolutely all states, both those that are more active in the international arena and those that are more reserved. Some states and international organizations have already undertaken very specific commitments and are cooperating with Ukraine to implement our Peace Formula. But we expect other states and all international organizations whose actions for peace can and will be significant to join this work. And this is, in particular, your responsibility, dear diplomats. Public opinion in the countries of your residence, leaders and their key advisors, the entire political class - everyone must know and understand Ukraine&#x27;s aspirations for a just and fair peace, the effectiveness of the Peace Formula, and its comprehensiveness. There are countries that can help with the security and political points of the Peace Formula, with issues of justice. There are countries whose humanitarian influence, role and tradition in international relations can help with the return of Ukrainian children who were deported by force to Russia, with the return of our soldiers, both military and civilian prisoners. We are doing our best at the national level. And you should feel the attitude within your countries, you should be aware of the emotional and political factors and use them to fully implement the Peace Formula, all ten points. It is especially important to work with the countries of the Global South, which Russia is constantly trying to manipulate. The aggressor state should not even have the opportunity to create the pretense that some significant part of the world supports the aggressor and supports Russian terror. This week, a meeting of advisors to state leaders and representatives of the Foreign Ministries will take place in Jeddah. This is the second meeting already, and it will be attended by almost 40 states. As you know, the first meeting was in Denmark, in Copenhagen. The third step will be to organize a summit, a Global Peace Summit. We are working to ensure that this happens this autumn. The summit that needs - and it is possible - a global majority. Representatives of the north and south, east and west. Autumn is very close, but there is still time to prepare for the summit and involve most of the world&#x27;s countries. It depends on your activity. Head of the Office Andriy Yermak will present here the details of the work on the Peace Formula. The next benchmark for your work - of course, today it is a priority on the battlefield - is weapons. The power of our warriors at the front is largely a consequence of the power of our agreements with our friends and partners. The more successful diplomacy is, all forms of diplomacy - official and unofficial, institutional and media, cultural diplomacy and the power of ordinary human sincerity, that is, the better we are understood in the world - the more our warriors can ultimately do. The more air defense systems we have, the more long-range capabilities we have, the more equipment we have, the more crucial and scarce shells we have. The world helps those whom it understands, and this has a clear diplomatic dimension - in fact, it is an indicator of the effectiveness of your work. Whether the country of your residence helps. This is very important. And whether you personally help Ukraine. And this applies not only to the supply, but also to the production of appropriate weapons, shells, respectively, in Ukraine. Every month we add new capacities for Ukraine - for the production of weapons and shells, for the repair and maintenance of equipment. We are increasing the production of artillery, increasing the production of missiles. For the first time in Ukraine, we are building an army of drones and a fleet of naval drones. Our goal is to make Ukraine&#x27;s defense industry one of the strongest in Europe, and this requires the support of the strongest diplomacy. There are obvious things - about the weapons our partners have that can actually be supplied to Ukraine and the production of which is needed by both us and our partners; also about public opinion in partner countries, which can fluctuate and always needs new arguments in favor of continued cooperation; Russia&#x27;s subversive activities continue, as it tries to disrupt supplies and contracts... You should know best what weapons your state of residence has, what production companies in the countries where you work on a daily basis can establish in Ukraine or together with Ukraine, and what steps are needed to enhance our defense cooperation. The first defense industry forum will be held in Ukraine in the autumn. Please work on maximizing the representation of foreign companies at this forum and on specific projects. Yes, there will be domestic companies as well, but our task is to unite everyone on the Ukrainian platform. There are regular events dedicated to drone production. There are opportunities to localize the production of military equipment, artillery and shells… I am grateful to those ambassadors who have achieved significant results on the arms front - Ukraine is receiving more weapons than anyone could have predicted at the beginning of Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But our power is still less than we need, less than our warriors need to clearly prevail over the Russian occupiers. The activity of our diplomacy must ensure that the frontline balance changes in favor of Ukraine. And it is possible. F-16. This month the training of our Ukrainian pilots will begin. Now we need to work one hundred percent with the countries that have these aircraft and will be able to transfer them to us after training. This is a powerful and challenging task. The delivery and combat use of F-16s by our pilots should take place as soon as possible. And you know which countries we are talking about. Long-range weapons. We need to continue working with our partners, and especially with the United States, to allow Ukrainian warriors to act with maximum accuracy over longer distances against the occupiers. The day must come when ATACMS will be as familiar to all of us, our warriors, as Javelins or HIMARS, and will start working in the same way. The sky shield. The entire Ukraine must be protected from Russian terror. This is indeed a very difficult task. But the accession of each new state to the defense coalitions we have created makes this fundamental task easier. A coalition of &quot;Patriots&quot; and &quot;NASAMS&quot;, &quot;SAMP-T&quot; and &quot;IRIS-T&quot; - every system that is effective and should be available... even S-300 - it&#x27;s war today, everything is important today. This means that we need more visits of leaders to Ukraine, more work with public figures and the media, with the expert community. The Ukrainian issue should remain a constant focus of attention in the countries of your residence - Ukraine needs front pages and priority attention. All of this is activity. Your personal activity. An ambassador of Ukraine is an ambassador who is heard by the country in which he or she works. You have to be effective everywhere: effective in the media, on social media, at conferences and discussions, you have to be interesting for think tanks and universities. Information, cultural, educational, and sports projects are mandatory elements of support for Ukraine and Ukraine&#x27;s policy, and they should be on the agenda all the time. And your work must be very clear to our country, our people, our society - Ukraine must see that you are really defending the position of the state and only it. Representatives of our Defense and Security Forces will be working with you here, absolutely everyone - the Commander-in-Chief, commanders, the Minister of Defense, the Head of Foreign Intelligence, the specialized Deputy Head of the Office - please take on specific tasks and fulfill them in the interests of Ukraine&#x27;s defense. The issue of sanctions policy should also be considered in this point regarding weapons. Different partners have different pace of sanctions policy. Some are leaders, others, unfortunately, hesitate and sometimes lag behind. There are countries that, unfortunately, help Russia circumvent sanctions and, in fact, continue terror on our land. Unfortunately. There are companies, in particular in the free world, that produce critical components for the defense industry, dual-use products, electronics, chips - all of which the Russian aggressor still gets through various channels despite the sanctions. Regrettably. We must turn this regret into new pressure and new solutions for the sake of Ukraine and global security. The principal task is to limit Russia&#x27;s production potential as much as possible and to persuade our partners and relevant companies and private entities on a daily basis to close all possible routes for the supply of critical components to Russia. We need to synchronize the speed of sanctions policy among our partners. Those who are lagging behind in sanctions should feel how important it is to be faster. Autumn should also be the time for a new package of EU sanctions against Russia. All these are absolutely achievable goals. The third benchmark is the European Union and NATO, security guarantees for Ukraine on its way to NATO, and our neighborhood policy. This year we must launch negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s future membership in the European Union, and Ukraine will be ready for this. Of course, there is work for the Cabinet of Ministers and the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. All the relevant laws that are part of the package to launch negotiations on our future membership must be adopted. The quality of MPs&#x27; work on this package is a matter of national security, as the European Union is economic and institutional security for Ukraine. At the same time, Ukraine is a matter of security for the European Union as well, since any uncertainty about our country means weakness. And weakness tempts Russia to be aggressive and try to fill with its presence the space where there is a lack of cooperation and a lack of EU institutions. Your task - of all those who work in the capitals and institutions of the European Union - is to consolidate Europe as much as possible for the sake of common security and common development. At the end of the year, the decision to start negotiations on our country&#x27;s accession must be approved by the European Council, and there is no alternative to this. Regarding NATO. We managed to change the philosophy of relations with the Alliance. We are finally discussing when Ukraine should be invited to join NATO. We have removed the &quot;taboo&quot; on such conversations. This is important. There is an understanding that Ukraine will be in NATO, and it is only a matter of time. A new instrument, the NATO-Ukraine Council, is already working, and exactly as a tool for integration. The first working meeting of the Council was held in response to Russian aggression against global food stability. That is, everyone sees that our cooperation with the Alliance is practical, and it should continue to be so. It should be constant. We must already start preparing for the NATO Summit in Washington. The Summit could become historic for Ukraine and all of our NATO allies - and it depends on everyone. It depends on all of you, all of you, dear diplomats, who are working for Ukraine, and on everyone in the Alliance. Security is always a joint effort, and by December of this year we must lay the foundation for such joint efforts. The task of ambassadors to NATO countries is to work to consolidate all the capitals of the Alliance around common security priorities. It is in Ukraine that security for our continent and for the rules-based international order as a whole is being gained, and this deserves political and legal recognition by all our allies. The task of ambassadors in the rest of the world is to refute Russian disinformation on a daily basis that the prospect of Ukraine&#x27;s membership in NATO was the reason for the war and that this practice led to it. It is very important to fight against this disinformation policy of the Russian Federation. To refute it. The next issue is security guarantees for Ukraine on its way to NATO. In the second half of this year, the package of security guarantees for our country will become quite specific. As of today, 12 more partner countries have joined the Joint Declaration of the G7: Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Iceland, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Finland, the Czech Republic and Sweden. This week, we are starting to work on bilateral agreements already, and the first country we are working with is the United States. In the non-public part of our meeting today, we will discuss which countries can still accede to the joint declaration and what you need to do for this, in particular at the level of ambassadors in the respective priority countries. The Office, the Foreign Ministry, and the embassies should work together in this area, and very actively. Next is the neighborhood policy. This is one of the most important areas of our joint work. And this applies not only to those ambassadors working in the EU countries. In today&#x27;s world, all free nations, all democracies, all market economies are, to some extent, neighbors. And they need good neighborliness. I am sure that our values of free nations are common. The interests of our states are in many ways related, including security interests. Our cooperation strengthens everyone. Threats to us are either similar or may be the same for all of us. The examples are obvious. If a food crisis breaks out, absolutely everyone will suffer from its consequences, and no one will be able to shield themselves from social disasters by national borders. Chaos is worse than a pandemic. Somewhere, due to a shortage in the food market, prices may rise uncontrollably, and thus lead to social chaos. Chaos and the threat of famine may lead to waves of uncontrolled migration, and this will definitely be stoked by Russia for the sake of even greater chaos. The general instability may fuel the appetite of those who, like the Russian leadership, wish harm on nations… Opening the political gates to chaos is never more profitable than protecting the lanes of solidarity. Blockades cannot be more profitable than joint initiatives for stability. Political ambitions are not worth sacrificing sincerity in relations between peoples. For Ukraine, the neighborhood policy is exclusively a policy of good neighborliness, always and everywhere, and this will be the case in everything - both in relation to grain and any other topic. Your task is to create more good neighborly opportunities for our country. To protect our interests, but also to protect the common interests with our neighbors - with all of them, except, of course, the aggressor state and its satellites. Ukraine knows how to be grateful and is grateful to every country, to absolutely all people, to every nation that helped us. But our contribution to common security deserves gratitude as well. To stop Russia from restoring its empire is to save the freedom of the nations that are within the access range of Russian military convoys. The Russian military force, which was destroyed by Ukrainians, will no longer kill in Europe or Asia or anywhere else in the world, and this is extremely significant. This means the saving of lives, including those of our neighbors. As ambassadors of Ukraine, you have to cool down emotions when they get too strong in the politics of neighbors. Cool down yet not be speechless. In the coming months, elections will be held in different countries, and this creates a certain difficult conjuncture. We need an understanding that will overcome any such internal political conjuncture. We need new manifestations of solidarity and new programs of cooperation and support, long-term systemic support. There are useful examples of such long-term support in the decisions of, inter alia, Germany, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Lithuania, and Japan. We definitely share the same understanding of freedom and protection of life with these countries. Ukrainian diplomacy should be active in order to achieve such understanding with our other partners. The fourth benchmark is the economy and recovery. It&#x27;s all obvious. The more jobs we can save and create in our country, the stronger we will all be. Every new investment in Ukraine now is one more step towards our victory. Paying taxes and excise duties in Ukraine is a very concrete help to our warriors and our defense. Every new technology that comes to Ukraine works to save the lives of Ukrainians. All the programs of patronage of partners over regions and cities that have been damaged by Russian terror and need to be restored help real, practical decentralization in Ukraine. By the way, there are already very good examples of this - for example, in Mykolaiv region in cooperation with Denmark, in Zhytomyr region in cooperation with our friends from the Baltic countries, and in Dnipro in cooperation with the Czech Republic. Local authorities are working directly with partners for recovery, and this adds more speed and efficiency. Your task is to provide more patronage, more countries, more patronage for the regions and cities, towns and villages of Ukraine, more new technologies for Ukraine, more economic activity, more new investments and, ultimately, more new jobs in Ukraine. Take a hundred of the most important companies for Ukraine and our society in the country where you work. By the end of the year, provide decisions on investments in Ukraine or memorandums on starting operations in Ukraine, as soon as the security conditions allow. But it should be something very concrete, not abstract. Take a hundred of the largest philanthropists of the country where you work and organize their visit to Ukraine. The world should see what is happening here. Be active with business associations - they should know what our country offers - what resources, production, technologies. They should know everything about the project of our post-war transformation, and thus their economic growth together with our country. And your task is to do everything possible to expand duty-free access of Ukrainian goods to the markets of partner countries. Ukraine&#x27;s unity with the world must work to strengthen the defense of our and global freedom. Humanitarian demining is a separate area without which recovery or transformation is simply impossible. We are already actively working on this, involving the help of our partners. This area is supervised by First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko. There are specific countries that can help. There is specific equipment that we need, such as drones and heavy demining machines - currently there are only 26 of them in our country. It&#x27;s too little. We need more. Madam Deputy Prime Minister will present all the details to you during the relevant session with her participation. And the fifth priority, which summarizes the work on the four I have already mentioned. Our people. Everything our state does is aimed at protecting life in Ukraine, people in Ukraine, our nation, which is now not only in Ukraine, but also in different countries of the world. We are grateful to all those who have sheltered our people, our displaced persons from Ukraine, and this is truly historic gratitude that will forever preserve warm emotions and cordiality in relations with many countries: Poland and Germany, the Baltic States and Romania, our partners from the Czech Republic, Ireland, Britain, France, Spain, Slovakia, Italy, Portugal, the United States, Canada, and many more of our true friends. With everyone who has sheltered our people. But Ukraine&#x27;s goal is to bring people back home, to preserve their ties with Ukraine, their ties with Ukrainian culture, their ties with our society. Ukrainian books, Ukrainian information space, Ukrainian education should be accessible to our people wherever they are temporarily located. And this, I believe, is your personal responsibility as well. The First Lady of Ukraine is doing a lot of work in the field of cultural diplomacy and humanitarian cooperation. Today, Olena will present the areas of this work, please pay attention. One of your mandatory tasks is to protect the rights of our people. They should feel that you are with them and for them, and therefore that Ukraine is with them. The embassies of Ukraine should be assistants to our people, and if necessary, rescuers. Of course, this requires resources. Of course, this is obvious. Resources for each embassy. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the relevant Deputy Head of the Office have reported to me on the relevant budget request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We will definitely discuss this budget request with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, so that Ukrainian embassies will have the resources to work for Ukraine. At our last meeting, we also discussed the need to amend the Law of Ukraine on Diplomatic Service. It is perfectly true that embassies should work as a single team, and ambassadors need more opportunities to form a team of representation. Have we made such changes? This is a question. We need to talk about this, and I instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the Office, to immediately and jointly complete the process of amending the laws and ensure that the new rules, and therefore opportunities for Ukrainian ambassadors, are in place by the end of this year. I would definitely like to hear from you about the decisions and steps that are needed to make cooperation with the states and international organizations you work with more effective. And for the sake of our people, so that they bet on Ukraine - on returning to Ukraine, not on full integration or even dissolution in this or that country that has sheltered them. We need a new policy on diasporas and work with representatives of all generations of Ukrainian emigration. Embassies can become both the authors and the leaders of this new policy. Please remember that time is running out and is of the utmost importance. The next half of the year will be very busy. And I am sure that in many areas it will be decisive and historic. Literally every day, we have to increase our activity. Now - the Peace Formula and security guarantees. Soon - the new Crimea Platform Summit at the level of leaders, and it should be more powerful than last year. September 6 - the Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen. Ukraine&#x27;s soft power must become more powerful. At the same time, we are holding a Food Summit as a follow-up to our humanitarian efforts under the Grain from Ukraine program. Autumn is the UN General Assembly, where Ukraine should be represented strongly. This is the Global Peace Summit. This is the Crimea Platform at the level of parliaments. We continue to work on organizing platforms, conferences, and summits between Ukraine and Latin America, between Ukraine and Africa. Autumn is the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor genocide. We must honor the memory of the victims of the Holodomor with dignity and at a high level, and we must commend the efforts of those countries that join us in defending the historical truth and recognize that it was genocide against the Ukrainian people. Autumn is the launch of negotiations with the European Union on future membership. December is the time to see what Ukraine will get from the NATO Summit in Washington. Plus, of course, Ramstein - let&#x27;s not forget about regular defense activities. Plus bilateral cooperation. Visits to Ukraine and my visits to partner countries, if they are really prepared - each visit should provide more weapons for our warriors and more strength for our state. Plus the economy. Plus humanitarian cooperation. Let&#x27;s not forget that you must facilitate the treatment and rehabilitation of our soldiers and civilians in the countries of your residence. Every week, please report to yourself and to Ukraine on what you have done to make our country and our people stronger. Often it just depends on activity, often it really depends on perseverance and agency, because the world wants to hear Ukraine, and we have already achieved this. Your task is to ensure that the world always stands with Ukraine. Activity is the key to diplomacy. There are ambassadors who work this way every day. There are also those who are more of a figurehead, and the real work is done by others and at a different level. During this time, from August to December, no one has the right to be a figurehead, and everyone must become a winner in their field, because it is all for the sake of Ukraine. This is what I wish you all - victories and activity. And this is what I thank you all for today. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Zakarpattia will be one of the drivers of development for the whole of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-02</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! It was a long and very busy day. In the morning, we received reports from our warriors, from air defense on the downing of &quot;Shaheds&quot;. There were 37 &quot;Shaheds&quot; in total during this one night. Some of them were shot down. But only part of them. Fortunately, people were not injured. There were hits in the southern areas - Odesa region, our ports. We are doing our best with our partners to increase the supply of air defense systems. It is very important for the world not to get used to this Russian terror. Every hit is a common problem. Not only for Ukraine, but also for all those in the world whose stability Russia is trying to destroy by attacking our ports and infrastructure. Now, for the Russian state, this is a battle not only against our freedom, not only against our state. Moscow is fighting a battle for a global catastrophe: these lunatics need the world food market to collapse - they need price crises, supply disruptions. Someone in Moscow thinks they can make money on this... Someone in Moscow hopes they will be able to bargain for something... These are very, very dangerous hopes. In particular, we talked about food security today with our ambassadors - I held an extraordinary large meeting with all the heads of Ukrainian diplomatic missions. We gathered in Zakarpattia. On the eve of a new political season in our partner countries. For 16 months of full-scale war, we have been working together - the entire diplomatic team of Ukraine, everyone who works in the field of our foreign policy - to make sure that the world sees events in a completely truthful way. The way they are happening, not the way Russian propaganda wants to depict them. Most countries in the world stand with Ukraine. We have achieved extremely significant results in supplying weapons to our troops. There are powerful sanctions against Russia for terror. Now there are new tasks for Ukrainian diplomats - to attract defense production to Ukraine... equipment, artillery, shells. To expand training missions for our warriors. To ensure the supply of F-16s. Long-range missiles for Ukraine. And always - absolutely always - political decisions in favor of our country, our freedom. The Crimea Platform, the UN General Assembly, the Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen, the Global Food Summit, and the very important Peace Formula Summit, to which we are inviting the world&#x27;s majority, are ahead. The launch of accession negotiations with the European Union is a task for this year. Preparing more in our relations with NATO is also a task that our diplomats have to fulfill. Today we talked about all this in great detail. Ukrainian diplomacy has very clear, significant accomplishments. In all areas. We do not forget about the sphere of national memory, our history. This year marks the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor, and we are constantly active in communicating with partners to recognize the historical truth - to recognize the Holodomor as genocide of the Ukrainian people. Already 28 states have recognized the Holodomor as genocide - this is at the state level. In four more countries, one of the chambers of national parliaments has adopted a decision. And during the full-scale war alone, 17 such recognition decisions were made. This is a very high pace. And all Ukrainian diplomats should maintain this pace - remain that active in the interests of Ukraine. Every day, every week, every month, they should prove with concrete results for Ukraine that our diplomacy can and will be a global leader. I held a meeting on the security and social situation in Zakarpattia. General Deyneko, Head of the State Border Guard Service, reported on border issues, which are strategic for the region. A thorough report by head of the regional administration Mykyta - it is clear that the region has the necessary results. Well done! Relocation of business and creation of new jobs in different communities of the region is an important area of work. Facilities for the rehabilitation of our warriors are the right projects. Many initiatives to develop the economy of Zakarpattia - those opportunities that have not been used for decades. In particular, the development of a salt deposit has already begun here in the region, which can provide all of Ukraine with table and industrial salt. There are other projects that we will discuss with government officials. Zakarpattia will definitely be one of the drivers of development for the whole of Ukraine, economic and social growth. I am finishing this day in Berehove with a meeting with representatives of the Hungarian community in Ukraine. It is an important meeting. Educators, doctors, representatives of public and religious organizations and, of course, our warriors, whom I had the honor to award. Brave and courageous warriors whom we are proud of - all of them. All of us, Ukrainians, all of us, citizens of Ukraine. Everyone defends our country and freedom, everyone strives for victory for Ukraine, to live in Ukraine and develop life here - for the sake of their families, for the sake of their children. I thank everyone who defends freedom! I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! The 128th separate mountain assault brigade of Zakarpattia and the 101st separate brigade of the Territorial Defense... Thank you, warriors. Today - especially! Thank you all - Berehove, Uzhhorod, Mukachevo and all of Zakarpattia! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everyone must work for the victory, for the protection of people and Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-03</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! There were many meetings today. Different ones. International work, internal security, defense of the state. The meeting on the Crimea Platform - the content of the summit, the international presence at the summit, its impact on our ability to keep up the pressure for the liberation of Crimea - we are working on the details. And we are already preparing not only the Crimea Platform Summit at the level of leaders in August, but also the parliamentary dimension of the Crimea Platform, which will be held in the autumn. Today is the second day of an important meeting with the ambassadors of Ukraine in Zakarpattia region. Yesterday and today we had the highest political and highest military levels of communication. The ambassadors had very substantive conversations with the Minister of Defense, the Commander-in-Chief, Commander of the Air Force, Vice Admiral Neizhpapa, the Commander of the Naval Forces, Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service Lytvynenko, and NSDC Secretary Danilov. All of them. I specifically asked Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, the commanders and Mr. Kuleba to hold such a meeting to discuss the key things that our warriors and defense forces need so much, so that they could convey all this to the ambassadors. Prime Minister Shmyhal, Yulia Svyrydenko, Stefanishyna, Kubrakov also attended the meeting today. There was also a meeting between the ambassadors and Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk on parliamentary diplomacy, which can be very effective if it is fully consistent with our overall state strategy. It is important that the ambassadors of Ukraine are fully informed about every need of Ukraine in great detail. Weapons, equipment, munitions, finances, specific political decisions... I thank everyone who was active at this meeting in Zakarpattia, and I thank Zakarpattia for such a welcome. Today, there were reports from Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Malyuk and Minister of Internal Affairs Klymenko. In particular, one of the issues is the inspection of the &quot;military commissars&quot;. We talked in detail. The inspection reveals many abuses. Frankly disgusting ones. All the facts revealed by law enforcement officers will be presented to the public and investigated in the framework of criminal proceedings. The conclusion is obvious: the recruitment system needs people who understand the value of defending Ukraine. The value, not the price of decisions. People who have seen the war and gone through it should work in the &quot;military enlistment offices&quot;. There are those who, unfortunately, lost their limbs, but did not lose their dignity and did not lose Ukraine. I am grateful to them. Minister Klymenko reported separately and in detail on the training of our National Guardsmen - the provision of ammunition and equipment is a priority. He also spoke about the protection of critical facilities, including nuclear power plants. We discussed the situation in the regions after the Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, and the provision of all necessary supplies to people. The Minister also reported on measures taken to combat crime. There were informative reports on the entire range of work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. And, of course, the frontline. The battles are tough, the occupiers are trying their best to stop our guys. The assaults are very fierce. Kupyansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Maryinka, Avdiivka directions. Southern directions. It is difficult everywhere. But no matter what the enemy does, it is the Ukrainian force that dominates. And I am grateful to everyone on the frontline for this! Today I would like to recognize the warriors of the 15th operational brigade of the National Guard. Melitopol direction. Thank you, guys! I would also like to mention the warriors of the Izmail border guard detachment who, together with the maritime units, counter Russian &quot;Shahed&quot; attacks. In total, the terrorists have already launched at least 1961 &quot;Shaheds&quot; against Ukraine, and a significant number of them have been shot down. Unfortunately, not all of them. We are working to shoot down more - to shoot down as many as possible. We are working to have more air defense systems. In particular, this is a task for each of our ambassadors, all representatives of Ukraine. Everyone must work for the victory, for the protection of life. The lives of people and the protection of our beautiful Ukraine! We will definitely win. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Fair and honest end to Russian aggression will benefit everyone in the world – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-04</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! A brief report for the day. The first is a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff. The meeting was long, much longer than planned. The situation on the front line was analyzed in detail, all areas – those where we are holding the line, and those where we are moving forward step by step. The commanders reported: Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, General Syrsky, General Tarnavsky. We discussed in detail how and in what terms, what kind of support, what kind of logistics would be the best result for Ukraine. Manufacturing of ammunition and weapons in Ukraine, by our defense industry. We simplify all procedures as much as possible, remove all red tape still hindering manufacturers. Minister for Strategic Industries Kamyshin reported. The result will be. The Black Sea and food exports, the security of our ports – the commander of the Navy, government officials, intelligence chiefs reported. Let not the Russian terrorists even hope they would manage to provoke a global food crisis or create another price calamity. Ukrainian food exports are a key factor in the stability of food markets. And we work with all our partners both in the region and in the world in general to guarantee food security. By the way, Tomorrow in Jeddah – in Saudi Arabia – a meeting of advisors to heads of state and representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Peace Formula will begin. Many countries will be represented, different continents, including the countries of the Global South. It is very important because in such matters as food security, the fate of millions of people in Africa, Asia, and other parts of the world directly depends on how fast the world will be in implementing the Peace Formula. I am grateful to Saudi Arabia for this platform for negotiations. A meeting in the same format was recently held in Copenhagen. We are moving step by step towards the Global Peace Summit. It is very important that the world sees: a fair and honest end to Russian aggression will benefit everyone in the world. Everyone! Liberating Ukrainian land from the occupiers means restoring full respect for international law and the UN Charter. Eliminating all threats created by Russia to Ukrainian and global security means returning peace to international relations and stability to global life. I am grateful to everyone who supports the Peace Formula and has already joined the joint efforts for the full implementation of the Formula. Today, I had the opportunity to once again thank everyone who in the United States is helping Ukraine to defend its freedom: both parties, Congress, President Biden, every American family and community. American leadership is indeed vital. And not only for freedom in our region – these are global things. And at a meeting with Christopher Christie, one of the influential figures in American politics, a member of the Republican Party, we talked about exactly how important it is to strengthen support for freedom, support for democracy. And I am grateful that Mr. Christie is one of those people who wants to see the situation with his own eyes. He began his visit to Ukraine with a visit to Bucha. There one can fully see what Russian aggression brings to Ukraine and all of Europe, the entire free world. Today, there was also a report by SSU Chief Maliuk. I will not voice the content. I will only say that we are all grateful to the Security Service of Ukraine for returning the war to the aggressor state. What you bring to the world, you end up with it yourself. Thankful to all our heroes! Thankful to everyone in the world who supports Ukraine! Thankful to everyone who brings the implementation of the Peace Formula closer! We must win. And we will win! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>International rules-based order violated by Russian aggression must be restored – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-05</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! Today is another active day for our international efforts. Our team is working in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, at the meeting of advisors to the leaders of the states on the Peace Formula. In total, 42 countries are represented there. Different continents, different political approaches to global affairs, but everyone is united by the priority of international law. And it is for this that Ukraine proposed the Peace Formula because the international rules-based order, violated by Russian aggression, must be restored. It is very important that there, on the sidelines of the meeting in Jeddah, bilateral negotiations with partners take place. Thankful to our delegation for this work: consolidation of the world is one of the most essential tasks. The greater the consolidation of the world for the sake of restoring a just peace is the sooner an end will be put to the bombs and missiles with which Moscow wants to replace the norms of international law. Another Russian missile attack against our country was today. Kinzhal, Kalibr missiles. Their target was Motor Sich and our Khmelnytsky region. Some of the missiles were shot down, thankful to our air defense warriors for this. But no matter how many such Russian attacks occur, they will still not give the enemy anything. Anyway, we will protect freedom for Ukraine, for all our people. And Russia won&#x27;t be able to replace international law with terror, or crises, or any intimidation. Literally every week, the world really adds strength to protect normal life. This week I thank Germany and Lithuania for new defense and security packages for us, for our soldiers. We expect new solutions next week – new packages. We also work for even more achievements and opportunities in our defense industry. The results are there, everyone can see them, and they are fair results, correct. Which show the aggressor state what its aggression means. Show not on TV, but precisely in the place, from which this war came to Ukraine, to the region, to the world. He, who brings problems to others, must feel what problems are. And I thank the Security Service of Ukraine, our Navy and every warrior who restores justice and teaches Russia to losses. Ukraine will win this war. The world will win this war. Truth will win this war. The main thing is that all of us in Ukraine and everyone in the world, who value a normal life, work at one hundred percent without any stop for the sake of victory. Our unity, our ability to build strength, and our ability to bring war back to where it came from. It is the most tangible for Russia. And one more. Next week our work on cleaning public institutions from those who tried to drag from the past all those old habits, old schemes that weakened Ukraine for a very long time, for decades, will continue. There will be no more old formats in our country – those formats when some defended the state and people, and others tried to put both the state and people at the service of their own benefit. No matter, who this person is – whether he is a &quot;military commissar,&quot; whether he is a deputy, or whether he is an official – everyone must work only for the sake of the state. So be it. I thank everyone who fights for Ukraine! In all areas: Kupiansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Mariinka, Shakhtar, Zaporizhzhia. I thank everyone who moves forward, who leads forward and only forward! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine needs strength and maximum focus on achieving victory - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-06</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I was honored to congratulate all our warriors of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on their professional day. All of our pilots and anti-aircraft gunners, specialists who provide the technical side of our aviation and air defense... This is the day of true Ukrainian heroes who save lives and protect our cities and villages from Russian terror against all odds. What is very important is that our Air Force warriors give not only us, but also the entire free world a clear confidence that Russian terror can be defeated. Today, I heard a report on the use of advanced air defense systems - Patriots and IRIS-T, which we received from our partners - by our warriors. I am grateful to every country, every leader who helped us with them! These are powerful systems, very effective... They have already yielded significant results. And not only for Ukraine. Because every destruction of Russian missiles in our skies, especially air-launched ballistic &quot;Kinzhals&quot;, which Russian terrorists have long boasted about... Every success of our warriors is a reassurance to the world that a terrorist state is not able to undermine common security. In this week alone, Russian terrorists have already used 65 different missiles and 178 attack drones against us, including 87 &quot;Shaheds&quot;. We managed to shoot down a significant number of them. We will do our best to make the Ukrainian sky shield only stronger. Here, in our skies, we can prove that terror is losing. All together we can prove it - all partners. The responsible position of each partner in supplying air defense systems and missiles to them is very important. Complete protection against terror is needed here, so that later there is no need to think about protecting other nations from it. Ukraine can win this battle, and our sky shield will eventually guarantee security for the whole of Europe. Today, I awarded our Air Force servicemen and talked to them. We are equally eager to see F-16s in action in the Ukrainian skies as soon as possible. We are doing everything for this. Today, I also handed over the Gold Stars of the Hero of Ukraine to the families of the pilots killed in action for the sake of our country. Eternal memory to every hero and eternal gratitude to every Ukrainian family that gave our people such heroes... May Ukraine&#x27;s victory in this terrible war be the highest honor to all those who chose the defense of our people as their destiny! We are already preparing for the next week to further strengthen our state and our positions. There will be new communication with partners on defense packages for Ukraine. We will add even more content to the international events of August and September that have already been planned. These include the Crimea Platform, the Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen, and our participation in the UN General Assembly. Of course, we will also continue the internal purge of our state from those who, unfortunately, weaken Ukraine through their abuses. Ukraine needs only strength, only maximum focus on achieving victory. If someone already thinks that the war is &quot;somewhere over there&quot; and that someone else has to win the war, then they need to come back to reality. Only as a nation can we pull through. Every day we need to deliver results for Ukraine and for all those who are fighting for Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who is bringing our victory closer in this way! Glory to our warriors! Glory to our people! To the strong and beautiful people! And once again, congratulations on the Day of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everyone who captures the occupiers at the front speeds up freedom for Ukrainians – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-07</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! A rescue operation is underway in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region. After Russian missile strikes. Iskander missiles against ordinary residential buildings. All our services are working on the scene. Unfortunately, there are victims. There are wounded, there are casualties. My condolences to the families and friends... Unfortunately, the second missile strike resulted in the death of an employee of the State Emergency Service. Colonel Andriy Omelchenko, Deputy Head of the State Emergency Service Main Department in Donetsk region. May he always be remembered... I would like to recognize the rescuers today. Our employees of the State Emergency Service. Those who work in different cities of Ukraine for the sake of life. To make the Russian terror lose, because lives are saved. Employees of the State Emergency Service of Kherson region: civil protection service Sergeant Vitaliy Murzenko and civil protection service Lieutenant Volodymyr Yavtushenko. Employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine of Kharkiv region: civil protection service Master Sergeant Serhiy Hladkyi and civil protection service Colonel Andriy Solianikov. Employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine of Dnipropetrovsk region: civil protection service Sergeant Kostiantyn Poturaiko and civil protection service Captain Vitaliy Denysenko. All of them have repeatedly participated - directly participated - in eliminating the consequences of terrorist attacks, in saving the lives of our people. And, of course, all the employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa regions. I thank the entire staff of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine! Today we have an important result for our team that deals with exchanges. 22 more men are back home in Ukraine. 20 of them are soldiers and sergeants, two are officers. They are servicemen of the Armed Forces. There are wounded among them. They were captured in different areas of the front. But now they are home. And we will do everything to bring back to Ukraine all our people who are now in Russian captivity. We remember everyone and are looking for everyone on the list of missing persons. Fortunately, we manage to bring our people back. And it is important that this is a common task. It is a task for those who organize the exchanges: Yermak, Budanov, Malyuk, Klymenko. Thank you, guys! And the task of those who replenish the exchange fund for our country. Everyone who captures the occupiers at the front, who is active on the frontline. Each such warrior of ours speeds up freedom for Ukrainians. It is important to remember this. The day began with a conference call. First of all, the military. A report on the situation at the front - our offensive actions, the capabilities of our movement and the dynamics of the movement. The Commander-in-Chief delivered the report. Of course, there were reports on the supply of munitions and equipment, on our weapons production. The Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Strategic Industries. We are constantly increasing volumes! Both in supply and production. And we are constantly removing bureaucracy and making regulations more flexible. Our defense industry will reach the level that the state needs. Ukraine has this power. And I thank everyone who is working on Ukrainian production for this power! Frontline. I would like to mention the Bakhmut direction. The 3rd and 5th separate assault brigades, &quot;Fury&quot; assault brigade of the National Police, the 92nd separate mechanized brigade. There are successes in destroying the occupiers, important successes. I thank you, warriors! One more thing. August 7. Every year on this day, the world remembers Russia&#x27;s aggression against Georgia. 15 years have passed. The Russian occupation remains - this wound on the body of the Georgian state remains. Many words have already been said that if the world had been decisive back in 2008, many things would have been different. Back then already Russia should have realized that the aggressor pays the highest price for aggression. It must definitely realize this now. When Ukraine wins this war, it will not only stop the expansion of Russia&#x27;s aggressive appetites, it will not only save other nations from what we are going through - Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova. Our victory will return normalcy to everyone - it will end the Russian occupation. Ukrainians stand in solidarity with the people of Georgia, and I thank all Georgian citizens who are defending freedom with us! And especially those who are fighting as part of the defense and security forces of Ukraine! Freedom will win, Georgia will win, Ukraine will win! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Step by step, we are making de-occupation of Crimea more and more achievable and well-thought-out - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-08</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! This afternoon, rescue operations in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, after yesterday&#x27;s missile attack by Russian terrorists have been completed. Nine people were killed. My condolences to the families and friends. 82 people were wounded. Everyone is being provided with the necessary assistance. Among the wounded are two children, boys, one of them is in serious condition. His name is Mykyta, he is only 11 years old, he is a 6th grade pupil. I wish a speedy recovery to everyone who suffered from this yet another Russian atrocity. There were several missile strikes. The second strike took place when the rescue operation began. This is a deliberate decision of the terrorists to cause the greatest pain and damage. And Russia will bear maximum responsibility for this - no matter how the events unfold, there must be sentences against the terrorists. Today I would like to recognize the participants of this rescue operation in Pokrovsk. Those who proved themselves most active in helping people. These are civil protection service Senior Lieutenants Andriy Samusin and Oleksandr Shylo, and civil protection service Colonel Vyacheslav Filiushyn. National Police officers Lieutenant Oleksandr Chivenkov and Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Nikulin. I am especially grateful to all the medics working for people in Pokrovsk and other cities of Donetsk region, and today I would like to recognize feldsher of Myrnohrad Kateryna Zhelezniak and surgeon of Pokrovsk hospital Ihor Klimov. Thank you! I am grateful to everyone who saves lives and eliminates the consequences of Russian strikes. Today I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, and the key issue in our conversation was the protection of people, protection from Russian occupiers. We discussed in detail how to reinforce our warriors on the frontline and provide greater security to our cities and villages, to our entire land. We are preparing new defense packages, and I am grateful to Mark personally and to everyone in the Netherlands - each and every one who stands with Ukraine. We are preparing to upgrade our aviation with modern aircraft, and it is the Netherlands that can become a leader in the issue of F-16s for Ukraine. It is important that the Netherlands acceded to the G7 declaration on security guarantees for our country, and we discussed how these guarantees can be specified at the bilateral level. In addition, I invited Mark, Mr. Prime Minister, to participate in the Crimea Platform Summit at the level of leaders, which will take place on August 23. Today, I also held a meeting on the content of our return policy, specifically regarding Crimea and its reintegration. It is obvious that after the liberation of Crimea from occupation, economic opportunities, personal security for people, and a sense of real freedom, which has not been there since 2014, will return there. But all of this should not be just abstract - every detail of the de-occupation of Crimea should have a specific meaning. How exactly normal life returns. What exactly this means for Crimea and for all our people. This should be clear to everyone. Step by step, we are making the de-occupation of Crimea more and more achievable and well-thought-out. Today I also held a meeting on the new educational season - September 1 will come soon. Parents and teachers have questions. There are various security and preparatory nuances. The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko, Minister of Education and Science Oksen Lisovyi, and their plans were presented. The content is obvious: preparation of shelters, provision of textbooks, financial and organizational resources that are needed and which the state can help with. Government officials will soon present the relevant details. And one more thing. Today, I had the honor to congratulate our warriors-signallers on their professional day and awarded the best of them. 24 people who serve Ukraine in different units and at different levels. Serve as efficiently as it is necessary. The Signal and Cyber Security Troops of Ukraine are not often talked about. But all types and branches of the troops depend on them, on the quality of their work. Because communication is one of the key resources. And I thank everyone who serves our country well and works for the state efficiently. There must always be a result for Ukraine. Every day at the front and in the rear... Every such day - with results - brings our victory closer. Like today - with a law enforcement result for Ukraine. For the cleaning of Ukraine. We all know that our state must change, must undergo transformation. And this means that those who work for their own benefit, not for the sake of Ukraine, will not be in public office or MPs of Ukraine. Every such dealmaker will at least stand trial. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The task of everyone in Ukraine is to increase the potential of our capabilities at the front and weaken the occupiers - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-09</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on the day. The key thing today is long and very detailed important meetings with our military. First, there was the Staff. A special format - a narrow circle, only key people. We analyzed the current situation at the front, the main directions of our offensive actions. What is going well. What needs to be reinforced. What we are planning for the near future. There were reports from the Commander-in-Chief, the commanders directly responsible for the eastern and southern directions, as well as the report from the Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Separately, there was also a special communication between our commanders, the Head of the Office, international relations officials and partners to provide our warriors with ammunition and equipment. Everyone in Ukraine has the same task: to increase the potential of our capabilities at the front and to weaken everything the occupiers are trying to use to put pressure on our warriors or restrict Ukraine. Today we have good news from Germany - exactly what we agreed upon with Olaf Scholz. We have additional Patriot launching stations. Thank you very much, Olaf, for this - it is necessary to protect our people from Russian terror. I thank Germany and Mr. Chancellor personally for fulfilling this agreement - it will definitely save thousands of lives of our people. It will definitely bring us closer to creating a full-fledged sky shield for Ukraine. This will help people, cities and villages. Today, Russian terrorists hit Zaporizhzhia again - an ordinary building was hit, a church and a residential building were damaged… As of now, unfortunately, it is known that there are dead... there are wounded. My condolences to the families and friends who have lost their loved ones. Every day, every week, we work to ensure that our defenders of the sky have more air defense systems and missiles for them. Tomorrow I will continue this work, trying my best to provide more protection for the sky. Our entire territory needs much more air defense systems than we have now. Step by step, we are turning this &quot;much more&quot; into concrete capabilities of our Air Force, our anti-aircraft gunners, our mobile firing brigades. We are also preparing more specifics on modern fighters for our warriors: I have no doubt that F-16s will be in our skies. I thank everyone who helps us protect people from Russia&#x27;s terror! Thank you to everyone who shares our aspiration for the complete liberation of Ukrainian land from the occupier! Of course, I thank each of our soldiers, each sergeant, officer and general who give Ukraine the results it needs at the front! Today, I would like to thank the 35th separate marine brigade and the 55th separate artillery brigade. You are simply brilliant, warriors! Glory to all those who are fighting for the sake of Ukraine, for the sake of each of us! Glory to all who save lives! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine must realize its historic chance for development gained by the courage of our people - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-10</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a long, exhausting day. A day of briefings, discussions, meetings. We continue to prepare the Ukrainian Doctrine, a thorough text that will serve as a basis for the transformation of our country. We do not forget our main goal - to win the war and not to lose the country. Ukraine must realize its historic chance for development gained by the courage of our people - our entire nation. We are also preparing more defense packages for our warriors and more defense systems for the entire Ukrainian society, including air defense systems. Today I also had a conversation with representatives of the UK military leadership - a confidential conversation. But an effective one. As for today&#x27;s meetings, which are worth mentioning publicly... I spoke with a representative of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Metropolitan Emmanuel. We are working at all levels and with all actors in global relations to implement the Peace Formula, in particular, to return children deported from our land to Ukraine. I am grateful to the Ecumenical Patriarchate for its willingness to help. Of course, as always, we talked about strengthening the spiritual independence of Ukraine and about spiritual peace in Ukraine. Our country is one of the historical centers of Christianity. And it will remain so. Ukrainians have managed to build a special format of religious relations in their home: our country has a Council of Churches and Religious Organizations, which guarantees that all communities are respected, all communities can express their opinions to the state, and all communities can participate in solving socially important issues. The state will never allow any of the Ukrainian religious communities to be used by the aggressor state. Ukraine will endure, will preserve its independence - all aspects of independence, including spiritual one. And I am grateful to everyone in the world who supports our country and our people in this. But first of all, I am grateful to each and every person who is fighting for our independence. Today I would like to recognize our warriors. Those who deserve special gratitude, who show exceptional courage and give the state exceptional results. Glory to you, warriors! Soldier Oleksandr Hryn, the 81st separate airmobile brigade. Thanks to Oleksandr, more than two dozen invaders have been killed and wounded. Soldier Oleksandr Hrinko, our &quot;Eightieth &quot;, airborne assault troops. Thank you, Oleksandr, for replenishing our exchange fund. Soldier Artem Aizentsimmer, the 5th separate assault brigade. Soldier Iryna Shevchenko, chief sergeant-instructor of the 1st mechanized battalion. Soldier Andriy Maksychka, the 54th Hetman Mazepa separate mechanized brigade, Bakhmut direction. He took out the wounded, was wounded himself, but returned to the frontline after recovery. Soldier Ivan Harbuz, the 36th separate marine brigade, fighting in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Senior soldier Serhiy Prymochenko, spotter of the mortar crew of the 54th Hetman Mazepa separate mechanized brigade. Senior soldier Viktor Dorenskyi, airborne assault troops, the 80th brigade. Battles near Klishchiivka, very powerful! Senior soldier Maksym Makarenko, a member of the &quot;Eightieth&quot;, fighting for Ukraine in Donbas. Senior soldier Oleksandr Lysenko, the 5th separate assault brigade. Senior sailor Anatoliy Lukyanov, the 37th separate marine brigade, a very brave warrior! Sergeant Olha Voytiuk, sanitary instructor, the 1st mechanized battalion. Sergeant Ruslan Malitsky, the 38th separate marine brigade. Junior Sergeant Mykyta Myskov, our glorious 55th artillery brigade &quot;Zaporizhzhia Sich&quot;. Chief Petty Officer Andriy Skotnytskyi, our 36th separate marine brigade. Thank you, Andriy, for your heroism in repelling the Russian assaults. Junior Lieutenant Andriy Skibin, the 10th separate mountain assault brigade &quot;Edelweiss&quot;. A very effective man! Senior Lieutenant Serhiy Fedchyk, the 3rd mechanized battalion. Major Maksym Zakharchenko, deputy commander of a tank battalion. I am proud of all of you, our warriors! Each and every one of you! And I would like to particularly commend the units that ensure the offensive of our troops. These are the units of Ukrainian sappers. They are clearing the Ukrainian land of Russian mines, opening the way for our troops to move forward. The 808th separate support regiment, the 48th Kamyanets-Podilskyi engineering brigade, the 143rd Joint Training Center of the Support Forces - thank you all! Glory to all who fight for the independence and freedom of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>People who know exactly what war is should run the system of territorial recruitment centers - address by Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-11</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I have just held a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council. A special one. The key issue was the results of the inspection of the &quot;military commissars&quot;. Reports were delivered by the State Bureau of Investigation, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Prosecutor General, the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, and the National Anti-Corruption Bureau. Comprehensively. In total, there are already 112 criminal proceedings against officials of the territorial recruitment centers. 33 suspects. Regional, city and district &quot;military commissars&quot;. Employees of the military medical commissions. Other officials. Abuses in different regions: Donetsk, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Kyiv, Lviv. Some took cash, some took cryptocurrency - that&#x27;s the only difference. The cynicism is the same everywhere. Illicit enrichment, legalization of illegally obtained funds, illegal benefit, illegal transportation of persons liable for military service across the border. Our decisions are the following. We are dismissing all regional &quot;military commissars&quot;. This system should be run by people who know exactly what war is and why cynicism and bribery in times of war constitute treason. Instead, warriors who have gone through the frontline or who cannot be in the trenches because they have lost their health, lost their limbs, but have retained their dignity and have no cynicism are the ones who can be entrusted with this system of recruitment. This decision is to be implemented by Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny. The new heads of territorial recruitment centers will be vetted by the Security Service of Ukraine before their appointment. Every &quot;military commissar&quot; against whom there is a criminal investigation will be held to account. Absolutely fair. In full. If the dismissed &quot;military commissars&quot; and other officials wearing shoulder marks against whom no evidence of crimes or violations has been found want to keep their shoulder marks and prove their dignity, they should go to the war front. However, I emphasize that the army is not and will never be a substitute for criminal punishment. Officials who confused their shoulder marks with profits will definitely stand trial. The issue of the military medical commissions. Now this system is not working decently. The way they treat warriors, the way they treat their duties... It&#x27;s just immoral. In two weeks, the National Security and Defense Council will hold a meeting on this issue. Inspections are underway, proposals are being prepared. Decisions will also be made. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are doing everything to ensure that Ukraine remains a guarantor of food security and has access to global markets - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-11</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A report on this day. In the morning, we had a conference call. Military, intelligence, government officials. The conversation was accompanied by the sounds of air defense in Kyiv region. There were reports by commanders and ministers. The Ministry of Internal Affairs reported on the situation in the regions, the liquidation of the consequences of Russian strikes, and the work of the State Emergency Service. I am grateful to all Ukrainian rescuers! The Ministry of Strategic Industries reported on the production of munitions and equipment in Ukraine. We are increasing the volume. Constantly increasing. The Security Service of Ukraine is doing a good job against collaborators. Thank you, guys! In the afternoon, I held a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council on &quot;military commissars&quot;. There will be another meeting on the military medical commissions. We are constantly working with our partners at all levels. Today, Head of the Office Yermak, Minister of Foreign Affairs Kuleba, and the Office&#x27;s specialized deputies, Andriy Sybiha and Ihor Zhovkva, worked with the ambassadors of partner countries on the Peace Formula, on getting countries to join. And I spoke with the President of Zambia. Bilateral relations, the Peace Formula. Another country in the Global South supports our initiatives. This is very important. We had a separate meeting with Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov, Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, Navy Commander Neizhpapa, Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Malyuk, and the Ministry of Infrastructure to discuss alternatives to exporting grain through the transit corridor. We are doing everything possible to ensure that Ukraine remains a guarantor of food security and that our people have access to global markets. And, of course, the frontline. Every direction, every key effort. Daily attention. Daily support. Daily reinforcement. I am grateful to everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! To all those who are now in trenches, on combat missions, at combat posts! I thank everyone who works for the state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is important that every week Russia sees new international activity in support of Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-12</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! We have another result in our work with partners for security guarantees – Greece joined the G7 declaration regarding guarantees for Ukraine. This is already the 14th country. Along with Greece, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and Sweden have joined. I thank each state! And our team will continue working – for the sake of new participants, for the sake of every state and for every leader interested in peace and security being able to show their leadership in one or another format of security cooperation. Peace has no alternative. Every country that works with us within the framework of security guarantees for Ukraine, within the framework of the Peace Formula, sends exactly this signal to the aggressor state. There will be peace. Aggression loses. It is very important that every week Russia sees new international activity in support of Ukraine and normal life. Today, I want to give special thanks to several countries that this week took new steps for greater security, greater protection of our people. First of all, Germany. Two additional Patriot launchers, it is very important. Thank you! Thank you, Germany, thank you, people, thank you, Olaf! Every significant strengthening of our air defense means thousands of saved lives and a real approach to a full-fledged air shield for Ukraine. Every city, every village must be protected. This will become the basis of a pan-European air shield. When Russian terror loses in Ukraine, all of Europe will win. This week, our border guards received mobile medical complexes from the Netherlands. In general, the Netherlands is among the leaders in defense cooperation with Ukraine, in political cooperation. They really protect life. And the humanitarian dimension is also meaningful. I thank the people of the Netherlands for that! Thank you all! Mark, thank you! Azerbaijan is ready to provide a new humanitarian support package, including demining equipment. This is also one of the key directions of our work with partners – demining. Ukraine also needs equipment from partners, and it is very crucial to create a production base in Ukraine so that we can clear our land of Russian mines. And this task should be completed not in decades, but in years. In total, as of now, 174,000 square kilometers of our country are potentially dangerous due to mines and unexploded ammunition. Every day, our specialists detect hundreds of explosive objects. And the more we have demining machines, the more special drones we have for demining, the more actively we would be able to restore security. Thankful to every country that helps us! And today I would like to thank all our specialists engaged in demining. They really work on the ground. Fields, the territory of settlements, power lines, infrastructure facilities are demined. Last day, 133 pyrotechnic units worked across the country. Most of them are in Kherson, Kharkiv, and Donetsk regions. I thank you – each who cleanses the Ukrainian land from the traces of Russian terror! I would especially like to mention a few specialists. This is Anton Volos, a deminer of the pyrotechnic works department, Bohdan Olshevsky, a driver-mechanic-deminer. They both work in the emergency and rescue squad of the Emergency Service of Luhansk region. Thanks, guys! Serhiy Siroshtan, head of the pyrotechnic works group, the Main Department of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Kherson region. Thank you, Serhiy! Police officers: lieutenant colonel Valentyn Melnyk, lieutenant colonel Ihor Pidlisny, colonel Yaroslav Kostiv. They took turns leading groups of the explosive engineering service – 10-15 groups – in Kharkiv region. From September 22 until now – in the territory liberated from the occupiers. Very active. Thank you! And very effective. Thank you to everyone who works for the security of Ukraine and Ukrainians! Thank you to everyone who fights for our country – Bakhmut, Avdiyivka, Shakhtarsk direction, Kupiansk, southern directions. Glory to you, warriors! Glory to all who destroy the occupier! Glory to all who support Ukraine, support Ukrainians! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russian terrorists must feel only one thing: they will be destroyed - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-13</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today, Russian invaders brutally attacked Kherson region. There are dead and wounded. At 4 am, the village of Veletenske was shelled. A house caught fire. A guy was wounded: he has severe burns, he is now in an intensive care unit. 9 am - the occupiers attacked the village of Shyroka Balka. They used artillery. Five people were killed. Among them was a baby girl, 22 days old. Her brother, who was only 12 years old, was taken to the hospital. Unfortunately, they could not save him. He died from severe wounds. The children&#x27;s mother - her name was Olesia, she was only 39 years old - died. My condolences! Around the same time, the village of Stanislav was shelled. Two people were wounded, two were killed. The men were 71 years old and 57 years old. In total, from the beginning of this day until 6 pm, there have already been 17 reports of shelling from Kherson region alone. Other regions include Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Donbas, Kharkiv, the border areas with Russia in the northeast. Everywhere our warriors retaliate against the occupiers&#x27; terror. There is not a single day when Russian evil does not get our completely fair retaliation. Every occupier destroyed, every piece of Russian equipment burned, fire instead of their headquarters and warehouses, the very eloquent smoke on Kerch bridge and more - all this proves that we will not leave any of Russia&#x27;s crimes unanswered. And each of our warriors who gives Ukraine results on the frontline - along the entire frontline from Kharkiv to Kherson - each of our warriors has the opportunity to bring justice to Ukraine. Everyone who helps our warriors. Now there are only two personal lines of behavior: either you fight for Ukraine, or you help fight and save lives. Today, there is much to thank the 95th separate airborne assault brigade for: their resilience and results in the battles in the Kupyansk sector. Well done, warriors! Powerful. The 1st battalion of the 67th separate mechanized brigade, also in the Kupyansk sector, acted heroically and courageously. Thank you! The paratroopers of our glorious &quot;Seventy-ninth&quot; in the Maryinka sector - thank you, warriors! Melitopol and Berdyansk direction - I thank every warrior who gives Ukraine the necessary results! Bakhmut direction - well done, guys! Every time we have something to thank our warriors for, Ukraine becomes closer to justice, closer to victory. And Russian murderers on our land become closer to destruction. This is the only way we can create the conditions for the whole of Ukraine to become free and safe again. Russian terrorists must feel only one thing: they will be destroyed. And one more thing. Behind every report of shelling and injuries of our people, there are stories of heroism of our Ukrainian doctors and nurses working in the frontline areas.

Not a single day should be wasted! At the front, in the areas near the front, everywhere in the rear, and, very importantly, by every diplomatic mission of Ukraine. Weapons for our warriors, support for our state, and legal responsibility for Russian terrorists. Ukraine will definitely prevail! But this will be our common result. Of all those who are fighting and working for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Those who are not fighting on the frontline must help fight - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-14</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Since early morning today, I have been in Donetsk region, in the positions of our combat brigades. The 3rd and 5th separate assault brigades, the &quot;Eightieth&quot; airborne assault brigade, the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade, the 22nd and 24th separate mechanized brigades, the 26th separate artillery brigade, the 92nd separate mechanized brigade... I had the honor to award the best, to thank everyone - each brigade - for their bravery, courage, and results for the sake of Ukraine. Together with General Bohomolov, commander of the Soledar operational and tactical group, we talked to the brigade and battalion commanders - those who are in combat - about their frontline needs. There is always an overall picture, there are reports on each direction, on each brigade. But it is important to talk directly to the warriors about the war experience of those who are on the ground. Today we had detailed, frank conversations. We talked about our offensive, about supplies to the troops, about the capabilities of commanders, about what these capabilities are now and what they should be. Weapons and scarce ammunition. Repair of equipment. A pressing issue is transportation to evacuate the wounded and the time of evacuation. Drones used by the enemy: Lancets, Orlans. Drones needed by our warriors: from Mavics to every other drone system. Obviously, the Ukrainian production of drones - Leleka, Fury, etc. - as well as supplies from partners and all forms of imports - must grow, and this is one of the most important tasks. It is very important that all officials in the defense system perceive this task exactly as it is said on the frontline. Drones are consumables, and there should be as many of them as needed - as our warriors need - to save lives and ensure results in battles. There is much to be done in this area, and it is too early to say that we are doing enough. An important topic is how commanders can manage their personnel. Motivation of warriors, training of warriors, manning of units. There are a lot of problems due to the poor performance of the military medical commissions... Military commanders should be engaged in war, not bureaucracy. We will develop solutions. Another thing that was voiced today in different brigades. Warriors from the frontline who come to the rear cities deserve to see and feel that these are rear cities. That people live there, remembering that there are warriors there, that our warriors here in Donetsk and other directions are fighting for Ukraine, giving their lives for Ukraine. Freedom and independence are not gained by someone there... at the front. This is a common national cause of all those who are fighting and working for victory. Everyone is at war. Ukraine is at war. And those who are not fighting on the frontline must help fight. Not in bars, not in clubs, not by street racing or some kind of ostentatious consumption, but by helping the warriors in a very specific way. To say the least of it. All the country&#x27;s adrenaline, all the country&#x27;s emotions, all the country&#x27;s strength should be there - in the battles for the sake of the state. For the sake of Ukraine is the key principle. For the sake of something else or for the sake of ourselves will be later, when we win. And now it is defense. Now it is war. By the way, I am grateful to the United States today for the new package. We got munitions for Patriots, for HIMARS, artillery, Javelins etc. These are much-needed supplies. We will soon be doing more work with our partners for the sake of defense. Thank you to everyone - everyone who is constantly helping! Glory to all our warriors! Glory to our strong people! And thank you to our Donetsk region for this day. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Feedback from our battalion commanders on combat use of equipment and weapons is what we will discuss with the leaders of partner states - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-15</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! All our warriors! Today I continue to visit our combat brigades. Yesterday we were in Donetsk region, today - various districts of Zaporizhzhia region, the territory of the Tavria operational and strategic group of troops. Together with General Tarnavskyi, we visited the positions of the 3rd and 15th operational brigades of the National Guard, the 47th and 65th separate mechanized brigades, the 46th airmobile brigade; the 10th Army Corps - the 116th, 117th and 118th brigades. Each one is special, all of them are doing great. I also visited the frontline surgical unit and thanked our combat medics for saving Ukrainian lives. I spoke with the brigade commanders and battalion commanders about the needs of our warriors - what they really feel on the frontline. Everything the guys talked about will be voiced at the Staff. When such communication takes place brigade by brigade, and everyone has real combat experience, we can assess the situation much more deeply, see how the specific experience of one brigade can be applied by other units and scaled up to our entire defense forces. Specific needs have been defined: electronic warfare equipment, drones, and medevac armored evacuation vehicles. There are additional organizational issues that were not discussed yesterday, in particular, regarding officer ranks. Training of soldiers is one of the key tasks, we talked about it. Real combat experience, current challenges and trends on the battlefield, fire and maneuver, the skills that our warriors have and that need to be shared with all brigades and made a priority in training centers, especially when training mobilized soldiers. Soldiers&#x27; training is also the responsibility of every commander at all levels. Motivation of people is important, and it is a direct consequence of how they learn to fight. We heard from the battalion commanders about combat use of equipment and weapons provided by our partners. Each such feedback is something we will discuss with the leaders. And I would like to thank all our warriors who take trophies and put Russian equipment to work for Ukraine. This is not just the rationality of our guys, this is also an important proof of the ability of our heroes to take weapons from the enemy and use them to protect the life of Ukraine. I was honored to award our warriors - soldiers, sergeants, officers... I am proud of everyone! Thank you, guys, for your chevrons. It&#x27;s a pleasure! Today I would like to thank everyone who helped eliminate the consequences of Russian missile attacks. Yesterday it was in Odesa and Kharkiv region, and today it was in Lviv, Lutsk, Dnipro, Kramatorsk, Cherkasy region, Zaporizhzhia region and other parts of the country. I am grateful to the rescuers, doctors, police, volunteers, local authorities... Thank you! Every day we must remember that the steps forward of our warriors on the frontline bring security and protection closer to all our cities and villages. And the more powerful our air defense system is, the more opportunities the rear regions have to work for defense. In particular, we are already increasing military production, even in the current conditions. And we will further increase it. Ukraine&#x27;s goal is clear: we will win and provide Ukraine with the power to guarantee a lasting peace. And I thank each and every one of our warriors - everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! I am grateful to all the volunteers who help, to each and every one of them. To all Ukrainians who feel that they are at war and therefore help the defense. Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everything that was mentioned in our combat brigades is now the job of the General Staff, government officials and the Staff - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-16</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff today. Frontline issues that are currently important. Defense issues that are strategically important. The commanders reported on the situation in the eastern and southern directions. The Commander-in-Chief and the Ministry of Defense spoke about munitions. Deputy Prime Minister Fedorov and the State Special Communications Service spoke about drones and our technological capabilities in general. In each combat brigade, warriors first ask about drones, electronic warfare, and military air defense. The answer to such questions is our work with partners to supply the necessary drones and systems, and our work here in Ukraine. Production is necessary. We are increasing production significantly. However, we need to systematize what is already being supplied to the troops and used. Drones are the &quot;eyes&quot; and protection on the frontline. Of different ranges, for different purposes. Drones are a guarantee that people will not have to pay with their lives when drones can be used. Basically, everything we&#x27;ve recently talked about with the boys in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, in our combat brigades, is now the job of the General Staff, government officials, and the Staff. The tasks are clear. I also had a long meeting today regarding our international activities now, in the second half of August. New defense packages. New political decisions for Ukraine. Support for our country and people. This August should be fruitful for Ukraine - this is a task for the entire team of our country, for each and every one who works for the success of Ukraine. Today, we have something to recognize our warriors for. The 80th separate airborne assault brigade - thank you, guys, for your strength near Bakhmut! It is an exemplary force that we can only be proud of. The &quot;Fury&quot; joint assault brigade of the National Police - thank you, warriors, for your success! Areas of responsibility of the Tavria operational and strategic group of troops. The 23rd separate mechanized brigade, the marines of the 35th and 36th brigades, the artillerymen of the 44th brigade - thank you all for the very good results for Ukraine! Well done, warriors! Do not reduce your power for a single day! I would like to recognize Ukrainian rescuers today. Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Odesa regions, our ports. Everywhere where there have been Russian strikes this day and beyond. It is very important that our people help each other, take care of the victims, and always save lives everywhere and under any circumstances. I am grateful to all the employees of the State Emergency Service, medics and police, all the military who are helping, local authorities and volunteers who are working for the sake of people and Ukraine. Every act of help now is a manifestation of our common strength, not only our faith, but also our strong belief that Ukraine will withstand, pull through all this and emerge victorious. And one more thing. Something that everyone in the world should hear and see now. Last night, Russian terrorists again targeted our ports. Our infrastructure, which is involved in ensuring not ours, but the common - global - food security. In just one month since Russia&#x27;s attempt to undermine the Black Sea Grain Initiative, this was the seventh, seventh massive Russian attack today. The port of Reni, the port of Izmail, Pivdennyi port, the port of Odesa, the port of Chornomorsk, Mykolaiv - every Russian attack on them is a blow to global food prices, a blow to social and political stability in Africa and Asia. The basic things that give every society a normal life are food on the family table. No terrorist in the world, except for Russia, has ever attacked the security of so many nations at once so blatantly and deliberately. We need to respond to this. All of us! We need to counteract this - actively, with joint efforts! I thank all the leaders and states that help Ukraine defend our country, and thus the common security of everyone in the world. Air defense systems for Ukraine, weapons for our warriors, sanctions, financial and political pressure on Russia are the main things now that guarantee security and the return of peace not just to one country, but to the whole world. Glory to our warriors! Glory to our indomitable and strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are building the arsenal of the free world together - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-17</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on this day. First. The frontline. I started the day with a conference call with the military, intelligence, and government officials. The situation on the frontline. Defense of positions, advancement - our offensive actions. Supplies for the warriors. We are actively shaping the content of new defense packages from our partners. More news to come. Second. Today I would like to highlight our cooperation with Germany. Step by step, our agreements with Mr. Chancellor Scholz are being implemented. Two new IRIS-T launching stations have been delivered to Ukraine. This is a powerful and much-needed air defense system. Thank you, Germany, for your help in protecting us from Russian terror! Third. Traditionally, in St. Sophia of Kyiv, I accepted credentials from new ambassadors who arrived in Ukraine. Germany, Indonesia, Sweden, Chile, Colombia, Peru. Of course, I spoke with all the new ambassadors today. Fourth. Several substantive meetings with the government. A separate meeting with Prime Minister Shmyhal. Logistics for Ukraine, for our manufacturers. Export issues. Additional support for our defense. Strengthening Ukraine together with our neighbors in the European Union. Then, an expanded meeting with the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Strategic Industries, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the relevant deputy heads of the Office. We discussed the Defense Industries Forum. We are planning this event for the autumn. It will be the first time such a large-scale event will be held at the state level. Ukrainian and foreign arms manufacturers. Our power. The power of our partners. The entire world, which is interested in ensuring that international law and humanity have an appropriate arsenal of defense against any terror... The world can be united by this format of cooperation as well. We plan the forum to be the first track record of our defense industry. To demonstrate what we already know how to produce. To consider what we can add to our capabilities, in particular through the creation of new production facilities in Ukraine, through localization with partners. And, of course, we have to give a new security impetus to everyone in the world who values their statehood and freedom as much as we do. Nations have the right to defense. We are building the arsenal of the free world together. The fifth one for today. As always. I am grateful to all those who are fighting for Ukraine and working for its defense. Thank you to each and every one! I would like to particularly mention the warriors of the 117th separate mechanized brigade. Orikhiv direction. Thank you for your strength, warriors! There is much to be grateful for to the special forces who defend the northern regions of our country. Junior Sergeant Kyrylo Melnyk and Captain Artem Chastikov - thank you guys! The 3rd operational brigade of the National Guard, the 66th separate howitzer artillery division of the 406th brigade and the 3rd artillery division of the 44th brigade. Thank you all, warriors, for your accuracy and ability to destroy the occupiers. And it is once again an honor for me to recognize the warriors of the 36th separate marine brigade. Thank you! Glory to all our heroes! And a few other things. Today, by my decree, the NSDC&#x27;s decision on the results of the inspection of military commissars and the work of recruitment centers in general has been put into effect. The leadership will be completely replaced. Warriors who have actually been in combat, who really understand how and who should be selected for our defense and security forces - these are the warriors who will manage the work of territorial recruitment centers. This system needs dignity. This system needs rationality. This system needs the ability to provide the frontline with people who can reinforce our defense. In every combat brigade I visited this week - 16 in total - warriors talked about problems with recruitment. These problems begin with the way military enlistment offices work. Their work must change. And it will. Thanks to combat officers. I have just signed one of the key laws that Ukraine needs to start negotiations with the European Union on our country&#x27;s accession. Negotiations are to start this year. The law guarantees a transparent, professional and fair selection of judges of the Constitutional Court. Our country is one step closer to joining the European Union. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are preparing powerful things to strengthen our state, our warriors – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-18</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! Today is Friday, but it&#x27;s such a week that it&#x27;s too early to sum up the working days. We are preparing powerful things for Ukraine, strengthening our state, our warriors. Today and this week in general, it is the main task. Weapons for our warriors. New opportunities for our defense. New support packages from our partners. We are doing everything so that on the eve of the Independence Day of our country, it can be said that Ukraine has taken another step towards the circle of the strongest states in the world. Our team is currently working particularly intensively. You will see the news for Ukraine. We prepare them with our neighbors in the EU. And also in those regions of Europe where our cooperation with the states has not yet been sufficient. And, of course, with our European partners, with whom we have already proved more than once that European leadership in defending freedom is of global importance. By the way, we have already had important diplomatic successes this week. The G7 Declaration on security guarantees for Ukraine: as of today, 18 states have joined. The Peace Formula: already 63 diplomatic missions are working to implement the points of the Formula. It is crucial that the Peace Formula gradually unites the world majority based on our respect for international law and the UN Charter. The European Union: we are trying our best to make Ukraine ready for the opening of membership negotiations this year. Today, the day started with a meaningful conference call. As always, the front is the first question. Military reports. The situation is on the front line. Reports of government officials regarding the supply of weapons and ammunition. The report of the Security Service of Ukraine regarding military commissioners and collaborators... Separately, I listened to the report of the Border Guard Service, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, intelligence regarding the attitude towards our citizens – immigrants who are in different countries, and regarding visa regimes. The things that citizens of Ukraine actually face in the visa issue. Managers in charge of these issues received appropriate tasks. The rights of Ukrainian citizens must be guaranteed. And one more. Next week is the time of important events for Ukraine. We will not lose a single day of preparation. We will not miss any result for Ukraine. We work every day. Every day we add strength to Ukraine. And I thank everyone who does the same! For Ukraine – only strength! Glory to all our warriors! Glory to everyone who works for victory! For the sake of freedom and independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Step by step, we are getting closer to Swedish Gripen aircraft appearing in our skies – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-20</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today, we are working all day in Sweden, now we are finishing the day in Stockholm. Weapons for our warriors are the main thing. There are results, and they are much needed results. Armored vehicles – СV90, cool vehicles. Just what is needed at the front. Not only supply from partners – although we are accelerating it – but also production in Ukraine. Our production. New production. There is an agreement with Sweden on the production of СV90 in our country. Everything powerful that serves us now, we must localize and produce. We will do so. The second is Archer systems for our gunners. Our boys are already studying in Sweden. The powerful system, the necessary system. We are working to have more of them in Ukraine. The third is modern aviation. We are trying very, very hard to increase the capabilities of military aviation. This is one of the hardest tasks, but I am sure: we will accomplish it. Now, we have a breakthrough result regarding Gripen fighters – cool, modern Swedish combat aircraft. Our soldiers are already starting to test them. And we are step by step, negotiation by negotiation, we are getting closer to the fact that Gripen fighters will appear in our sky. Today, in particular, I talked about this with the Prime Minister of Sweden, with representatives of the Swedish parliamentary parties. Thank you for understanding our needs! We are working on the beginning of the stage with the training of our boys on Gripen fighters. We will discuss the details. Today, there was a good and meaningful audience with King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia – I visited them together with Olena. Grateful for the support of Ukraine and our people, grateful for the understanding of what Ukrainians have to go through now. Today, various leaders, representatives of states, and international organizations condemned yet another extremely vile Russian attack on Ukraine, on our Chernihiv. I am grateful to everyone in the world who today expressed condolences to Ukraine, our people. Unfortunately, seven people died in Chernihiv from a Russian missile, among them is a girl, her name was Sofia, she was six years old... My condolences to the relatives! There are 144 wounded and injured, including 15 children. The missile just hit the center of the city. And this is on the feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord, an Orthodox holiday. A total of 140 people performed the rescue operation. Doctors, emergency services, military, local authorities – everyone helped. Thank you to everyone who saved the lives of children, adults – everyone. And I would especially like to mention the emergency paramedics Liudmyla Kopysh and Viacheslav Prokhorenko, the employees of the State Emergency Service Serhiy Kostenko, Vladyslav Sokolenko, Yuriy Ovrutsky, Valeriy Morhatsky, Oleksiy Marchenko and Viktor Dovzhenko, and policemen Andriy Vovk and Andriy Zeliak. Thanks to all of you! I am sure: our soldiers will respond to Russia for this terrorist attack. Respond tangibly. Glory to all who protect our state and our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine believed in Denmark when the evil invasion began, and I thank you for trusting us – President&#x27;s speech to the members of the Folketing</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-21</span></div>
  <p>Mister Speaker, Madam Prime Minister! Mette! Dear members of Folketing and government, diplomats! Everyone who is here today. And, of course, journalists! Those who make possible that one nation, a great nation, hears in a very concrete, very important moment, the soul of another. Dear people of Denmark! Today I am here with my wife, with my team. We are here to say: thank you. Personally thank all of you for helping us in our fight, difficult fight for freedom. For helping us in this war, which Russia brought to our land and which it wants so much – still wants! – to throw into homes of other nations. I&#x27;m sure you can see that. Now, Russian evil strikes with pain and death at Ukrainian cities and villages. But they openly say that Ukraine is not enough. Later, after our country, they want to carry the suffering further to Europe and to the world. I&#x27;m sure you hear it – you hear it from Moscow. All of Russia’s neighbors are under threat – if Ukraine does not prevail. International law will not be resuscitated. Democracies of the world – each of them can become a target either for missiles, or for mercenaries, or for destabilization. I’m sure you can feel it. But! Ukraine will prevail! I want you to see it, hear it, feel it. Ukraine will prevail! And these are not just words. It is a fact that follows from what we believe in. We! Ukrainians. Danes. All Europeans. Every nation that stands with us. Stands against blows. The blows of the war. And will stand further! When Putin ordered this invasion, he only believed in the length of his armored vehicles’ columns. In power of explosions of Russian missiles. He believed that cruelty is capable of rewriting the history of an entire continent. Erasing this history. Pushing it back a century. Yes, to crush everything that makes our continent and our countries peaceful. He believed only in force, in force without humanity, he trusted violence, and that is why he is weaker. We believe in something completely different. And that is why we become stronger. All of us! Together with you! We believe in human solidarity. And, in fact, it allows us to destroy any column of any equipment of any occupier. Because when you have people on your side, when humanity is a value for you, and when your values match the values of other nations, – you will definitely find all the necessary weapons to defend yourself how we do, how we defend ourselves. In particular, with your help. I thank you on behalf of all Ukrainians, all of us! Thank you, Denmark, for your solidarity! Thank you for all the help provided to Ukraine! Thank you for Harpoons! Russians are afraid of them. Thank you for Caesars, Leopards and Bradleys, drones – yes, they are afraid of drones – and artillery, and thank you for demining machines. All this serves freedom! Serves at this very moment! Serves to protect people’s lives. People, life – this is what we believe in. When you defend people’s right to life, you are joined by others who value life. And this makes you together invincible! I thank you, Denmark, for helping Ukraine to become invincible! Ukraine is moving from Javelins and Stingers to Patriots and F-16s. F-16s. Thank you, Denmark, for F-16s! There was a time when they said that this would never happen. When they said we shouldn&#x27;t fight. When they didn&#x27;t believe in us, didn&#x27;t believe in you, didn&#x27;t believe in people, and said that it was easier to freeze the desire to live. But humanity turned into solidarity. Solidarity turned into leadership. In particular, your leadership, Denmark. And it is leadership that multiplies our collective strength. People value strength. Strength helps. But strength is not always primary. Strength is a consequence. Consequence of who you are. And who is with you. Whom you respect. And who respects you. Whom you want to see in your home. And who wants to see you. Whom you trust. And who trusts you. We trust you, Denmark. Thank you! Full-scale Russian evil is retreating now under the blows of those whom Russia has always only despised. And despising was wrong. But people are not being wrong now when they despise it – such Russia. Which spreads evil. Which does not even distinguish between whom to kill – a child or a soldier. Which wants to change the law with violence. Which went against us. Which went against all of us. And to which we together give one answer: we will prevail! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear people of Denmark! Ukraine believed in you when this evil invasion began. And I thank you for trusting us. When I addressed you online for the first time from Kyiv in March 2022, and when no one could yet say what would happen next, my address was based on confidence. On confidence in you. I asked for leadership, and you are the leaders. I asked for support in overcoming this disaster brought by the war, and you support Ukraine with everything that is needed. I addressed you saying that we need to think not only about war – we know there will be peace, we know we can get back to normal life. To what we liked and what we loved. And I am grateful to you for the fact that you are already helping Ukraine with reconstruction. Thank you, Mette! In particular, to our city of Mykolaiv, over which Denmark took patronage. You well deliver on your promise. Thank you! I addressed you at the beginning of the full-scale war, but I already knew that you would not give in to fear. And you defend your principles, our values and the future of Europe. Free, peaceful and, what is really important, united. Europe, in which we will always be united only by cooperation. Within the European Union. Within NATO. And cooperation between us – on a bilateral level. And we will never be divided by the evil of any occupation or any totalitarian curtain. Because we will always protect our freedom and never lose our faith – faith in people, in humanity and in each other. We will always help each other to prevail, no matter what happens! And let this be another of our Copenhagen criteria… The criteria of those who win! Thank you, Denmark! Thank you to your great people – almost our relatives! Thank you for our refugees!

  <h2>With our victory and cooperation we will prove that people matter, freedom matters, Europe matters – Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s speech to the public of Ukraine and Denmark</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-21</span></div>
  <p>Thank you! Thank you, Speaker! It is a great honor to be here! Thank you for everything, great people of Denmark! Thank you so much! Hi! Hi, Copenhagen! Dear people of Denmark! Dear Mette, Madam Prime Minister! I remember how you visited Kyiv, our capital, on the 21st of April 2022. I will say frankly these were harsh days for Ukraine. For all our people, children, for everybody. At that time, we had already decided everything for ourselves and fought how we could. But then, the world had not yet chosen how to act. And the Ukrainians had not yet known who in the world would actually be with us. As long as it takes and as true allies. Like Denmark! Like each and every one of you. Here, at this square, and in every Danish family, in every home, where you wish us victory in this battle for freedom just as we wish it! I thank you all! Today, almost a year and a half after your visit to Ukraine, Madam Prime Minister, we can openly say that the majority of the world is like Denmark – now with us. We feel it. It’s a great support for us. When the first Russian missiles hit our cities, warning the world about the full-scale war in the middle of Europe, the risk was simply insane. The risk that Europe will again lose itself, as it had already happened in our history. It was a risk that tyranny would win again. It was a risk that the culture would lose again. And the worst thing is that respect, which is the basis of our free and united Europe, could be destroyed. Respect for every nation, for every community, for every person. When Europe is not ruled by respect, dictatorships would dominate Europe. And we saved our Europe from this. Saved together! What is the price of life? War always raises this question. It is true. When I spoke to our soldiers on the front lines, they told me about the motivation of Russian occupiers. Russian soldiers are less afraid of being killed in the battle than they are afraid of stopping aggression and returning home. A free person can even hardly imagine that. Imagine what Russia is today, if its people fear their return home more than to be killed at war. This is the worst thing tyranny does to its people – it eliminates the value of life, totally. We will never allow Ukraine or any other country to become the same territory of disrespect for people, life, and human diversity, as the Russian state has become and wants to make other countries. We have to always remember what stands against us. And until the victory comes, we have to act the way we do with you, Denmark! When Ukraine needs weapons, you – help. I thank you and the whole of Denmark – all the weapons you’re giving to protect freedom and for F-16s we agreed on. Thank you so much! When Russian missiles hit our power plants last winter to drive Ukraine into blackout and defeat, you helped us to live through winter. When it was needed to accommodate our people, you provided them with very generous opportunities. Thank you very much! Thank you for your attitude to our people, to Ukrainians! To all your families, all your houses, all your people, all your cities! Thank you very much, Denmark! And when I asked you about support for our port city and region of Mykolaiv, which endlessly suffers from the Russian terror – you gave such support without delay… Thank you! Thank all of you! Dear friends! Today we are confident that Russia will lose this war. But this is not the only main thing. The main is what we prove with our victory, with our cooperation, what you prove supporting Ukraine. Together we prove that life is a value, that people matter, freedom matters, Europe matters. I’m sure it will be written in history also due to you, being with Ukraine. I’m sure that we will win because truth is on our side. All our people are waiting for this moment. It will be a common victory of truth, of democracy, of our nations. Thank you very much for your support! After the victory we’ll come to you! Maybe, it’s not traditional to hear it from the President but I want to say it. Yes, we will come to you, sit together somewhere and we’ll say “Skål.” Jeg takker jer Danmark! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>We are completing a historic visit to the Nordic countries with much-needed agreements - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-21</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We are completing this visit to the Nordic countries. Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark. Without exaggeration, this is a historic visit for Ukraine. Crucial agreements with Sweden. In particular, defense agreements. We will produce CV-90, powerful combat vehicles, in Ukraine. Our warriors are very satisfied with these vehicles. Mr. Kristersson, the entire Government of Sweden, all Swedish people... Thank you! The Netherlands – as always, productive. This time, particularly. We can get 42 F-16 jets for Ukraine. We will get them. I thank you, Mark, Prime Minister, your entire team, and the people of the Netherlands! Denmark – 19 more F-16s, plus we are expanding our training. Thank you, Denmark! Dear Mette, Madam Prime Minister, the entire government team... Folketing! Thank you very much! It was an honor for me to address the Danish Parliament. I thank the powerful people of Denmark. Our common priority - of all Europeans - is that all peoples on all continents can equally enjoy a secure life. The more stability there is in the world, the more stability there is in our European home. In all three countries, we discussed new defense support packages for the warriors, political cooperation and Peace Formula. I would like to express special gratitude to Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark for supporting the Peace Formula. Peace is always the result of joint efforts, it is always security in all spheres of life. And we will achieve it: for Ukraine, for the world. Russia will not be able to undermine global security. Separately, I would like to thank the United States of America for supporting our freedom and our aviation coalition. The F-16 is an aircraft made by the United States. It is very important that President Biden, his team... especially through the efforts of his National Security Advisor Sullivan, both parties of the US Congress, millions and millions of Americans support us in the battle for freedom, for independence, for our people... Thank you, America! The work of politicians is unity. More unity. More power. When unity grows stronger, even things that seemed fantastic to someone before become possible. Ukraine will have F-16s. We are not stopping. We will be giving more strength to our country. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everything in our country should become an assistant to a veteran, just as it is an assistant to a warrior today - President&#x27;s address to the participants of the VI International Veterans Forum</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-22</span></div>
  <p>Glory to Ukraine! Dear defenders of Ukraine! Dear Ukrainian people! It is very important and symbolic that the Veterans Forum is opening on the eve of the Ukrainian Independence Day. There would be no independence if it wasn&#x27;t for our warriors. All of our soldiers and sailors, sergeants and petty officers, officers and generals at war are at the heart of Ukrainian independence. And this is the first priority of the state policy - to give our warriors everything necessary. Necessary to fight. Necessary to win. That&#x27;s why we work 24/7 to provide the best weapons in the world for Ukraine&#x27;s warriors. Now, the visits during these days resulted in at least four new defense packages from our partners, and the main thing we have achieved is the unlocking of F-16 deliveries to our country. We have agreed on a specific number of the first delivery of aircraft - from two countries, the Netherlands and Denmark. And we are working on an even greater result. I met with our men and women who have already started training in Denmark. Ukrainian pilots and engineers will also begin training in other countries of the aviation coalition - we are expanding our training programs. And all our warriors of the sky are highly motivated to use the new combat aircraft for our country as soon as possible. In terms of combat aviation performance, Ukraine will be among the top strongest countries in the world. This means that we will be able to save more lives of our people. Both military and civilian. And all the bilateral meetings that I am holding now in the framework of the Ukraine-Balkans Summit – Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Moldova, other meetings with other leaders – all of them strengthen Ukraine, all of them help our country become much closer to our strategic goals. Dear Ukrainians! As long as our country is on the path of the war for freedom and independence, it is the duty of every person to do everything possible, and sometimes impossible, to make Ukraine stronger. I am grateful to all those in the country for whom this principle is the first and foremost. A lot depends on a person&#x27;s simple initiative. On the ability not to miss an opportunity for Ukraine. On the ability to convince for the sake of Ukraine. On the ability to hear and see what can be done now to make it easier for Ukraine to fight. Ukrainians demonstrate such initiative. Among those present at the Veterans Forum are many who have made significant personal achievements for Ukraine and know for sure that often everything depends on one person. On a person&#x27;s care. On a person&#x27;s determination. On how dedicated a person is to the cause and the defense of Ukraine. Unfortunately, in this terrible war, we lost thousands of the most dedicated. Thousands of the bravest and most caring. Those who stood up to defend Ukraine in 2014. Those who stood up to defend the state after February 24. And now I ask all Ukrainians to observe a minute of silence in memory of all the warriors who gave their lives for the sake of Ukraine&#x27;s independence. Thank you. This year we have established a new Ukrainian policy - the policy of heroes. The policy of honoring and creating opportunities for all our warriors, for all our veterans, thanks to whom Ukraine is alive. To implement such a policy, decisions are needed. We all realize the scope of these decisions. And the responsibility for their implementation. Today, at the Forum, government officials will present a package of decisions that are of utmost importance for our veterans to be able to integrate into social life with dignity after returning from the war. People always come back from war changed. And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s especially difficult - after everything you&#x27;ve been through, after everything you&#x27;ve experienced, after all the losses you&#x27;ve seen... It&#x27;s especially difficult to build a life. But you are heroes! You are needed! Ukraine needs you! Each and every one of you. Those who are fighting for Ukraine. Who brought and is bringing Ukraine&#x27;s victory closer. Millions of people are fighting and working to ensure that Ukraine prevails and defends itself. We need everyone of these millions! No lost lives! No lost generations! No lost opportunities! And, of course, no lost time. The time of life. These are the main principles underlying the policy of heroes. Everything in it - from honoring the heroic deeds of Ukrainians to new educational opportunities for veterans, from the quality of the work of the military medical commissions and rehabilitation to economic opportunities, business and legal opportunities, housing for veterans - everything in the policy of heroes should help people live. Any official who does not understand this will be replaced. Any regulations that cause a delay should be simplified. Everything in our country, one way or another, should become an assistant to a veteran, just as it is today an assistant to a warrior. And all effective initiatives of the state and the public, very importantly, of business, very importantly, of veterans themselves, all initiatives aimed at improving the quality of Ukraine&#x27;s policy of heroes, at integrating and helping veterans must be implemented. The Intercession, the Day of Defenders of Ukraine, is ahead. It is on this day that we should see and evaluate the results. This is the first significant result of the implementation of the policy of heroes and the solution of the problems that will be discussed, in particular, today at the Forum. I am confident that there will be a result. It has to be. Glory to all Ukrainian warriors! Glory to all our veterans! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The overall summary of these days is that Ukraine has become stronger - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-22</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on our activities these days. Four visits: Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece. The Ukraine-Balkans Summit. Negotiations on the margins of the summit with Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Moldova, and the President of the European Commission. We are coming home with new political support and new agreements. Everyone clearly confirms the territorial integrity of Ukraine. There will be jets for Ukraine. There will be additional armored vehicles. We will reinforce air defense. Economy, our exports, European and Euro-Atlantic integration. Almost every meeting touched upon the protection of export routes across the Black Sea and through the &quot;solidarity lanes&quot; on land. A very important agreement with Greece, for which I am particularly grateful to the Prime Minister, is Greece&#x27;s willingness to take patronage over the recovery of our Odesa. The decision is not only substantive, but also very symbolic. It is filled with many historical and cultural meanings. The overall summary of these days is that Ukraine has become stronger. I would also like to mention Luxembourg today - thank you for joining the G7 declaration on security guarantees. Every week adds new security opportunities for us. I am grateful to our entire team that is working for this! And one more thing. The annual veterans&#x27; forum was held in Kyiv. I was honored to open it with my address. I hope that all government officials participating in the forum will listen carefully to the needs and suggestions of our veteran community. The Ukrainian policy of heroes, that is, the Ukrainian veteran policy, must be effective. And it will be. This is the responsibility of every relevant official. I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia caused the isolation of Crimea, we will return the whole world to Crimea - President&#x27;s speech at the third Crimea Platform Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-23</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear guests! Dear participants of the Crimea Platform! I welcome all of you. It is an honor to meet you all today. But before I open this summit, which is already the third summit of our Crimea Platform, I want to tell you about a girl. She is a citizen of Ukraine and a Crimean Tatar. She is 25 years old. She has a very nice, loving family. And in the family she is affectionately called Bojek. In Crimean Tatar, it means &quot;bug&quot;. She is of small stature, a very kind and sincere daughter of her parents. Her father is seriously ill. Unfortunately, he has cancer - terminal cancer. She tried to go to her father. Just to support him, just to help him as a child. Or at least to see him. Just to see him... None of us can know how much time in life each of us really has. But we all know and feel that every day with our loved ones is true happiness. Happiness that cannot be deprived of. This girl&#x27;s name is Leniye Umerova. She has been imprisoned for more than six months. Now she is in Moscow. In a pre-trial detention center. And this is one of the toughest pre-trial detention centers in Russia. The only connection this girl, Leniye, has with her family is her letters. The short letters she can rarely send to freedom from behind bars. Her so-called &quot;crime&quot; against Russia is that she tried to visit her sick father in occupied Crimea. And now Russia wants to sentence her to 20 years in prison. An ordinary girl. And this is just one of the many examples of the occupiers&#x27; repression of Ukrainian citizens in Crimea, of the Crimean Tatar people, a strong, great people, and of the Muslim community of Crimea. Men and women, the young and the elderly... They are different, these people, really. Someone was a journalist and told the truth. For Russia, this is a crime. Someone was an activist and fought for the truth for his people. Someone just wanted to freely practice their faith. Someone tried to bring the end of the occupation closer. And for Russia, all of these are the same crimes... Just like the desire to simply be with your family in your native Crimea without regard to the occupier. Dear participants of the Crimea Platform! It depends on our solidarity when Leniye Umerova, Nariman Celâl Vladyslav Yesypenko, Server Mustafayev, Iryna Danylovych and many, many other people, real people, who were deprived of their freedom in the occupied Crimea, will be free again. People whose homes were taken away. Whose lives are being broken. People who are abused on a daily basis. And who have the right to the main thing - the right to live. The right to live freely. To live with dignity. To live on their native land, to live without occupation and without occupiers. Crimea will be de-occupied. As will all other parts of Ukraine that are now, unfortunately, under occupation. And when someone in the world talks about this - about our territory occupied by Russia - every time it is not about empty land. It is about the land of children, the land of parents. Millions of families, different people, different destinies. Lives that have been and that are yet to come. And they will come. All these lives must be free. Ukraine does not trade territories, because Ukraine does not trade people. That&#x27;s it! And everyone who is here, who participates in the Crimea Platform, who supported the Peace Formula, who wants to end the criminal and unprovoked aggression of the Russian Federation - you all say that human life is priceless. This is very important. I am very, very grateful to you. This is the principle that should be the basis of any relations, international relations. Life is priceless. And the international law on which the protection of human life is based is priceless. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is an honor for me to announce the start of the third Crimea Platform Summit. This year, sixty-three states and international organizations are represented at the summit. Countries from Europe and Asia, both Americas, Africa. Every year there are more and more participants. There is more and more global consensus that the occupation is a crime against international law. Against people. I thank everyone who has come to Ukraine to participate in the Crimea Platform, everyone who will participate online through special addresses. I would especially like to emphasize the parliamentary component of the Crimea Platform, which allows representatives of different parties from different countries to join, and thank you, Ruslan Oleksiyovych, for your help in involving our parliamentarians who equally value the principle of territorial integrity of all states, the UN Charter and international peace. This is important not only for Ukraine. It is important for many countries. Those whose borders may be under the threat of enemy invasion. And which must be constantly, every day, firmly protected from predatory policies aimed against peace. I thank all the parliamentarians who will now take part in the Crimea Platform Parliamentary Summit to be held in the autumn. What is the main task of the Crimea Platform? To prepare the de-occupation. We understand how we will return to Crimea. We understand how many steps we all need to take. We understand how difficult and important this task is. But we see this path. In the year since our previous Crimea Platform meeting, Ukrainian warriors have done extraordinary things. Ukraine has shown that the liberation of our land in the course of military operations is not accidental. Everything is deserved. This is the heroism of our people. And defense support from our partners. I thank all our partners. The courage of Ukrainians and the solidarity of the world that are working for such a desirable common result. Ukrainian forces are moving forward. No matter what anyone says, they are moving forward, and that is the most important thing. We are moving forward. And when Russia retreats from the occupied territories, it simply turns a blind eye to it. To its weakness. Russian society can also turn a blind eye to the occupiers&#x27; withdrawal from Crimea. Over the past year, we have proven that global stability is possible only with Ukraine&#x27;s participation and only when Russia&#x27;s aggressive intentions are defeated. The proof of this is on the dinner tables of every family in the world. When we managed to clear a part of the Black Sea from the Russian occupiers and launched our grain exports by sea, food prices on the world market dropped again. The Black Sea is the key to global food and therefore social stability. Crimea is the key to security in the Black Sea. We cannot leave the keys in the hands of terrorists, and we will not. Ukraine has a clear vision of how normal, peaceful, fair, democratic life will be restored in Crimea after we dismantle Russian tyranny on our Ukrainian peninsula. Wherever Russia comes, the rule of violence is established. We will ensure the rule of law. We will return the true meaning to the infrastructure of Crimea. Throughout Crimea&#x27;s history, its ports and roads have been connected to Ukraine and the rest of the world. Russia has isolated Crimea. We will return the whole world to Crimea. The post-war transformation of Ukraine will ensure economic changes for Crimea that will allow it to work and be economically attractive all year round, not just during the season. We already have the support of international, national, and local Ukrainian businesses that are ready to enter Crimea and start working immediately after the de-occupation. These are powerful brands of international hotel chains, airlines, banking businesses, technology and telecommunications companies, industrial companies, and energy companies. As a part of the Ukrainian economy, Crimea will be a part of the global economy, and today we are taking the first such economic step. We are signing the first document with companies that are ready to come to Crimea following Ukraine. This is an open document, it is open for any other bona fide businesses to join. Thousands of Ukrainian, European and global companies will come to Crimea. Such companies as Ryanair and Royal HaskoningDHV have already announced their readiness to invest. The international association of hotels and tourism organizations, whose representatives are here today, supports the restoration of Crimea, and I am grateful to them. SkyUp/JoinUp, Vodafone, Luxoft, Softserve, Genesis, Sigma Software are present at the summit, SQUAD, Ribas Group, Edem, Okko, Lifecell, Nokia, Hyatt Ukraine, Epam, Polski Holding Hotelowy, Fozzy group, and many others. I am very, very grateful to all of you. The ones who will build a real, normal, modern, free economic life in Crimea together with others. Russia&#x27;s activities in Crimea have led to the catastrophic destruction of ecosystems on the peninsula and in the surrounding waters. Instead of terrorist bases, Crimea needs national parks and nature reserves. Instead of ammunition depots for aggression, it needs international cruise ships. Instead of the fenced estates of war criminals and corrupt officials, Crimea needs new modern public spaces, new modern technology companies, and a new modern university. It is only Ukraine that can bring modernity back to Crimea, and thanks to modernity, thanks to openness, thanks to security, we can guarantee a high quality of life in Crimea. And it will be a decent life that everyone who supports Ukraine wants for Crimea. Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! In a recent letter from Leniye Umerova, it is said that the words &quot;dignity&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; have no price. And it is true. They are priceless. There is a price for delay. There is a price for fear. There is a price for trying to appease the aggressor by ignoring annexations. A catastrophic price. It is time to close this account. All of Ukraine will be free! I thank everyone who is present here, I thank everyone who helps us with this every day in a very powerful way! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Congratulations by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Independence Day of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-24</span></div>
  <p>The great people of the great Ukraine, celebrating today a great day - Independence Day! A holiday of free people. A holiday of strong people. A holiday of people with dignity. A holiday of equals. Ukrainian men and women. All of them. In our entire country. Today we celebrate the 32nd anniversary of our independence - the independence of Ukraine. This is a value for each of us. And this is what we are fighting for. And everyone is important in this fight. Because this is a fight for something that is important to everyone. An independent Ukraine. In a big war, there are no small deeds. No unnecessary ones. No unimportant ones. This is true of people, deeds, and words. When we celebrate Ukraine&#x27;s independence, everyone can feel a part of it. Everyone can ask themselves: where are you in Ukrainian independence? What did you add to independence? And what did you do to help independence? And today I want to dedicate these congratulations to you. To you, who is giving Ukraine its independence. To you, warrior! You stood up to defend Ukraine. I thank every soldier and sailor, every sergeant and petty officer, every officer, every general. To you, the father of a Ukrainian warrior, and to you, the mother of a Ukrainian defender. To all Ukrainian families who have raised their children to love Ukraine and have the courage to defend it with all their might. I am grateful to everyone who is waiting for their loved ones from the frontline, to everyone who prays for them every day, who calls or texts such an important &quot;How are you?&quot; to hear the much desired &quot;Everything is fine!&quot;. Such a precious &quot;I love you&quot;... &quot;Our son took his first step yesterday&quot;... &quot;Daughter today said: &quot;Dad&quot;... Every word is important. And everyone who makes sure that this word can be said and heard is important. Who provides communication in the country. Connection between people. And this is more than just communication. It is a connection with life. Words of support. Words of gratitude. And, unfortunately, the words that are the most painful in war: &quot;He is gone...&quot; Many Ukrainians lost loved ones because of the war. Heroes who prevented us from losing Ukraine. I thank and bow to each and every one of them. Last week I visited our combat brigades. Command posts, brigade positions. And there is something that unites them all. One additional unique armor helps our warriors. The armor of humanity. The armor of sincerity. These are children&#x27;s drawings. You can see them in every brigade. On the walls, in the rooms. Drawings for a father or brother. Or for soldiers whom the children may not know, but whom they support. Because they are Ukrainian soldiers. And for them, this is the main goal of the offensive, where every step forward is so important, but every step back is so impossible. Because it is you, our children, who are behind them. Ukrainian children, exactly you, those who are creating these drawings. And I want to say to you - to every boy and girl: you have no idea how important it is when you support our warriors. I thank you! I am grateful to every Ukrainian mother for whom our country is and will remain home. Despite the fact that they had to leave because of the war. And when a mother in any country gives her child a book in Ukrainian so that the child does not lose himself or herself, when a mother teaches Ukrainian, when she worries about Ukraine and waits for news from Ukraine, waits to be able to return, this is the most important thing. Because you are important. All Ukrainians! No matter where you happen to be now. I want to thank all Ukrainian teachers who are working, who managed to work even online. Who are building an educated future even where the enemy has destroyed schools. And everyone who performs miracles in real life. Thousands of Ukrainian medics who save thousands of lives. Ukrainian doctors. Nurses. Combat medics. Those who do not let go of life 24/7 and fight for it. Regardless of whether there is an air raid alert. Regardless of whether there is a &quot;hit&quot;. Regardless of whether you are at the front or in civilian life... Thank you! Dear Ukrainian people! Last winter, we experienced massive missile attacks and the threat of blackout. There were different moments. When cities remained in darkness. When it was cold. There was also indomitability. And when our people worked and turned the power back on, there were loud &quot;Glory to Ukraine!&quot;, &quot;Glory to Ukrainian electricians!&quot;, and glasses were raised to air defense and our power engineers. And this is absolutely true. Our power engineers worked around the clock. During air raids. Sometimes under fire. Always in danger. Always knowing how much people are waiting for electricity in hospitals and defense enterprises. And how much every family is waiting for light and warmth. But, unfortunately, there are families who have lost their father, son, brother... An ordinary electrician, repairman, rescuer, police officer, firefighter... All those who died in the line of duty. Those who helped to do the most important thing - to prevent the Russian darkness from breaking us, our state, our freedom, our independence. In light and in darkness, our news was with us. Our Ukrainian journalists. The truth was with us. And the world heard Ukraine. I thank everyone who spreads the truth about Ukraine and this war in different languages. But today I want to speak separately about those who cannot yet be mentioned in the news, whose names are known to few, but whose work is visible to all. Our missiles. Ukrainian munitions. Our artillery. Ukrainian drones: Leleka, Fury. Naval drones, Neptune, Corsar, Stugna. We produce all of this. Ukrainians produce all of this. And when we are proud to have sunk the flagship of the enemy fleet, Moskva cruiser, when we rejoice at hitting the Kerch Bridge, we also thank those who cannot be mentioned now, whose names cannot be told, but about whom books will be written and movies will definitely be made in the future. Those whom I award with classified decrees and who carry out the most difficult operations. Thank you! You are all important! So is everyone who has no right to make a mistake. Who demines our territories - our cities and villages, our fields. Who sows fields despite the shelling. Who harvests the crops despite the shelling. Who delivers it across the country so that we have bread. Who, despite the danger, transports Ukrainian grain by rail, road, and sea to many other countries so that there is no hunger in the world. Everyone who works and employs others is important. Everyone who pays taxes, which provide for the army, defense, advancement and future victory. Everyone who organizes fundraising campaigns and keeps the fire of volunteering, this sincere Ukrainian unity alive. Everyone who finds and brings everything that is needed in the trenches. Everyone who trains our warriors. Who glorifies Ukraine with sporting victories. Who opened the doors of their homes and sheltered those who lost their homes. Thank you! Those who give birth to motivating lyrics for Ukrainians, arrange them to beautiful music, and perform these songs for the warriors at the front, for the wounded in hospitals, and at charity concerts around the world. In the world that is fighting side by side with us. With Ukraine. Everyone who survived the occupation is important. Who was holding the Ukrainian flag in the squares. Those who are still under occupation, but keep our flag so that the occupier cannot find it. Those who have waited and will witness the return of Ukraine. Who was wounded, who lost limbs, but did not lose themselves. And most importantly, we all did not lose you. Those who survived captivity. Those who were deprived of their freedom, but not their will. Who did not lose Ukraine in themselves. Those who came back and continue to fight. And those who will return. They will. All those who have proved that everyone is needed, everyone is important - people, deeds, and words. Because we all made it so that when one person says: &quot;Glory to Ukraine!&quot;, the whole world responds: &quot;Glory to the Heroes!&quot; Happy Independence Day, Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will not lose grip on our independence and will give Ukraine the strength to always prevail - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Independence Day in St. Sophia Square</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-24</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainian people! Dear guests of Ukraine, our friends. Dear Presidents! Dear Prime Minister! Representatives of the diplomatic corps! Today we are all celebrating the 32nd anniversary of Ukraine&#x27;s independence. 32 years of uninterrupted independence, which will endure. Which we will not allow to be torn apart. And which Ukrainians will not lose grip on. Here, in the very center of our capital, there is a lot of evidence of how old the history of Ukrainian statehood is. Unfortunately, there is no less memory of how Ukrainian statehood was lost. How Ukrainians had to fight for freedom and independence against invaders. How our people always had enough heroism and courage, but sometimes lacked unity. How Ukrainians had to fight against the invaders. How, unfortunately, sometimes the invaders managed to become occupiers. How they destroyed the lives of entire generations of our people. And how Ukrainians fought for their land and freedom for generations. And how they gained their freedom. How they prevailed. How they preserved themselves. Preserved Ukraine. And managed to make Ukrainian independence uninterrupted. Dear attendees! Please observe a moment of silence in memory of Ukrainian heroes of different times who fought for the freedom and independence of Ukraine and gave their lives for it. Thank you. Dear people! We will not lose grip on Ukrainian independence. We are all united by this feeling. We remember what the Ukrainian people went through. We see the threats. We are fighting the enemy. And we know what we are capable of. We are capable of winning! And we will prevail! Ukrainian children in Ukrainian squares and streets will celebrate Ukrainian independence in the same way. Our grandchildren will celebrate. And their grandchildren. Together with the friends of our state. With Ukraine&#x27;s allies and partners. The ones Ukraine will choose for itself. Always freely. And there will never be any more pauses in Ukrainian history. We will give Ukraine the strength it needs to always prevail. And we will be tough on anyone who tries to undermine, trade, or weaken Ukraine&#x27;s power from within. And there will be appropriate legislative initiatives. In the near future. We will cherish our unity. When Russia invaded with a full-scale war, there was not a single day that Ukraine lacked unity. And so Russia had no opportunity to use anything against us, against Ukraine. Everything is only for Ukraine now. The world hears and supports Ukraine. The world&#x27;s majority stands with Ukraine and helps. But no matter what happens in the world, Ukraine must be able to defend itself. Always. For a long time, our country did not have the necessary defense production, and now it does. I thank everyone who is developing them today. And we will create more. For a long time, the bravery of our warriors did not have the experience of using the world&#x27;s best weapons, and now our state gives Ukrainian warriors such weaponry. And I thank everyone who helps us with it. For a long time, there were attempts to artificially divide Ukraine into camps to make it impossible for our country to join the right alliance. Ukrainian courage deserves to be in the world&#x27;s best alliances only. Ukraine deserves to be among the leaders of the world. And it will be! Our country already guarantees common European security. This security is impossible without your strength, Ukrainian warriors. Without the potential of Ukraine. Without the freedom and labor of our entire country, all our people. Without Ukraine, our common European home can only be an unfinished construction project. And I thank every leader who understands this. This morning in my address on Independence Day, I thanked everyone who makes Ukrainian independence so strong that it is one of the foundations of European independence. I thanked our warriors. Every citizen of Ukraine - everyone for whom citizenship is not just a passport. Those who work for the sake of Ukraine and our people. I thanked our Ukrainian teachers, medical workers, combat medics, volunteers, rescuers, sappers, firefighters, police, and power engineers. All those who support the morale of Ukrainians. Our talents. Everyone who produces weapons for Ukraine. Who provides transportation for Ukraine. Who prays for Ukrainians. Our farmers. Ukrainian businesses that pay taxes and create jobs. Ukrainian strength always lies in people. In adults and children. In everyone. In everyone who cares about Ukraine. About each other. And about independence. And it is impossible to gather all our people in one square to thank them. But today, here, in this square, there are Ukrainians who deserve personal gratitude. And it is an honor for me to present you with the state awards of Ukraine on the occasion of Independence Day. Dear attendees! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine&#x27;s partners are here with us today. Gitanas, Mr. President of Lithuania. A powerful friend of Ukraine. A defender of freedom. Jonas, Mr. Prime Minister of Norway. A leader who deserves to be a role model for other heads of state. Mr. President of Portugal. I thank you, Mr. President, for the truly heartfelt warmth with which the Portuguese people sheltered our people at the beginning of the war. Mr. Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the first time in Ukraine, but sincerely with Ukraine. East, north, west and south of Europe. Our common home. Our Europe is indeed united by many things. But the key thing is respect. Respect for people. Respect for freedom. Respect for bravery. And respect for Ukraine. Congratulations, Ukraine, on your Independence Day! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The task is to speed up the moment when F-16s will help us keep Russian terrorists away – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-25</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on this day. All the agreements we brought home from our partners are being implemented already. First of all, F-16 jets. The tasks are obvious. For the international team, it is to maximize the expansion of training missions. For the military, it is to accelerate the preparation of the infrastructure as much as possible, to send pilots and engineers to ensure Ukraine&#x27;s full readiness. And all together, it is about bringing closer the moment when F-16s will help us keep Russian terrorists away. Today I held a meeting on the results of the visits. It was a long meeting. The issue of coordination was specifically about the jets. Preparation of new defense packages - with exactly the content that our warriors need and that they told me about when I visited the front. We are also preparing our new international events for the autumn, new steps in relations with partners that should strengthen Ukraine. The autumn will be eventful in terms of our diplomacy. By the way, late yesterday evening I had a conversation with U.S. President Biden. It was a good conversation. I thanked him for his Independence Day greetings. We discussed how to further strengthen freedom. And we have a new important agreement: America will join the training of F-16 pilots and engineers. There will be more news in this and other areas. Thank you! Today I met with the Turkish Foreign Minister in Kyiv. It was an important meeting. We discussed the security component, our joint diplomatic work, and the fundamental humanitarian things we are doing together. In particular, this is the release of our people from Russian captivity. We talked about the Peace Formula and the preparation of the Global Peace Summit. We also talked about the situation that has arisen due to Russia&#x27;s dastardly attacks on grain exports in the Black Sea region. Obviously, these are attacks on global security. They are calculated. They are aimed at provoking crises in different regions of the world. And together with Türkiye, we can restore security step by step, as we have repeatedly proved. I believe we will do even more together. We are already preparing for next week. There will be some special internal political meetings. They are already scheduled. Regarding legislative decisions... Something that will definitely protect our state from all those who are trying to weaken it, who, unfortunately, do not think about Ukraine, even though they hold positions in the state system. The strength of Ukraine has no alternatives. And, of course, our warriors. The paratroopers of the &quot;Eightieth&quot;, who are fighting hard in the Bakhmut sector. The 68th separate hunting brigade, which is destroying the occupiers in the Lyman sector. The 12th operational brigade of the National Guard, which is delivering the results Ukraine needs in the Kreminna sector - thank you! The 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Air Assault Forces - thank you for your strength in the Orikhiv sector. The 59th separate motorized infantry brigade in the Donetsk sector – they are very, very effective. Thank you! And our rocket crewmen: the 27th Otaman Kalnyshevsky rocket artillery brigade and the 107th Kremenchuk rocket artillery brigade - thank you, warriors, for your exceptional accuracy in the Zaporizhzhia sector! Glory to all who are fighting and working for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Only those states have true strength that can defend their sky and honor their aviation – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-26</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! For 30 years now, on the last Saturday of August, Ukrainian aviation workers, both military and civilian, have been celebrating their professional holiday. Pilots, engineers, everyone who works in the aviation industry, in aircraft production, in air transportation. Everyone who makes Ukraine one of the powerful countries. Because only those states have true strength that can defend their sky and honor their aviation. Now, this year, Ukraine has to accomplish all the necessary tasks for F-16s to appear in our sky. This will be a new level of Ukrainian military aviation. And this will bring the return of civil aviation to the Ukrainian sky closer, because it will bring victory closer and give Ukraine more security. There are a lot of reasons for congratulations on this Aviation Day. There is much to be thankful for. And I am thankful. We are all thankful. Unfortunately, these words alone are not enough today. Yesterday, a disaster occurred in the sky over Zhytomyr region. Three pilots died. Among them was Andriy Pilshchykov, call sign Juice. He was a Ukrainian officer, one of those who helped our country a lot. A lot! My condolences to the family and friends, to everyone who knew the guys. The investigation into what happened is ongoing. It&#x27;s too early to talk about the details. Of course, all the circumstances will be clarified. Of course, Ukraine will never forget anyone who defended Ukraine&#x27;s free sky. May they always be remembered! I would like to say a few more words today. First of all, our warriors. In the Bakhmut sector, all those who are fighting in the areas of Klishchiivka, Andriivka, and Kurdiumivka. The Avdiivka sector. Maryinka. The Melitopol sector, in particular, Robotyne. Thank you for your fortitude, warriors! Second, our partners. As of today, more than 20 countries have already joined the G7 declaration on security guarantees for Ukraine. Our team continues its work. Now there are almost 30 in total, including the G7. There will be more. We have started negotiations with Canada on a bilateral document on security guarantees. Earlier we started with the United States and the United Kingdom. This will give Ukraine much more opportunities. I am grateful to each and every person who works for this! And the third is our emotions. We should not let our emotions take over anywhere or in anything. Especially between us, within society, between Ukrainians. Please take care of each other. And have time to thank everyone who helps the defense, everyone who helps Ukraine. We are defending our country, moving forward in an absolutely rational manner and bringing our victory - the victory of Ukraine - closer. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

To those Ukrainians who have distinguished themselves the most in protecting lives and Ukraine over the past seven days. Our warriors, our rescuers. Soldier Yaroslav Bevz - a warrior of the 47th separate mechanized brigade. He was one of the first in the assault group to enter and gain a foothold in Robotyne, Zaporizhzhia.

And today - without names, without details, but there is something to recognize our intelligence officers and special services for. The personnel of the Main Intelligence Directorate and the Security Service of Ukraine. All of them. Well done indeed! I am proud of our warriors! I am proud of our people! As usual, there will be meetings of the Staff this week. The agenda is already set. In particular, there will be decisions that will allow us to further strengthen our warriors. Allow military commanders to prepare the infrastructure for new Ukrainian aircraft more actively. Allow diplomats to promote everything that our warriors need more actively in communication with partners. The requests from each of the units are very clear. This is exactly what the results of Ukrainian diplomacy should be. Glory to all who defend Ukraine and Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our defense industry will yield better results - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-28</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a long and meaningful day of discussions and meetings. International events, our communication, the Ukrainian agenda. A brief report. The key thing, of course, is the Staff. It concerned what we&#x27;re doing now and what we need to be prepared for. First of all, the frontline. First of all, the Kupyansk direction, the key spots in Donetsk region - Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Maryinka, and the southern directions, in particular, Orikhiv. Reports by Generals Zaluzhny, Syrskyi, and Tarnavskyi. A report by the Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate on the plans of the occupiers. We will respond to their intentions. We will. And in a way they do not expect. There were several reports from government officials and the military on reinforcing our border regions, and the issue of finances for this has been resolved. There was a separate meeting on our Ukrainian arms production. The Ministry of Strategic Industries, Ukroboronprom, and heads of domestic production facilities. Artillery made in Ukraine. Shells made in Ukraine. Drones, missiles, armored vehicles. We are maximizing production capacity. Ukraine can do it. Funding is available. Our defense industry will yield better results. We have two tasks for the next meeting of the Staff. The first is a report on preparations for the winter. Various aspects, including security. Second: a program of preparation for the use of new combat aircraft. Politically, everything has already been done. Agreements have been reached. The key thing now is to prepare the infrastructure efficiently and quickly. This is already a military task. And one more thing. There was a report by law enforcers on the inspection of the military medical commissions across the country. We are bringing this issue for consideration by the National Security and Defense Council. We will present the report and decision to the public. I thank everyone who works for Ukraine! Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is a duty to be worthy of the path Ukraine is on - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today is a special day. The Day of Remembrance. The day of all our defenders who have perished in battles for Ukraine since 2014, since February 24. Sons, daughters. Fathers, mothers. Brothers, sisters. Friends. Colleagues. Acquaintances. Brothers-in-arms. Many Ukrainians today have someone to remember, someone to honor. Today, many of us were thinking of our loved ones, relatives and friends who are now at war. Who are now risking their lives every day, every hour for the sake of Ukraine. Every such day is a reminder for our entire nation. For everyone who works for the state. It is a reminder of what makes up our country. Ukrainian families whose sons and daughters perished in battles. For them, for the parents of Ukrainian heroes, the blue and yellow flag of Ukraine is now a reminder of their child, of his or her feat for the sake of the country. A child whose father died at the front defending Ukraine... Loved ones who will never meet again because the war took away a life that became the life of Ukraine... Everything that is our state and everyone who is our state - every institution, every official - must feel what kind of Ukraine is behind them. How much pain is in its heart. How much courage it has. What the memory of people who are no longer alive is. What is now in its symbols. And how differently people now perceive everything that humiliates Ukraine, its strength and hopes. It is a duty to be worthy of the path Ukraine is on. To give Ukraine more strength. More opportunities. It is a duty. To care about everyone around you. To support them. To take care of people. And always bring the result closer. The main result for Ukraine. Ukraine must prevail. This is the main thing for everyone. So that we do not have to look away from the photos of the warriors on the Wall of Remembrance and other memorials. I thank everyone who works for Ukraine, who fights for Ukraine in this way: with dignity, courage, and strength. Glory to all our warriors! Glory to our people, the people of Ukraine! May the memory of all those who gave their lives for the sake of Ukraine be eternal. Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes!</p>

  <h2>No queues: MMCs&#x27; work digitalization is of great importance - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-30</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report for the day. First of all, the NSDC. I held a meeting today. As I said earlier, there was only one issue - MMCs. The inspection of military medical commissions across the country is underway. Law enforcers will complete it soon. And there are already several conclusions. It is necessary to check a significant number of decisions of the military medical commissions on disability and unfitness for military service that were made after February 24. Today, the relevant statistics were presented at the National Security and Defense Council. There are examples of regions where the number of people removed from the military register due to the MMC&#x27;s decision has increased tenfold since February last year. It is absolutely clear what these decisions are. Corrupt decisions. And in the criminal proceedings that are currently underway against the staff of MMCs and MSECs, it is even clearer how many decisions could have been falsified. Law enforcement officers have already clearly identified unreasonable MMCs&#x27; decisions. Specific evidence has been recorded. It has been presented behind closed doors. Different regions of the country, different TRCs, different officials. The bribes range from 3 to 15 thousand dollars. They will be held accountable. The list of those who went abroad due to obviously dubious decisions of MMCs will be analyzed separately. First of all, due to the decisions of those who have already been caught taking bribes. We are talking about at least thousands of people. We will also address the issue that almost all commanders in the field are referring to - the concept of so-called limited fitness. For a very long time, this concept allowed for manipulation in the manning of units. In particular, combat brigades. Everything related to fitness or unfitness for military service must be as clear as possible. So that a person understands how he or she can help the defense, and so that the units have clarity on who will be joining them. And a very important point is the digitalization of the MMCs&#x27; work. No more queues. No more wandering around to find or sign the right paper. All this can be ensured electronically and by the presence of the necessary military personnel at the place where the medical examination takes place, if it is in a civilian medical institution. Government officials will complete this digitalization work. And we need full accessibility in all areas of the civilian medical system for the purpose of undergoing the MMC&#x27;s examination. Some regions, such as Volyn, have ensured this one hundred percent. And another example is that in Kyiv, almost nothing has been done to allow people to undergo the MMC&#x27;s examination in civilian medical institutions. Therefore, the military command, the medical sector, and all levels of government must work as actively as possible to resolve this issue. The second topic for today is our international agenda. We are actively preparing for the negotiations and meetings scheduled for September. I have held meetings with international relations officials, with our ambassadors in the respective countries. We clearly see which leaders we need to meet and negotiate with, and what results we have to bring to Ukraine. The third issue is the European Union. I held a large meeting with representatives of the parliament, government officials, and our international relations officials on our readiness for the launch of membership negotiations with the EU. The implementation of the recommendations. The necessary bills that have already been prepared and need to be passed in the parliament. 226 votes for each decision for Ukraine in the European Union is an obligation. And a few more things. Peace Formula. Today, a new meeting was held with representatives of diplomatic missions on the implementation of the Peace Formula. Andriy Yermak chaired it. And today, there were 11 more diplomats, bringing the total to more than 70 diplomatic missions involved. This is a very good dynamic. And there can be even more participating states. The world majority will be with us. The Peace Formula is designed so that every country and every leader can demonstrate their capabilities for the sake of a common result, for a just and lasting peace. And our air defense. I thank every warrior who defends Ukrainian skies every day and every night. We are working very hard to provide Ukraine with new air defense systems. Now is not the time to talk publicly about the details, but negotiations on additional air defense systems are ongoing with our various partners. Step by step, we are bringing this success closer for Ukraine. Glory to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! I thank everyone in the world who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every result of Ukraine is the education of a particular Ukrainian - Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s speech on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-31</span></div>
  <p>Glory to Ukraine! Well, these are Ukrainians. I am really glad to be here today. First, a few words - they are probably more formal, but with the relevant content that I would like to convey. And then we will talk in this format - your format. I am glad to see you and congratulate you on a very important day in my opinion - the 125th anniversary of Kyiv Polytechnic. 125 years is a young age for a university. But even though your university is young, the National Technical University is well known in the world and is famous in different countries whose people have studied here, and most importantly, the university has gained what is so important for all Ukrainians now - trust. The university has gained trust. And it is a well-deserved trust. Because the university is really strong. I thank you for maintaining the strength and glory of Kyiv Polytechnic! The university went through different times. As well as Ukraine in general did. Now - in the time of such a war - it is especially difficult. But no matter how difficult it is and no matter what the times are, the fact that education matters remains unchanged. Knowledge, education, real competence of a person - in good times it is almost impossible to win in competition with others without it, and in difficult times there are no victories without it. I&#x27;ll give you a couple of examples. Every day there is news about another &quot;cotton&quot; somewhere on the aggressor&#x27;s territory. There are different cases. Sometimes they are very loud, sometimes less loud. But they all give a little more sense of justice. Because the war with its consequences comes back to the aggressor. Our people appreciate the sense of justice. They appreciate that the aggressor does not go unpunished. And when cotton branches stand here in Kyiv, in Crimean Tatar cafes, it symbolizes just such a satisfying sense of justice. But what is the basis for this? For justice to be served, someone&#x27;s knowledge, knowledge itself, must work. And the knowledge must work for the result. The Moskva cruiser went down because the competencies of thousands of Ukrainians, from designers and manufacturers of the relevant weapons and missiles to the specific soldiers who carried out this operation, worked. Each combat use of our naval drones is a fact that the education of many people who created the drones, the people who control them, who ensure the existence of this modern new force of ours, worked. We now have artillery production, which we did not have before in the country. The production of the necessary shells. Each such result of Ukraine is the education of a particular Ukrainian. And, by the way, many of them were educated here, at Kyiv Polytechnic, and in other Ukrainian technical universities. Here is another example. It may seem completely different, but it is also about education. Putin used to love foreign visits. Now he is afraid to go anywhere further than Gelendzhik. And he&#x27;s really afraid to go even to places where they are still willing to host him. Unfortunately, there are still such countries, but nonetheless. Why is he afraid, what is the reason? Among other things, the reason is an arrest warrant for him from the International Criminal Court. Which can be implemented at different times, quite rightly, in different countries... What is the basis of this warrant? This is the integrity of the International Criminal Court team. This is also the work of many people in Ukraine, in the ICC, and in partner countries - all those who record Russian war crimes, who have been engaged in legal and communication elements so that the world recognizes the Russian deportation of Ukrainian children as a crime. Without proper professional education, there would be neither such institutions working to protect against Russian evil, nor such principled approach as this warrant, nor such clear work to record what Russia has done. And this is a fact. A third example. We are now defending ourselves in a fundamentally new war. It is the Ukrainian defense and the Ukrainian victory in the war that will be a lesson for other nations on how to defend themselves and how to save lives. This also applies to the drone war - everyone in the world is already drawing conclusions. Tactics on the battlefield. Cyber defense. Hybrid warfare - information warfare. The world sees what equipment works. What solutions help. What really strengthens the defense. And the way the world hears Ukraine, perceives the truth about this war, supports us... These are many thousands of technical, managerial, technological, and other solutions that have worked for Ukraine. If Ukrainians were not an educated nation, if the social competence of our people was not so high, if we, you, were not committed to innovation and open to the most open dialogue with the world for the sake of our country, for the sake of defense, Ukraine&#x27;s fate could be similar to what other nations are experiencing whose independence has been lost. It is very difficult to regain independence, there are many historical examples. It is almost impossible. And Ukraine withstood. And Ukraine continues to live. Ukraine is defending itself. Ukraine is regaining what belongs to it. Thanks to this modern knowledge. Thanks to courage. Thanks to unity. Thanks to weapons. This is a fact. Thanks to the support of the world. But also because each of these elements works on the basis of education. And let Ukraine become stronger together with our Ukrainian education. With your Polytechnic, with all the universities, I wish you all this, with the ideas and competencies. Education matters a lot. And when it matters to us, Ukraine will matter a lot. To everyone in the world. I wish the new academic year to be very fruitful and victorious for all of us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>An agreement has been reached on the supply of a large batch of armored medevac vehicles to Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-08-31</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was an eventful day. A conference call with military and government officials. The frontline. Our offensive actions. The result of our weapons, new Ukrainian weapons, is 700 kilometers. The task is farther. The important news for the frontline is that we have agreed on the supply of armored medevac vehicles to Ukraine, a large batch. This is what the warriors told me about when we visited combat brigades. The Ministry of Defense has reported on this today. As always on the conference calls, there were intelligence reports from the Main Intelligence Directorate and the Foreign Intelligence Service on the plans of the occupiers. Their plans are hopeless. I held a meeting about next week&#x27;s international events. There will be significant things. Important negotiations for Ukraine. Another meeting concerned tomorrow. It will be September 1, the beginning of the new school year. Deputy Prime Minister Fedorov and Minister Lisovyi, together with their teams, are preparing a very positive innovation for our schoolchildren, parents, and teachers. Something that will really help. Tomorrow we will present the first details. Today I congratulated Kyiv Polytechnic on the 125th anniversary of the university. It was extremely pleasant and useful to communicate with students and lecturers. Education will always remain the element that gives strength to people and the state, that enables us to develop and become stronger no matter what. And I would like to thank today our students and lecturers, our educators who not only receive or help receive education, but also make the educational process as practical as it is needed right now, when the bright minds of our people help the Ukrainian defense, in particular. Our students have good projects, powerful projects. The Ministry of Strategic Industry has something to implement. And one more thing. I had a meeting with representatives of BAE Systems. The world knows this company very well. And our warriors are already very familiar with the weapons produced by this company. In particular, artillery - L119 and M777, armored vehicles - CV90, which are very powerful. The company is starting to work in Ukraine. Our goal is to have all the most useful weapons for defense produced in Ukraine. And it will happen. We already produce certain items, and we will produce all the necessary ones. I thank everyone in the world who helps! I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! I would especially like to mention the 47th separate mechanized brigade - thank you guys for your advancement; the warriors of our 44th artillery brigade - thank you for your accuracy! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No doubt that Italy&#x27;s G7 presidency will provide strong solutions for global security – address of President of Ukraine to participants of Ambrosetti Forum held in Cernobbio</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-01</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much. Thank you for your kind words. Thank you for your words, for your support! Ciao Italia! I am very glad to see you all and participate in your Ambrosetti Forum for the second time. I want to start... I have a few thoughts, and then we will talk. I know you want to ask some questions. First of all, could I start with my question? Could you have imagined just a few years ago that the news about a ship that passed through the Black Sea to the Bosphorus could be important news? It would seem that there can be no news in this. And it should be routine. But this has to be done routine. Ukraine is returning real freedom of navigation to the Black Sea region. We, as a state, do it, and so do companies and businesses representing different states. Different ship owners. Already the second vessel, blocked in our ports by Russian aggression, passed through a new lane in the western part of the Black Sea. And now a bulk carrier with steel for consumers in Africa is already in the Mediterranean region. Why am I starting with this example? Because this seemingly small example illustrates a very, very important truth, namely, how important the power of a decision is. Both political and business. Real power. When you see what needs to be done. When you dare to act. And when you act in such a way that your leadership enables others to be more of a leader. And when I say that, I&#x27;m talking about Italy in particular. Because not a single day when we cooperated with you, with your state, with your government, with Giorgia, with Italian companies, I had no doubt that the Italian decisions would be strong. Italy supported us in defense, in particular with a very important air defense system. Powerful SAMP-T. Italy supported us politically, in particular in the EU, supported our candidate status. Italy supported us with security guarantees, in particular, it signed a declaration on Ukraine together with the entire G7. Next year is the time of Italy&#x27;s presidency in G7. And I have no doubt that this time will bring strong solutions not only for our common security, not only for our whole Europe, but also globally. And we all see why and whom we oppose. Whom our and your strength has to deal with. On that side, beyond our front line, there is no strength, there is only meanness and stockpiles of weapons. Is there any strength in the fact that Russia fires missiles at peaceful cities? Or drops guided aerial bombs on schools? Russia is not demonstrating its strength by this. Vice versa. These are the crimes of someone who fears that he has already lost everything. Who realizes this. But he does not admit it yet. Is there any strength in hitting a plane with your rival by a missile? And at the same time, be afraid to fly out of the Russia&#x27;s territory to any country. And travel around your country exclusively on an armored train. Although this is a regularity. Because if one terrorist kills another terrorist in such a state, there will be a third one. When we look at Russia after all this, we see nothing but weakness. And even now, when they are trying to add chaos to Africa, they are not showing their strength. Russian mercenaries in Africa are an attempt to distract the world from what today&#x27;s Russia has become. Terror does not hide weakness – it only hurts. Strength does something completely different. Strength always removes chaos. It does not multiply it. Strength always defends its land, and does not grab someone else&#x27;s. Strength is that you respect yourself, and you are really respected by others, you are respected by your people, you are respected by other nations. And they communicate with you because of this, because of this respect, and not because you have nuclear weapons. Strength – when it is real – does not bring war, but peace. Peace will be our result with you. Because we have strength. Thank you, Italy! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Smile of every child, every lesson conducted by Ukrainian teachers today is proof that Ukraine will definitely endure – address of President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-01</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! I just held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff. In fact, the entire meeting is about the situation at the front now. The Commander-in-Chief, commanders. A separate closed report by Defense Intelligence Chief Budanov. The situation in the East, in the South, on the left bank of Kherson region. Supply of ammunition. Missiles for our air defense. Equipment. Ukrainian production of weapons. Many different nuances, many different details. The key is to give our soldiers even more necessary for offensive operations, for demining, for the evacuation of wounded soldiers. Each meeting participant clearly understands what he should do. There was a meeting with law enforcement officers – they continue cleansing the state of those, who are still trying to weaken Ukraine from the inside. Autumn should be fruitful in this matter – especially for Ukraine. I took part in a very representative Italian forum - the Ambrosetti Forum. It is one of the key European platforms for policy development. Those solutions that are needed. Economic, security, political. I thanked Italy for all the support provided. But I urged never to give up our natural strength – the strength of the entire free world. Strength to act together. To the full. For our common interests. Just as we have been operating for 555 days of the full-scale war. And most importantly for today. The most emotional. I&#x27;m sure not just for me. More than 3,700,000 Ukrainian children started the new school year today. Most of them are in Ukraine. Most of them are offline or in a mixed mode, where social interaction between children is still preserved. Of course, we will do everything to make it possible for them to return to schools and universities across all our land – as usual. Without online. The shelter creation program will be implemented. And we will return freedom to our entire land. The smile of every child today, every flower that children brought to school, every lesson that Ukrainian teachers conducted today, and every dream that arose today in Ukrainian children are all proofs that Ukraine will definitely endure. Life goes on. Life is getting stronger. And there will be a day when September 1 will be equally peaceful and safe throughout our land. Glory to all who bring this time closer! The time of our victory. And today, I would like to personally thank everyone who has already taken an interest in our new educational project, the public project – the Mriia application, which I presented and which will soon be able to become part of the life of every child who is studying and who strives for his result together with all of us. Together with Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This Saturday, three cities that are indispensable part of Ukraine celebrating their day – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-02</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! This Saturday, three cities are celebrating their day. The cities that are indispensable part of Ukraine. Odesa. Our support in the south, on the Black Sea. A city that, together with Ukraine, has and will always have global significance. A port on which the lives of various nations depend – from Ukrainian exports through the Great Odesa. A city of culture that knows how to be interesting to everyone and respects everyone. We have defended Odesa from destruction. Because the Russian regime is incapable of bringing anything other than degradation. And we will return security to Odesa. Odesa has always been a place where you feel lightness and happiness. Odesa will remain this way. Congratulations on your Day! Sumy. Our outpost in the northeast. Every year, on the second Saturday of September, it celebrates its day. And it will always celebrate it as a free, Ukrainian city. During these times – the times of war – unfortunately, we often receive reports of Russian terror from Sumy. About shelling, missiles, and bombs. About constant attempts by Russian sabotage groups to infiltrate the region. &quot;But despite everything, Sumy region is alive. Sumy is alive and gives strength to the entire region. And when I was in the city, I felt that there is faith there. Faith that evil will not prevail. Faith in people. Faith in Ukraine. Faith that we will definitely get through this time. And we will win. It will be so. Sumy, congratulations! And the third city – Lysychansk. A city that Ukraine still needs to reclaim along with the entire Luhansk region. Today, no one can specify a date when the city will be free again. But everyone who fights and works for Ukraine is doing everything possible so that our cities and villages currently under occupation can once again experience normal and free life. Lysychansk has always been one of the pillars of the east of our state, one of the key cities. A proud city! It will remain so. A city that knows how to work and is rightfully proud of its achievements. Together with Ukraine, it&#x27;s all possible. With our strength, unity, and our ability to take care of each other – all cities together, all villages, all people. And one more thing worth mentioning. Undoubtedly, we will defend Ukraine and restore freedom to all our land. Each of us feels that this will be a Ukraine with different rules. The borders are the same. Democracy is probably just as turbulent. Freedom is one of the greatest in Europe, as always. But without a doubt, there will be no more decades-long &#x27;business as usual&#x27; for those who plundered Ukraine and put themselves above the law and any rules. And I thank the Ukrainian law enforcement for their determination to bring every case stalled for decades to a just conclusion. The law must work. It is so. It will be so. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Rustem Umerov should head the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-03</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! At the end of the week, I would like to say a few things. First, Ukraine has become stronger. We have new agreements with our partners on defense packages. And, by the way, today in a conversation with French President Macron, we discussed what new supplies can help our warriors. We discussed the protection of our Odesa region - what France can do to protect Odesa and the region. And there is a very important agreement on training our pilots in France - our coalition of modern fighters is getting more powerful. There are significant things that we are doing in Ukraine to protect us every week more and more intensively. This includes our weapons - from artillery and shells to drones and missiles... This also applies to our unity. In particular, unity in rejecting everything and everyone that weakens Ukraine. Secondly, we are constantly proving that we can do things together that seem fantastic to the rest of the world, but work in reality when Ukrainians take them on. Four ships have already passed through our new, alternative sea corridor from our southern seaports. And we are working with our partners around the world to restore the normal operation of the Grain Corridor, which has ensured and should ensure food security on a global scale. I thank everyone who is helping with this. Third, Ukraine has to achieve several very specific results in the coming months. In particular, it is our strategic political goal to launch membership negotiations with the European Union. Ukraine has seven specific recommendations from the European Commission. We have already implemented some of them. The other part requires effective work of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Timely work, which we have agreed with the European Commission. The law on the restoration of electronic declaration, amendments to the law on national minorities, and, I would like to draw special attention to it, the law on PEPs - politically exposed persons. Each of these laws is of fundamental importance. And voting on them will be of fundamental importance. People will see who is worth what. And I urge Ukrainian MPs not to postpone these decisions, not to let Ukraine down, and to support our European integration. One more thing is very important. This week, the Parliament will be offered to make a personnel decision. I want to outline it now. I have decided to replace the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. Oleksiy Reznikov has gone through more than 550 days of full-scale war. I believe that the Ministry needs new approaches and other formats of interaction with both the military and society at large. Now Rustem Umerov should lead the Ministry. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine knows this person well, and Mr. Umerov does not need any additional introductions. I expect the Parliament to support this candidate. Autumn is a time for strengthening. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today we spent the whole day with our warriors; it is very useful to hear from those who are going into battle what exactly is lacking - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-04</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we spent the whole day with our warriors. Combat brigades in Donetsk region. The 109th separate territorial defense brigade, the 110th separate mechanized brigade, the 36th, 37th, 38th brigades of our marines, the 79th airborne assault brigade, the 53rd mechanized brigade, and the 59th motorized infantry brigade. Each of them is powerful. I am proud of all of them. And thank you for your sincerity, guys! Zaporizhzhia direction. The 148th separate artillery brigade, the 82nd airborne assault brigade, the 71st separate hunting brigade - thank you for your service! To all of you! It is extremely important to support our warriors, to communicate with the brigade and battalion commanders. It is very, very useful to hear from those who are going into battle directly what exactly is lacking, what exactly is enough and what exactly needs to be changed. Everything the warriors talked about will be issues for the participants of the Staff. Especially regarding electronic warfare - we heard everything, guys. I awarded our military doctors and thanked the staff of the stabilization points - they are great people who save heroes, restore lives and strength. It is a true Ukrainian, Cossack, spirit when the guys recover from their injuries and return to their positions to join their brothers-in-arms. And destroy the occupier again. It is an honor to thank such warriors! I honored the bravery of our warriors with more than 50 awards. I presented &quot;Gold Stars&quot; to the Heroes of Ukraine - Major Oleh Dmytruk, Air Assault Forces, and Colonel Viktor Sikoza, Marines. Thank you, warriors! All such awards, all honors are symbols of Ukraine&#x27;s success, proof of the strength and indomitability of our people. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! To everyone who works for our Ukrainian strength. To everyone in the world who constantly helps us! Who stands with us! And thank you personally for the chevrons, our guys, girls - all the warriors, thank you for the flags today. I will cherish it all. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No one can be left alone with war and its consequences in mind and soul – speech of President of Ukraine at third Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-06</span></div>
  <p>Glory to Ukraine! Dear our guests, Dear our first ladies and gentlemen, Dear Olena! Dear Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette, Everyone present. I am very pleased to welcome all of you – thank you for the invitation – to welcome everyone to the third Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen! I am glad that Ukrainian soft power manages to be effective. Decisions always propel history forward. But each of these strong decisions is primarily the energy of the emotion flared up before its adoption, effectively paving the way for the decision. It can be a very strong outburst. Or it can be barely noticeable, but no less important emotion. There are very special emotions that bring people to the square and add new colors to the streets with flags and slogans. And there are emotions that are important to be felt by only one person or one parliament, and then history becomes entirely different. Ukraine knows how to make history different. In particular, through the diplomacy of emotions – the soft power of our state, which can speak to the soul of every nation. Speak in a way that in a world suffering from an excess of aggression, it is possible to fill the deficit of solutions that benefit people. It is the people who benefit. And after the people, the states benefit. And for decisions to be implemented, one probably cannot build anything solely on the foundation of emotions. And just making decisions is not enough. Systematic action is always needed to turn the emotion into decisions, and decisions, in turn, into concrete results. Our soft power has such a systematic nature. And this is what truly strengthens Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am pleased that this format – the Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen – has truly become a platform for coordinating the soft power of Ukraine and our partner states. And today, Denmark, the Czech Republic, the United States, Lithuania, Estonia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Armenia, Moldova, Poland are represented here. I want to thank them. Public leaders from various countries, including from the United Kingdom, from France. I thank all of you for making this format happen! We thank you. The format has indeed become a reality. And the summit, and Olena&#x27;s team, and Olena – thank you for organizing it. It is very important. The summit shows the world how significant the potential is in people who may not govern institutions but possess a power greater than any institution can provide – the power of sincerity. Although first ladies and gentlemen of states may not be politicians in the conventional sense, they often find such arguments and tones that politicians genuinely cannot. And it works. And this is the result. By the way, thanks to Olena and her communication efforts in America, significant progress has been made in the issue of modern air defense for Ukraine. Achieving this required a lot of teamwork – of course, at various levels of the state – and the element of soft power played a role in opening up space for others. Another example. Political. The Republic of Korea. Essentially, relations between our states have been restarted. The most successful visits by representatives of Ukraine – our government and the visit to Seoul by the First Lady and the Ukrainian delegation – laid the groundwork for this. Meetings, interactions with Korean politicians and society. It is what opened a new history. And this continued with the visit of the President of the Republic of Korea to Ukraine during the war and our important agreements. The previous Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen was dedicated to Ukraine&#x27;s reconstruction after hostilities. It is a colossal scale of problems and a truly tremendous need for global support. I am grateful to the states, thankful to the leaders who have already declared their participation in Ukraine&#x27;s recovery and transformation after the war. Our foreign policy is working to make Ukraine&#x27;s recovery a truly global project. And here, I want us to thank Mette – she is here. We will have the first office for recovery. It will be in Mykolaiv. Thank you so much Mette! In addition to the level of states and international organizations, there is also the level of social leaders and businesses – philanthropists and companies that are guided, in particular, by moral motives for their choices. Thanks to our soft power, Ukraine now has such allies in recovery. And thanks to the ability to work systematically and make decisions a reality, among the various concrete results of our soft power, there are, in particular, the ambulances purchased for Ukraine, for our people, for our heroes, for our military. And I believe it would be fair to applaud and support them – those who defend Ukraine every day. And to thank the leaders for what you do. And indeed – shelters built in schools already guaranteeing protection for children, and equipped hospitals already operating for the Ukrainian strength. This Summit opens another very important space – a space for action, and in my opinion, it is no less extensive than the points I mentioned earlier. The topic of mental health and the government&#x27;s attention to this issue is much more than medicine, therapy and practices that should be accessible to people in today&#x27;s society. Especially in a society that is going through the most difficult times – going through a war. It is about what society can and should do. And what society should definitely be wary of. I not accidently began today with an emphasis on the power and importance of emotions. Mental and emotional burden is one of the heaviest baggage left by war. And, unfortunately, not everyone can bear this baggage. We know from the history of wars how such baggage really became a burden, both for individuals and for societies. A devastating burden. Just as every decision that moves history forward is preceded by some emotional outburst, pushing the decision into life, emotions can break any story. Break the story of a person, break a story of a family, a story of life, a story of peace. Post-war peace is vulnerable to emotions. To the accumulated pain of war that stays with people for a long time and becomes even more unbearable over time. War is a challenge that never completely disappears even after the end of hostilities and peace taking root. War smoulders as long as it can hit people from within. As long as they suffer because of the war. As long as the losses caused by war hurt. That&#x27;s why no one should be left alone with war, with its consequences. With what war does to a person&#x27;s mind and soul. Every city and village in Ukraine erased by Russian artillery is reflected in scorched souls. Each loss of a comrade in battle can become a chasm between the warrior and the society that continues to live its life and does not notice this. Every time a child sees blood from injuries, he or she sees the worst of the adult world far too early. Unfortunately, there are countless such horrific, tragic examples. People&#x27;s resilience has its limits. Everyone has their own limit. But in everyone, that limit lies in emotions, in that invisible baggage of feelings that prompt a person to act. To act one way or another – for good or for evil, for the benefit or harm. To the detriment of yourself or, God forbid, your loved ones, society. Whether it will be one way or another is determined by a person&#x27;s inner world, their mental health. It is worth taking care that it is a person&#x27;s health, not a chronic illness of war. And I am grateful that this Summit and such a representative discussion is dedicated to the topic of mental health. It is a special direction that requires a special approach. New attention – and not only the attention of our state. New institutions. A new field of rehabilitation. Staff training and expanding therapy. A new social policy. A new international collaboration, not just assistance. New arrangements. Unwavering respect for people and better understanding of people and unwavering sincerity. That is, alongside other work – the diplomacy of emotions and systematic efforts of soft power, directed not just for the sake of external relations, but for the sake of people&#x27;s inner world. So that people can prevail. People! Together with their state. War always discards the non-essential, war always discards the hollow. But it also leaves people with what they need to know how to discard. To discard what destroys. Destroys lives. It is necessary to build a system that saves from these ruins. And let every emotional outburst help to make the movement forward brighter! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Restrictions against Ukrainian exports now are scaling up of destruction caused by Russian terrorists – address of the President of Ukraine to participants of the Summit of the Three Seas Initiative</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-06</span></div>
  <p>Thank you! Dear Mr. President Iohannis, Thank you for this invitation, for your attention to Ukraine and the opportunity to address the participants of the Three Seas Summit. Dear colleagues! At this time, in our city of Kiliya, Odesa region, a city on the banks of the Danube, just across the river from Romania, a fire is being fought. The fire that started at night. After the Russian “Shahed” attack. Exactly on our infrastructure, which ensures the life of the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea and Danube regions... Actually, this is a fire in the body of our Three Seas. And these consequences of the attacks on Kiliya, on Reni, on Izmail, on Odesa, – on those cities that open the southern gate to the world for Ukraine, – are very vivid. Now Russia is hitting Ukraine. But what would have happened if it had succeeded, as it did earlier in history, in making Ukraine its foothold? That&#x27;s what Putin was planning. Something that, unfortunately, your peoples have already seen! Along with the Ukrainian one. In the past. In the past, which became a time of captivity, because at key moments there was a lack of solidarity. February 24th changed everything. Europe – all of us – managed to prove that we are capable of historic acts of solidarity. And now, when Ukraine is grateful to your countries, grateful to you personally for your support, this is the gratitude we feel… We! And this is a very broad “we”. It includes not only Ukrainians, but your nations as well. We stand together. Our common freedom. Our common European home. The home in which people have learned for centuries to rely not on the strength of walls, but on the strength of ties… not on what can be limited but on what can be expanded. Cooperation gives more protection and strength, than any kind of self-isolation. But have we really learned this? This format of cooperation is called Three Seas, not “Three Walls” or “Penta Walls”. This format is about unity, not division. Like all other formats that strengthen our nations. So why, when Ukrainian ports are burning almost every night after Russian strikes, do we also have to worry that our land logistics will stop? When politics in Europe goes against the grain and ignores common commitments and shared values... when it happens in the midst of a brutal aggression against everything that is European, – everyone loses. Everyone! And only time separates us from the moment when the consequences of such a loss – will be revealed. Ukraine is strongly against any further restrictions on the export of our grain! We calmly watch as our grain becomes a source of good income for various European countries that process our agricultural products and make money on logistics. Farmers in different countries use Ukrainian feed for the benefit of their farms. Companies from different countries make money on transit. And this is a benefit for the entire European economy… But specifically for the Ukrainian segment of the European economy, it is not about making money, but about survival – in the face of Russian terror. Only today and only one Russian shelling killed at least 16 people in Kostiantynivka town, in Donetsk region. And more than 20 people - this is the information for this time - more than 20 people were injured. Ordinary shops, a town market became a target. Please, do not turn Ukraine into a target either – economically or politically. I am now directly addressing you, my friends, partners, my colleagues... You, Mr. President of Romania, you, Ms. Deputy Prime Minister of Bulgaria. You, Madam President of Slovakia. You, Mr. President of Poland. You, Madam President of Hungary. You, Madam President of Moldova... Everyone on whom the freedom of our agricultural exports depends in one way or another… Any restrictions against Ukrainian exports now are a scaling-up of the destruction caused by Russian terrorists. This is exactly what it is. And I would like to address the European Commission specifically. The foundation of Europe is, among other things, free competition and fulfillment of promises. Ukraine fulfills its promises and never interferes with free competition. But how can we not-calmly accept the violation of the promises given to us, the violation of the Association Agreement, the violation of free market conditions... European institutions should not multiply disappointments in Europe. And should increase confidence in the words and promises that are made in Europe. Ukraine is fighting for life and for our common European values on the battlefield. It is fighting at sea and on land. It is fighting in the air. In cyberspace. In the information environment. In the sphere of commerce. But if we have to fight for Ukraine and the foundations of our common Europe in arbitration, we will fight. We don’t want to, but we will fight in arbitration. If we need to fight on the platforms of international organizations, we will fight there as well. But we hope for unity. And we hope that unity will win. That truth will win. May solidarity continue to unite us! May the whole Europe, from the Danube to the Vistula, continue to be a space of cooperation. Let the blame for the suffering in Europe be only on Russia. And I am grateful to each of you who helps us! Mr. President Iohannis, thank you so much for the invitation. We count on you, our friends! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Every manifestation of the world&#x27;s consolidation really helps save lives – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-06</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today was a difficult day. As of now, over 30 people have been wounded in Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region, after the attack by Russian terrorists. 16 people have been killed. My condolences to all who lost their loved ones! All services were working at the scene, clearing the rubble and rescuing people. I am grateful to everyone in the world who condemned this latest manifestation of Russian evil and supports Ukraine, our people. And it is very important that the response to Russian terror was even greater consolidation of the world. Every manifestation of such consolidation really helps save lives. Today, in Ukraine, in Kyiv, there are several important international events. Visits of partners. Denmark – Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. The United States – Secretary of State Blinken. The First Ladies and Gentlemen of the partner states who participated in this year&#x27;s Summit – and this is the third Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen – dedicated to the extremely important and sensitive topic of how we are going through this war, how our hearts and souls are experiencing the war. Therefore, how to overcome the pain of war. Mental health, the mental resilience of people, it is something that requires work just as much as any other manifestation of our resilience. Today, I also addressed the leaders of the Summit of the Three Seas Initiative, a large region that is one of the sources of European strength. The Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Adriatic Sea – all the countries in our part of Europe. The Summit took place in Romania. I called on all our partners, our neighbors to continue to preserve unity in Europe. On this day, we have new defense agreements. New political and humanitarian agreements. We are also preparing new international communications to make this week more active from the perspective of our foreign policy work. So that our soldiers, all our people feel more strengthened. I thank everyone who helps and will help! Thank you to all whose strength is Ukrainian! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The results are what Ukraine needs from everyone, at all levels - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-07</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! A brief report for this day. I congratulated our intelligence officers, our heroes, on the Day of Military Intelligence of Ukraine. We all realize how cool our intelligence officers are. True bravery, powerful results. I thanked the MID on behalf of the whole of Ukraine. Today I officially introduced the new Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umerov. He is a strong person. A systemic person. He has a good understanding of the defense sector. From the first days of the full-scale war, he has been involved in negotiations on weapons for Ukraine. Very sensitive negotiations. Productive. He is also engaged in negotiations on the release of our people from Russian captivity. Rustem also has important results for Ukraine in this regard. He can reboot the work of the Ministry of Defense. This is exactly what is needed now. Today&#x27;s international talks include a conversation with British Prime Minister Sunak and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Of course, the main topic is security. I held several important meetings on our international work. This September we have to achieve several very specific results in our work with partners. This includes new weapons for Ukraine - we are preparing the news. And our diplomatic efforts to unite even more countries to restore peace on our entire land. We are preparing more global pressure on Russia. And our warriors... the National Guard… The 12th special purpose brigade fighting in the east of our country... As well as the 3rd and 15th brigades of the National Guard fighting in the southern areas... I thank you, warriors, for the very, very effective destruction of the occupiers! The results are what Ukraine needs from everyone right now. At all levels. From everyone who is fighting for Ukraine, who is working for Ukraine, who is supporting us in the world. Glory to all those who bring our common victory closer with their personal results! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>For many in the world, Ukraine is now a personal moral choice - President&#x27;s speech at the Yalta European Strategy Forum</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-08</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you very much for the invitation and I welcome you all to the annual Yalta European Strategy Forum. The theme of this year&#x27;s Forum is &quot;The Future is Decided in Ukraine&quot;. But when we say &quot;in Ukraine&quot; now, do we mean only the state of Ukraine? The war against Ukraine is a war against morality. And the defense of Ukraine is, above all, the defense of morality. In fact, when people talk about Ukraine, they are talking about the aggression against our country and our ability to win. About the courage of Ukrainians. About our land, sky, our Black Sea. That is, about the human and geographical space of our country, where the fate of not only Ukraine&#x27;s independence, but also global stability and the rules by which most of the world is accustomed to live peacefully is decided. However, there is something that is not so obvious in the conversations about Ukraine today. For many in the world, Ukraine is not just a country in Europe that is defending itself against Russian aggression. For many, Ukraine is now a personal moral choice. A choice of what is really valuable to them. A choice of what they really want to believe in. A choice of what you put as your highest and true priority. Ukraine now symbolizes a standard of freedom in which people from different countries recognize their own standards. Recognize their attitude to life and the value of life. A decent, protected life. A life in which people matter. So when we talk about Ukraine now, we are actually talking about a huge moral space, and it is much wider than just the territory of Ukraine. This is the space from the Ukrainian trenches in Donbas, in the east to discussions in the world&#x27;s leading political offices and even between friends, if they are talking about some fundamental things. This is the space that starts from the positions of our anti-aircraft gunners in Odesa region, who are protecting ports from Russian missiles and Iranian &quot;Shaheds&quot;, and goes all the way to the positions of state representatives in international organizations who have to defend international law and things like global food security. This is the space between our Ukrainian people, who are defending the state and life, and those in the world who are strengthening us with their weapons, their sanctions against Russia, their leadership that consolidates others. And this is a space that begins with Ukrainian combat medics driving evacuation vehicles to take wounded soldiers off the battlefield and ends with gadget screens in the hands of people who see something about Ukraine and at that moment choose which interview to watch, which tweet to like, which news to share, which donation to make. All of this is a huge space of constant daily moral choices for many people in many countries. And it is in this wide space that the future is born. Dear guests! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Remember where we were on February 24, when this terrible and brazen full-scale Russian aggression against our people, against our lives, against everyone, against Ukraine began. Putin expected Ukraine to be left alone, because some of its partners would be indifferent, some would be afraid, some would act too slowly. And if that had been the case, Ukraine could have been occupied. Then Russia&#x27;s military madness would have turned into further aggression against other neighboring countries. The war would have spread. But would it have targeted only the territory of states? This is the whole point. We are defending ourselves, among other things, because the vast moral space of the world has united and is helping to defend Ukraine. Ukraine and thus a reflection of our own values. And Putin is attacking not only Ukraine, but also this moral space, which is ultimately capable of bringing to justice any terrorists and murderers, any aggressors. It is capable when it is morally mobilized. When we are talking about this war, we are always talking about morality. Everything that is said about Ukraine and this war has either a moral basis, a moral digression, or a shocking lack of morality. In fact, choosing between any of the options: supporting Ukraine or choosing indifference instead, acting together or instead expecting all necessary actions to be taken by Ukraine alone, insisting that Russia must be held accountable for genocide - because it is genocide! - or hinting that the main thing is to cut costs, and the problem of genocidal aggression will supposedly disappear if you close your eyes for a minute - all of this is definitely about morality. And all this is about the future, in which human life and international relations will either have a moral basis or... not. Then all of humanity may remain slaves to such &quot;putins&quot; who are capable of killing for their own whims. Please, every time you talk about Ukraine, remember what you are talking about. Human morality must win this war. And this is not only a matter for Ukraine as a state, it is a matter for Ukraine as all of us. Everyone in the world who values freedom, who values human life, who believes that people must win. And our success, the specific success of Ukraine, depends not only on us, on Ukrainians, but also on the extent to which the entire vast moral space of the world wants to preserve itself. On the extent to which the world remains morally mobilized. And I strongly believe in this. And that is why we are here. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world&#x27;s sanctions offensive must resume – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-08</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! It&#x27;s been a very active day today, with a lot of international communication – Ukraine needs to be heard and understood worldwide. Shared emotions are always a great source of greater support. Yalta European Strategy Summit - various meetings, interviews. A meeting with the members of our sanctions group led by Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul. A report on what has already been achieved in our work with partners for sanctions against Russia. Milestones for the near future. Currently, we see a prolonged sanctions pause from our partners. And Russia&#x27;s overly active attempts to circumvent the sanctions. It&#x27;s crucial to add solutions to the free world, which should defend itself. And have success in this! And, even more so, it should avoid any attempts to use free world companies, technologies, and products to wage war against freedom. Three priorities: further sanctions against Russia&#x27;s energy sector, real restrictions on the supply of chips and microelectronics in general to terrorists, and further blocking of the Russian financial sector. This world&#x27;s sanctions offensive must resume. On the eve of the Sports Day, I met with the community of our athletes. Those who bring glory to the world for Ukraine deserve applause on the arenas for our flag. Today, I also held an important preparatory meeting regarding an upcoming international event planned for this September. Details will follow shortly. We are preparing an important defense package for our soldiers. And one more thing. Chevron badges. Guys, our brigades, which I recently visited in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions – your chevron badges are already here, in my office, on the boards. I am proud of every brigade, every soldier! Glory to all who fight for our state! I thank each and every one who works for the Ukrainian strength! And to all who help our people overcome this time, overcome the consequences of Russian terror. We will definitely win! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Partnership of Ukraine and Japan will become a global example of protecting life and creating new opportunities for nations – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-09</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! We do not miss a single day for Ukraine. Just had a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan and representatives of Japanese business. Devoted to our resilience. Recovery, and development. Energy, transport, demining, social sphere, the creation of new jobs in Ukraine – I presented specific areas where we can do more together. Telecom, information security, protection of our infrastructure, green energy, engineering, the agricultural sector are crucial. I am confident that our partnership – between Ukraine and Japan – will become a global example. An example of how to protect life and create new opportunities for nations. For free nations. A very important security result today – we agreed to start preparing a bilateral document with Japan on security guarantees. We are already working with the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Now – with Japan. In recent days, the Speaker of the Parliament of Ukraine, Ruslan Stefanchuk, visited Japan, for a summit of the G7 parliamentary heads. The summit resulted in a strong declaration. Important meetings took place. A clear support for Ukraine and strong signals that the entire Ukrainian territory must be cleared of Russian troops, and only this opens the way to achieve a just and reliable peace. I also want to mention the audience with His Majesty the Emperor of Japan – attended by speakers of the G7 parliaments, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, the President of the European Parliament. Very symbolic. And it speaks volumes about what we have achieved. All together. Everyone who fights for Ukraine, who works for Ukraine. I also held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff today. Resilience is the key issue. First of all, our energy resilience. What needs to be done before winter, and what has already been done. Detailed reports from government officials, managers of energy companies. Of course, there was a military component. Our intelligence. We are fully aware that the Russian evil is also preparing for winter – preparing to inflict suffering. And now everyone in the public sector and in local authorities must do everything possible, and when necessary, even the impossible, to help Ukraine withstand the winter and maintain full functionality. Air defense, preparation of the energy sector, social system, appropriate support packages from partners – all officials and commanders have clear tasks. T Regional administration heads will report daily on preparedness, every evening – a report for the government, and the Office. The Minister of Internal Affairs has been instructed to maximize the preparation of the State Emergency Service sector – not only for the Emergency Service&#x27;s immediate work but also for clearly informing people about how protection will be provided. And I want to thank our partners – we have another agreement, Ukraine will receive more &quot;cheetahs&quot; to protect our energy network. But we are mobilizing all our forces. To increase the supply of various air defense systems and physical protection of objects even further. One more thing. For many years, in our country, two professional communities have been celebrating their day simultaneously on the second Saturday of September. This is the Day of Physical Culture and Sports and the Day of Ukrainian Cinema. And there are too many such coincidences in our calendar. The Day of the Lawyer and the Day of the Artist. The Day of the Builder and the Day of Veterinary Medicine Workers. There are coincidences of professional days and days of remembrance. For example, next year, in May, the Day of Remembrance for the Victims of the Genocide of the Crimean Tatar People coincides with the Day of Science. Obviously, there are many unacceptable confusions in meaning. Some professional communities celebrate their day according to Soviet templates. Some incredibly important days of remembrance and days of Ukrainian achievements are not reflected in our official calendar at all. Some professional communities, whose work deserves both respect and attention, do not yet have their professional day – for example, the community of Ukrainian historians. In fact, I have instructed the government of Ukraine, relevant public institutions to review this entire system of state attention and update it fairly and logically. And today I thank everyone who brings sports victories to Ukraine, who trains our athletes, who teaches children the correct sports strength and now – this is extremely important – adds Ukrainian sports infrastructure, relevant experience of our sports, experience of physical culture to the new system of rehabilitation, to the system recovery of Ukrainian men and women after injuries. And today, on the Day of Ukrainian Cinema, I thank all the employees of our film industry for every combination of emotions that our people, adults and children, are now feeling while watching Ukrainian movies, Ukrainian TV series, and Ukrainian documentaries. A nation with its own strong and emotional cinema will also have its own confident destiny in this world, its own dreams and its own vision of life. Glory to all who strengthen Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who fights for our country and who achieves the results Ukraine needs! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Front: over the past seven days, we have advanced - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-10</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! At the end of this week, it is important to say a few things. First of all, the frontline. Over the past seven days, we have advanced. There is movement in the Tavria directions. There is movement in the Bakhmut direction. Kupyansk and Lyman directions, Avdiivka and Maryinka - we are holding our ground there. I am grateful to all the warriors who make this possible! Every week, our warriors continuously keep the initiative in the hands of Ukraine. It is Ukrainian heroism that determines how this war will end. We must all remember this. Secondly, I want to thank all our people who have been helping to overcome the consequences of Russian shelling and rescuing people over the past week. Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk region, Donetsk region, cities of Odesa region. Thank you! Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region. Paramedic Ruslan Hubanov, Police Lieutenant. After the Russian terrorists attacked, he rescued the wounded and pulled people out of the rubble. In total, he saved 82 people during his time on duty. Thank you, Ruslan! Police Lieutenant Oleh Sizov also works as a paramedic. He saved 153 people during his time on duty. Just imagine how many lives are saved by one person. Thank you, Oleh! Police Captain Olena Vasylenko arrives at the sites of the attacks, documents the consequences of the shelling, and helps the wounded. She herself came under artillery fire, was wounded, and returned to duty. Thank you, Olena! And I thank the guys, the Ukrainian rescuers who were the first to arrive after the Russian attack on Kostiantynivka, on the market: firefighter-rescuer Roman Dychko, Chief Master Sergeant Denys Sukhanov, Captain of the Civil Defense Service Serhiy Chikin. Brutal shelling of Kryvyi Rih. One person was killed. My condolences to the family... 60 wounded. I thank each and every one of you who helped save people! And I would like to especially mention Vadym Kuchkurda, Yevheniy Huba and Vladyslav Kurasov, employees of our State Emergency Service. The guys rescued three people from under the rubble. Thank you! I would also like to mention police officers Bohdan Kovalenko and Valeriy Velykyi. They were among the first to arrive at the site of the attack and began to get people out of the rubble. Sumy. Police Senior Lieutenant Yaroslav Kuts arrived at the site of the Russian shelling and quickly extinguished the fire in close proximity to people trapped under the rubble. I thank you for this speed, Yaroslav! I would also like to recognize the employees of the Sumy region&#x27;s State Emergency Service: Sergeants of the Civil Defense Service Pavlo Zhuk and Ihor Tokarenko, and Colonel of the Civil Defense Service Serhiy Halat. Thank you guys for saving the lives of our people! Odesa region, the city of Kiliya. Andriy Nosov, Andriy Mosienko, Andriy Vasylenko - our firefighters. Thank you, guys! The city of Reni.

I also thank every Ukrainian doctor, every nurse and all Ukrainian combat medics who save the lives of our people and restore their strength! This is truly a great job. And one more thing. Today, near the city of Chasiv Yar in Donetsk region, Russian terrorists attacked a volunteer vehicle. A direct hit from an anti-tank missile system. As of this time, we know for sure that Anthony Ignat of Canada was killed. Unfortunately, Emma Igual of Spain is also likely to have been killed. My condolences to their families. Two other volunteers were taken to Dnipro hospitals - German citizen Mawick Ruben and Swedish citizen Johan Mathias - and they are being provided with the necessary assistance. This Russian shelling once again confirms how close the war against Ukraine is to everyone in the world who truly values human life and who believes it is the common moral duty of humanity to stop terror and defeat evil. Glory to all our warriors! Glory to all our people! I thank everyone in the world who helps Ukraine survive and protect lives! We will definitely prevail! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Paperwork in the military should be much less – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-11</span></div>
  <p>I wish you all good health, dear Ukrainians! Today, there is good news: we are preparing to strengthen the package of defense support from Germany. Air defense systems, artillery, equipment. What was agreed upon with Chancellor Scholz. What was discussed today with German Minister of Foreign Affairs Baerbock – she was on a visit to Ukraine, I met with her today in Kyiv. It&#x27;s crucial that partners hear the needs of our state, our soldiers, and the protection of our energy infrastructure. I am confident – there will be results.We are also making progress with our other partners, in particular, regarding air defense systems. Additional systems will be in Ukraine. Today, I held several important meetings. First of all, I would like to highlight the meeting with Ukraine&#x27;s Defense Minister Umerov, First Deputy Minister Pavliuk, and Deputy Prime Minister Fedorov regarding the provision of our soldiers and the transparency of this provision. The specific needs of our combat brigades should be met as quickly as possible, and for this, all accounting should be digitized. In general, there should be much less paperwork in the military, and there should be no difference between what is reported here in the center and what is really needed at the front. The Ministry of Defense is currently relaunching the accounting system, with assistance from the Ministry of Digital Transformation. Today, I also had a meeting with representatives of the law enforcement sector. Obviously, Ukraine needs more progress in protecting the interests of society. In protection from those who prioritize their own wallet above social norms and rules. Above even the war. There will be new steps of the state. And one more thing. Since this morning, various Ukrainian cities and regions have been hit by Russian attacks. Nikopol – brutal Russian shelling, artillery. Ochakiv in Mykolaiv region, Kherson, and other cities and villages in Kherson region, Polohy district in Zaporizhzhia region, Donetsk, Pokrovsk district, Bakhmut district, Volnovakha district, and others. Kharkiv region. Chernihiv region. Sumy region. Kryvy Rih – a missile strike. Another attack by Shaheds. Even when there is a relative peace and quiet in some parts of our territory, we should always remember our land, our cities, and villages that are almost constantly under fire. And even though today is the 565th day of this war, all of us, each and every one in Ukraine, should remain focused on defending the state just as we did in the early days. Russia does not hope to win. The enemy hopes only that we will not endure. Ukraine must endure. Anything that strengthens us is a priority. And only that is a priority. No weakening! And we won&#x27;t allow anyone to weaken Ukraine. Glory to all our soldiers! Thank you to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Declarations should be open immediately - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-12</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you! I vetoed a law passed by the Verkhovna Rada that contained restrictions on electronic declarations. I think everyone understands the reason for this veto: declarations should be open. Immediately. Not in a year. The registry should be opened now. Actually, the law should be voted on with this key amendment. Preferably, quickly. Have a nice day!</p>

  <h2>Unite for freedom, for common achievements - President&#x27;s address to the university community of the Netherlands</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-12</span></div>
  <p>Madam Rector! Thank you for your kind words. Greetings, Netherlands! Dear students! I would like to dedicate this address primarily to you - those who are still very young and starting their academic year. But in a very short time - and believe me, you won&#x27;t even notice how quickly this time will pass - you yourself may be addressing others who are starting their academic year... Perhaps these will be the words that you, as parents, may say to your children. Perhaps you will be working at a university, teaching the disciplines you are currently studying, and then you will greet new students who have come to you for the first time. And you may become leaders in politics, business or civic activism who are invited to address students at such solemn moments... This is your life, and what it will be like, what will become your destiny over time, and what you will be able to say to others depends only on you and no one else. In today&#x27;s world, there is definitely no shortage of advice, let alone motivational speeches. People are telling you how to live and what to do or not to do everywhere. Even when it is absolutely inappropriate. And I&#x27;m sure all of you have heard many times what you should do to make sure you will succeed in someone else&#x27;s opinion. And sometimes this is even the right advice. Sometimes you really need to listen to others... But still, if you don&#x27;t understand what path you are on and what your own boundaries of right and wrong are, everything you have can simply drown in the flow of life – dissolve in time. And it is very frightening when people look back at their lives and do not see their own lives... they see something else instead. This is exactly the same for countries. Just like for people. Every country needs the ability to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Just like a person. No matter what the situation is and no matter what others offer, you need to know the boundaries of your &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;, your own interest. Every country needs to know what it is worth, what exactly belongs to it in this world. Just like every individual. Because if you don&#x27;t understand what is yours, you won&#x27;t be able to defend your choice. Each country has its own level of freedom – some have more, some have less. Someone inherited it. Someone fights for freedom... But whatever the country, freedom is never a gift. It always needs to be protected. It always needs to be appreciated, it&#x27;s always necessary to realize what gives freedom its strength, and it&#x27;s necessary to constantly increase guarantees for freedom. So that there is no moment when the country loses its freedom. And it is the same with every person – you need to understand what gives you the power to be free, so that you can always be free. And we must always – always! – be able to find reasons for unity. All countries. And all people. The modern world is overly divisive. It happens every moment... When your social networks create an informational and, even more importantly, emotional picture of life tailored to you... When your social circle gradually grows into a social bubble in which you hardly feel how others live in other bubbles... And when your work, your habits, your place in life become not just something that distinguishes you from others, but something that completely closes you off from other lives. This is the case with people. But isn&#x27;t it the same with countries? The world lacks unity... It lacks the ability to feel the other and make the other your ally. It lacks the ability to put ambitions at the service of common values. Now the world is going through a special stage, when it is being decided not only whether we alone, somewhere in Eastern Europe, will preserve freedom... Now it is being determined whether it will be possible to make genocidal policy part of the allegedly normal world politics. This is exactly what Russia is trying to do with its war against us... To make genocide a background against which others can live in peace somewhere in their &quot;bubbles&quot;... To freeze the war and turn death from a shocking picture of battles into the almost imperceptible reality of daily repression in the occupied territory. Is the world united against this? Not all of it. Not yet. But we are trying! This is one of the main things we are doing. Ukraine is looking for reasons for unity with different countries. Even with those that we have had almost no relations with for decades. We are building new ties. We are building new partnerships. The Netherlands, in particular, is helping us with this - your leadership, your participation helps us unite the world for the sake of our common values. And this makes our defense stronger, our freedom stronger. Would we be able to communicate like this today, on the five hundred and sixty-sixth day of a brutal full-scale war, if Ukraine did not work for unity? I sincerely wish you to see your own path. I wish you to be able to always say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; as it corresponds to your sense of life, your interests, your nature. But at the same time, please do not turn what is yours into a wall that closes others off you. Look for unity. Look for friends, partners, like-minded people. It doesn&#x27;t matter what country they are from... the Netherlands or Ukraine... it doesn&#x27;t matter if their name is Mark or Volodymyr... The main thing is your common result. Work together with others. Unite for the sake of freedom. For the sake of common achievements that may even become historical. Overcome the things that divide you so that in any crisis situation you will always have an ally by your side. When this is your skill on a personal level, it will invariably become your special strength on a community and national level. Dear students! Today, the Netherlands is among the global leaders in the defense of freedom and human life. Thanks to the generations you came to learn from. And I wish that when the next generation comes to learn from you, some foreign leaders will be able to thank your country in the same way... for jointly defending freedom, for supporting human life, and for giving every person and every country this fundamental choice in life - to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; when it concerns the path to the future. One&#x27;s own future. The real one. The one we are fighting for for Ukraine right now. And we will definitely prevail! Thank you for your attention and thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>A new historic step between Ukraine and the EU should take place this year, and all branches of government should work for this step - address by the President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-12</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report for the day. First, the law on electronic declaration. As soon as the law was received from the Verkhovna Rada this morning, I signed a veto. I expect a new vote - one with a positive outcome regarding the immediate opening of the register of declarations. This decision should be made already in September. The same is true for the draft law on PEPs – politically exposed persons. And this is a matter not only of the political responsibility of the parliament, but also of our negotiations with the European Union on accession. A new historic step between Ukraine and the EU should take place this year, and all branches of government in Ukraine should work to make it happen. Before all other meetings, I held a Military Cabinet meeting today. A special circle of participants. We only discussed the situation at the front and our expectations for the near future. Strengthening of our brigades, our own production of weapons and ammunition in Ukraine and supplies from our partners. Important intelligence reports. We can clearly see what the occupiers are really preparing for and what our warriors should be ready for. Today, Denmark has made a significant decision - the largest defense package for the entire period of a full-scale war and already the twelfth. This new package is worth more than $800 million. In terms of content, it is exactly what we agreed on with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her government team. A good reinforcement, thank you for it! Today, I had a very productive conversation with students from Dutch universities. It was a broad format - several universities. The questions were quite political. There was really good attention to Ukraine, to our struggle for freedom. And there is a great hope that we will return peace to our entire land, to all our people, without exception. I am grateful to the Netherlands - to the society, to the political community, and to you, Mark, Mr. Prime Minister, personally, for such sincere support of Ukraine and for your faith in Ukraine and our people. And, of course, our warriors. Today, we have a lot to thank all the warriors of our 95th air assault brigade for. The 3rd assault brigade - well done, guys! &quot;Fury&quot; joint assault brigade of the National Police - thank you! All three brigades distinguished themselves in the battles in the Bakhmut sector. Those were important successful actions. The 46th separate airmobile brigade and the 47th separate mechanized brigade - thank you, warriors, for your advancement! The 72nd separate mechanized brigade and the 79th separate air assault brigade - thank you for the extremely strong defense of our positions! Today I would like to particularly mention the MID&#x27;s special units that are performing tasks in the area of Klishchiivka and other extremely hot spots. Thank you, guys! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Next year, we will add significant budget funds for the defense industry - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-13</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! It was an important day. The Military Cabinet - there were some details that I cannot talk about now, but that will be very effective in the war. I held a meeting with Prime Minister Shmyhal and Minister of Finance Marchenko on next year&#x27;s budget. I outlined the key parameters - what should be prioritized in the state budget. The key is to protect our state and people. Defense and security are the first priority, and the funding for defense and security will be at least at the level of this year, i.e. one trillion six hundred billion hryvnias. At least! Next year, we will add significant budget funds for the defense industry - for the production of weapons in Ukraine. And for the drones. Both for the purchase of what is needed abroad and for the Ukrainian production. In addition, almost 100 billion hryvnias will be allocated for the production of weapons, overseen by the Ministry of Strategic Industry, and for the Ukrainian drone army, which is showing very good, impressive results. I will support all of this. A separate budget priority is to support our veterans. We also keep social expenditures as a priority. At least 469 billion hryvnias. There will be additional funds for the healthcare system - at least 24 billion plus to this year&#x27;s expenditures. There will be a plus for the education system, primarily to support teachers and lecturers. We are investing the necessary funds in digitalization, including our Mriia, a new tool for children, parents, and teachers that we have already presented in advance. Next year, Mriia should be fully operational and available to Ukrainians in every corner of the world! Of course, there will be a significant indexation of pensions - we plan to do it in March, as required by law. But, in addition to all this, we place a very important economic emphasis in the budget. We are adding incentives for the economy - production, jobs, investments. All the things needed to help Ukraine recover faster. Government officials will present the details of such incentives. This includes the connection to the power grid for investors, the continuation of grant programs, mortgage programs, and the development of Ukrainian industrial parks. I instructed the Prime Minister to prepare the basis for raising the minimum wage in Ukraine in the first half of next year. Absolutely all elements of state work must be adjusted so that we can determine the timing of the end of this war here in Ukraine ourselves. With our victory. Our weapons that will reach all the goals necessary for Ukraine. Our economy that will be able to provide Ukrainians with the jobs they need. Social functions of the state that must be fulfilled. State functionality, especially digital functionality, which must become more advanced than anywhere else in Europe. All these are our tools to bring Ukraine&#x27;s victory closer. And our cooperation with our partners - with everyone in the world who is interested in peace with us. Today I held a meeting on Ukraine&#x27;s integration with the European Union and NATO. Another meeting, a long meeting, was about preparing negotiations with partners, different ones: from the G7, from the Global South. All this will happen. One more thing. As always, I want to thank our warriors. Today, I am especially grateful to our pilots. Well done, guys! We are all proud of you. I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Everyone who is now in combat, at combat posts, on combat missions. I thank everyone who trains our troops, who produces weapons for Ukraine, who finds in the world everything that Ukraine needs. I thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We need a powerful system of the warriors&#x27; rights protection in the defense sector itself - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-14</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A few highlights from the day. Our country celebrated the Day of Tank Forces today for the first time. Previously, there was a Soviet date for the professional day of tank forces. And now there is not just a motive to give a Ukrainian meaning to all such days, not just the desire of our people, but also the specific result of the Ukrainian warriors that should be honored at the level of the entire state. I honored our tank crewmen with state awards. Soldiers, sergeants, officers. Our bravest warriors! With the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Order &quot;For Courage&quot;, and the medal &quot;For Military Service to Ukraine&quot;. Two warriors – Sergeant Vladyslav Simak and Senior Sergeant Oleh Palamarchuk – received the Crosses of Combat Merit for their bravery and efficiency. I thank you guys! I thank all Ukrainian tank crewmen! It is very important that our tank forces are constantly progressing - training and using more advanced and modern tanks in combat. There will also be Abrams tanks under Ukrainian flags - we are constantly reinforcing our warriors. I held a meeting with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine and discussed some key issues. The decisions that our society in general and Ukrainian warriors in particular expect from the Ministry of Defense. The Minister will present them upon finalization of all the details. Today, I would like to emphasize the joint work of Rustem Umerov and the Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets on such a new institution as a military ombudsman. This is truly necessary. We need a powerful system of the warriors&#x27; rights protection in the defense sector itself. Today I met with representatives of the Ukrainian Jewish community - rabbis from different cities of Ukraine, and our warriors. It was a very warm meeting on the eve of Rosh Hashanah. It is important that all communities in Ukraine are united in the goal of defending Ukraine and ensuring a normal life for all our people. I awarded the warriors with state awards - the Orders &quot;For Courage&quot;. I thanked the representatives of religious organizations for supporting people here in Ukraine, supporting the state, and telling the whole world - the entire Jewish community of the world - the truth about Russia&#x27;s aggression and terror. Today we have a good result in our cooperation with the International Criminal Court. A result that brings accountability for Russian war crimes closer. The International Criminal Court has opened a field office in Ukraine, and it is the largest ICC office outside of The Hague. And it is great that there is full and coordinated cooperation between the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office, all Ukrainian law enforcement institutions and the International Criminal Court. It is this cooperation that helps us bring the moment of justice for Ukraine and all our people who have suffered from this war closer – the moment of lawful and deserved sentences for Russian criminals. One more thing. The entire staff of the Security Service of Ukraine and our Navy should be specially commended for this. I thank you for today&#x27;s triumph – the destruction of the occupiers&#x27; air defense system on the land of our Crimea. It is a very significant achievement, well done! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! And thank you to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Europe always wins when treaties work and promises are kept – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-15</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainian men and women! I had a phone call with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Restrictive measures against our agricultural exports by the European Union have been cancelled. Now, it is important that European unity works on a bilateral level – with the neighbors. That the neighbors would support Ukraine during the war. Europe always wins when treaties work and promises are kept. Well, if the neighbors&#x27; decisions are not neighborly, Ukraine will respond civilly. I held a lengthy meeting with government officials and the Office regarding our further tactics in protecting our agreements and free trade with the EU. By helping each other and safeguarding our shared freedom in Europe, especially economic freedom, we strengthen everyone in Europe. And this is particularly important now in the face of the genocidal aggression unleashed by Russia. I held a new meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff today. First and foremost is the front. Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, commanders – reports on the situation in the main directions. Chief of Defense Intelligence Budanov – a separate report. Minister for Strategic Industries Kamyshin – substantially about the production of weapons and rounds in Ukraine. Every week we record the progress of the state in its own defense production. There is a significant and much-needed result for Ukraine near Bakhmut – our soldiers liberated Andriivka. The 3rd assault division, all involved forces, headquarters, commander –General Syrsky. Guys, thank you all! Our active actions continue near Klishchiivka and Kurdiumivka. The 36th separate marine brigade operates strongly near Opytne and Vodiane. Thank you, guys! Near Verbove – our unyielding warriors, thank you! Near Novoprokopivka – well done! I am proud of all the warriors who bring our victory closer! Today, on the eve of the Rescuer&#x27;s Day, I congratulated the team of Ukraine&#x27;s State Emergency Service and thanked them for their courageous and selfless work. I took part in awarding laureates of the Ukrainian action &quot;Hero – Rescuer of the Year&quot;. And this event is much more than one of the official events. Our gratitude to the employees of the State Emergency Service. Every state and departmental award for rescuers is a reflection of the fact that people&#x27;s lives are protected. I had a meeting with Karim Khan, Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. We talked about the approach of justice for Ukraine and for all people who suffered from Russian war crimes. The responsibility must be clear, concrete, completely fair – just like the warrant for Putin&#x27;s arrest issued by the International Criminal Court. What the Russian dictator was really afraid of. And now, he tries not to leave Russia, because the force of law exists, and it is strong. And the world has every opportunity for the law to overcome the aggression of the bandit force. We are preparing for important international events scheduled for the second half of September. I had several long meetings about this today. We are doing everything to ensure that there are significant results for Ukraine – both in new defense packages from partners and in the decisions of international institutions. We also work to strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s institutions, for the ability of our state to finally destroy oligarchic and corrupt influences. Influences that, in particular, Russia used for so long to weaken Ukraine, to constantly &quot;eat away&quot; the sovereignty of our state. Today, I held a broad and meaningful meeting with representatives of law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the government, and the Office. We are preparing conceptual steps that will give Ukraine and our entire society more justice, and democracy in our state – guaranteed sustainability. One more. Today, the Ukrainian Jewish community, together with all the Jews of the world, celebrates Rosh Hashanah. I congratulate everyone who is celebrating, and I wish the next year will be peaceful – finally peaceful for all of Ukraine, for all our people. Ukraine deserves peace because it is doing everything for victory. I thank everyone who fights for freedom and independence! I thank everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our task is to provide Ukraine with all the opportunities to produce weapons and ammunition to have reliable protection against aggression – address of the President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-16</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainian men and women! Today is a meaningful day – we are preparing for a strong second half of September. Strong in terms of our international work with partners and the decisions we are implementing here in Ukraine. Dozens of negotiations have already been planned, and there is a clear schedule of meetings. There will also be clear and specific results. Another important point to mention. We are continuing to prepare for the Defense Industries Forum, the first event of its kind to take place in Ukraine. It will happen this autumn. Interest in the Forum is very high. This fully reflects Ukraine&#x27;s strength and potential – our ability to defend ourselves and help other countries preserve freedom and international order... Already, 86 leading defense companies from around the world – representing 21 countries – have confirmed their participation in the Forum. Our task is absolutely clear – to provide Ukraine with all the opportunities to produce weapons and ammunition, to provide modern technology to have reliable protection against any form of aggression. Moreover, of course, to share our defense experience among allies and partners. The world must be stronger than any threat to life from aggressors or terrorists. This week, we have made significant progress in implementing existing defense agreements and other support packages. Denmark – thank you for the new defense package, which is already the 12th package. Equipment, ammunition, and missiles for our air defense. Germany – thank you for the new batch of military aid. Belgium – your participation in our pilot training is approved. Thank you! Norway – your decision to provide additional funding for Ukraine&#x27;s recovery. It&#x27;s crucial. Thank you! South Korea – thank you for the new financial support agreement! The United States – the new sanctions decision to limit Russia&#x27;s ability to engage in terror. Thank you! And, of course, our warriors. All brigades and units currently in combat. Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions. And those who have already achieved important results for Ukraine this week, and those who, I am confident, are preparing to contribute to Ukraine&#x27;s success. Thank you! We are all proud of our warriors and are committed to strengthening our defense and security forces! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We we must reach a point when all children in our country have their own family, their own home - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-17</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I would like to express gratitude today. To everyone who defends the sky of our country. Our pilots and engineers of the Air Force, warriors of mobile fire groups, all our anti-aircraft gunners. Thank you for constantly increasing the number of downed Russian missiles and drones, and thus the number of our people and infrastructure saved. Thank you, warriors! And to everyone who is now on the front line. To every brigade. From Kupyansk to the left bank of Kherson region, from the Bakhmut sector to every Ukrainian position on the front line in the south of our country. I thank you guys for your might! And today I would like to especially recognize the warriors who are gradually regaining Ukraine&#x27;s territory in the area of Bakhmut. The 80th air assault brigade, the 5th separate assault brigade, the glorious 95th and &quot;Fury&quot; Joint Assault Brigade of the National Police. Klishchiivka! Well done! Today Ukraine marks Rescuer&#x27;s Day. And on Friday, I had the honor to personally thank the employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine and all those whose hearts simply feel that it is impossible otherwise, that we must take care of others, that we must help others when lives depend on it. Today, I want to thank not only all our rescuers, but also all the relatives - mothers and fathers of boys and girls, men and women working in the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. I thank you for raising your children this way: to save others, to make our entire society stronger and more humane. Thank you! Today - and this is a very symbolic coincidence - our country also marks Adoption Day. This is probably one of the most honorable missions in life - to help a child avoid an orphan&#x27;s fate. I thank everyone who helps children in this way, everyone who spreads the warmth of their families so that there are fewer lonely destinies in this world! As a state, we must reach a point when all children in our country, all those who have been left without parental care, have their own family - their own home, their own family. Ukraine certainly must not be associated with orphanages. I thank everyone who works for this! Glory to everyone who helps our people and the entire country become stronger! And we are preparing new defense decisions for Ukraine. Air defense and artillery are a priority. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

And all of them - gold, silver and bronze medals - primarily prove the invincibility of the Ukrainian morale and your fortitude, which is tougher than any circumstances. You are an example of extraordinary will for everyone. And it is inspiring. It is invigorating. It shows the whole world, and it allows Ukraine to know and not forget that a nation is born out of the invincible, and thanks to the invincible, nations withstand everything. And overcome everything! I am grateful to all of you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>
