  <h2>The recovery of Ukraine is not only about what needs to be done after the victory, but also about what we and our partners should do now - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-04</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a long and very important day of our foreign policy activity. A conference devoted to the recovery of Ukraine started in Lugano, Switzerland. I want to point out right away that when they talk about recovery, they often put the emphasis incorrectly. It is not only about what we should do after our victory or in the following years, but also about what we need to do right now. Ukrainian forces liberated more than a thousand settlements from the occupiers, and new ones are added every week. Now, for example, in the south of our country. All of them suffered large-scale destruction. And this also means the need for colossal funds for the restoration of infrastructure, for the return of medicine and social services, for the restoration of normal economic life. There are tens of thousands of destroyed houses alone in the liberated areas. And we also need to prepare schools and universities for the new academic year in the entire free territory of the country and in new conditions of constant threat, in particular missile strikes... We must already prepare for the winter and do everything so that we pass this winter calmly from the point of view of energy despite the threats Russia creates every day. A significant part of the economy has been destroyed by hostilities and Russian strikes, thousands of enterprises are out of business. And this means a high need for jobs, for ensuring social benefits despite the decrease in tax revenues. That is why the recovery of Ukraine is not only about what needs to be done later, after our victory, but also about what needs to be done at this time. And we have to do it together with our partners, with the entire democratic world. Do now. Today, Prime Minister of Sweden Mrs. Andersson visited Kyiv. The main topics are defense support - we will get a new enhanced package - we are grateful. As well as new sanctions against Russia and new opportunities for Ukraine, in particular in matters of waste processing. In our country, this topic was neglected for a very long time, and it is not just about what to do with garbage. It&#x27;s about safety, about quality of life. We need a minimum of 25 new and modern technologically advanced waste processing plants. They are able to provide both energy and secondary raw materials, and finally resolve the age-old problem of dumps and waste landfills, the inability of many communities to find solutions for waste. And if some people think this is untimely, I want to say that the reconstruction of our state is not just the restoration of the walls that we had and that were destroyed by shelling. Ukraine must become the freest, most modern and safest country in Europe - in every sense of the word, in particular, in terms of our environment. I&#x27;m sure we will do that. Today is July 4 - the main holiday for the United States of America, Independence Day. And I want to congratulate President Biden, the American people, and all our friends in the United States. I want to quote something. &quot;We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness—That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed,” the United States Declaration of Independence reads. And agree that Ukrainians have repeatedly demonstrated in their history that we have similar principles. It is enough to look at the Ukrainian Maidans or our tenacity in the defense of freedom. Congratulations again on Independence Day. Thanks for the help! Today, I congratulated Ukrainian policemen on National Police Day and presented the awards. Law and order is based on the quality of their work. Of course, a lot still needs to be done for the Ukrainian police to fully meet the requirements of modern times. But don’t forget about the police heroes who fight on the frontline. About those who ensure demining. Who help the victims of shelling. Who conduct the evacuation. Who deliver humanitarian aid. And who provide us all with protection from crime. The situation on the frontline did not undergo significant changes during the day. The enemy continues to terrorize the border areas of the Sumy region, the city of Kharkiv and the region, Donbas. The Armed Forces of Ukraine respond, put pressure and destroy the offensive potential of the occupiers day after day. We need to break them. This is a difficult task, it requires time and superhuman efforts. But we have no alternative - this is about our independence, about our future, about the fate of the entire Ukrainian people. I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by the President at the opening of the 26th Annual Economist Government Roundtable</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-05</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mrs. Presidents! Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the invitation to participate in this roundtable. Now, if we look at the news about the life of our societies on any day, we will see that they are dominated by two concepts - war and crisis. A full-scale war against our state and a hybrid war against the United Europe. And if we talk about crises, it is primarily a crisis of the cost of living, which is reflected by an extraordinary rise in prices. Energy crisis. Food crisis. Migration. This is what life looks like today. And we have not yet seen the possible wars or crises that Russia is able to prepare for many countries in the coming years. Is it likely that the leadership of Russia is planning a new invasion of the territory of another neighbor? No one can rule it out. Can Russia create another crisis for all of us in Europe? It can. It is enough to look at the Russian missiles that fly over the power units of nuclear plants in Ukraine. Look and understand: we don&#x27;t even have guaranteed radiation safety now. And how did all this happen? In response, I can also cite two concepts: gray zone and assurances. Europe has experienced a security deficit for decades. Part of Europe - in the east of the continent, as well as in the Balkans - was outside any effective security architecture. You can explain it as you like, but the presence of such gray zones from the point of view of Moscow looked like a temptation. And any gray zone - be it geographical, be it political, be it economic - is considered by the leadership of Russia as a space of its opportunities - anti-democratic, anti-legal, anti-European. In fact, it was the case that the security of a part of Europe was based only on &quot;assurances&quot;. You can recall various &quot;assurances&quot;. Those contained in the Budapest memorandum. The ones that sounded from the European leaders who said that business and dialogue with Russia would supposedly keep it from aggression. Or those that sounded from the Russian leadership, which claimed that it has allegedly abandoned its aggressive policy. It all collapsed. And not on February 24 this year, but back in 2014, when Russia occupied the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. And what do we have now? Again - two concepts. More unity and security guarantees. It is only through greater unity in Europe and effective security guarantees that we can respond to those threats that are currently destabilizing the continent. The future of Europe - calm and peaceful - is simply impossible without it. We need such a unity in Europe that will become the largest in history. Of course, a lot has already been done for this. But not everything yet. For example, what is happening on the energy market in Europe and is happening right now should be viewed as a war. With its gas game, Russia is doing everything to keep inflation growing and to make Europe experience the biggest crisis in history this winter. However, at the same time, we see Greek companies providing almost the largest tanker fleet for the transportation of Russian oil. Once again: this is happening precisely when another Russian energy resource is being used as a weapon against Europe and against the family budget of every European. I am sure that this does not meet the interests of Europe, Greece, or Ukraine. This is just one example of the need for even greater unity. So that Russia is forced to seek peaceful solutions - in particular, in the hybrid wars it is waging. And if we mention the Russian banking system, is it already cut off from the global financial market? No. Connections are still maintained. And therefore, there is still hope in Moscow that in the future it will somehow be possible to deceive the democratic world, somehow it will be possible to break the resistance, in particular, of European countries. Because if they made concessions in something, why won&#x27;t they make concessions in something else? This is the question. I will also give an example of how greater unity gives a very practical and very concrete result for everyone. Thanks to the recent accession of Ukraine to the common European energy system, the countries of the European Union can now receive our electricity. And this makes it possible to replace a part of Russian fossil fuels - a substantial part in the energy balance of European countries. And not at a &quot;cosmic&quot; price, but much cheaper than the cost of electricity on the European market. Let&#x27;s look at the second tool - security guarantees. Would Moscow attack someone who would be definitely protected? We see now that Russia has accepted this situation and this decision - that Sweden and Finland are joining NATO. Moscow says - &quot;let them join&quot;. Although earlier Russia said that the Alliance must return to the borders of 1997. This proves the fact that collective security guarantees work. Yes, Ukraine is not in NATO. And when we reached out to start a movement towards membership, we got a negative response even to the request for a Membership Action Plan. But this is not a reason for us to stop. We need such a system of security guarantees, such a safe space, which can be effective even in conditions when we are not in the Alliance. The main goal is to have no gray safety zone. We are not in NATO, but we are on this path. And there must be certainty. And certainty now. What to do to prevent aggression? What should be done to immediately stop the aggression that has started? We want to give answers to this - and we are currently working on them with our partners. With those states that, in fact, will be able to become guarantors. If there was such a system now, there would be no war. If Ukraine had received guaranteed support with weapons, sanctions against the aggressor, immediate isolation of the aggressor, confiscation of the assets of the aggressor and all entities related to it, Ukraine would not be a victim of the most terrible war in Europe. The most terrible since World War II. All this horror would not have happened. And we must do everything so that it never happens again. This is the main task. Ladies and Gentlemen! We are doing everything so that there will be no more gray zones in which Ukraine could find itself. We have become a candidate for joining the European Union and will do everything for integration in all possible directions. We are grateful to all European countries that have supported us on this path. We are grateful to Greece. We will create a system of security guarantees that will protect Ukraine while we are not in NATO. What is our principle? Russia considers the territory of our state as a bridgehead for seizing other European countries, and therefore providing security to Ukraine means providing long-term security to the whole of Europe. But this applies not only to our state. Now Europe is united as never before in many decades. Even 5 years ago, it was impossible to imagine that Europe would achieve such unity, and many discussions on platforms like yours were about how far the division of Europe would go. Division, not unity. Ukraine, I believe, corrected it. And we have to work on even greater unity. Europe is a subject. It is a global subject. It should be so. And this can only happen with Ukraine. Europe must become completely independent, particularly from Russia. From its ability to put pressure on you all or on each of you separately. Is it possible? I&#x27;m sure - yes, it&#x27;s possible. And when it becomes real, you will be able to say that what Europe is going through now will never happen again. The crisis of the cost of living or the threat of the migrant crisis, which will be a consequence of the food crisis, are all the consequences of those dependencies on Russia that still remained in Europe and the democratic world in general. You can look at it in different ways. You can mention various factors that influenced this. But if there wasn’t the one who makes all this worse, there would be no such acuteness of these crises, which makes them catastrophic. We can overcome all this. With unity. By strengthening collective security. With unconditional principles, without which nothing is possible - neither unity, nor security. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The maximum task for our state is to provide Ukrainians with basic protection against missile strikes already this year - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-05</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! On the night of July 5, an air alert was announced over almost the entire territory of our country. Before that, there has been no air alert in the capital and in some regions for some time, and some people even felt particularly anxious because of such unusual silence. They were overthinking, dreading, looking for some kind of explanation - as if the occupiers were preparing for something... Actually, you shouldn&#x27;t overthink. You should not look for logic in the actions of terrorists. The Russian army does not take any breaks. It has one task - to take people&#x27;s lives, to intimidate people - so that even a few days without an air alarm already feel like part of the terror. And this evening, Kyiv and again almost the whole of Ukraine heard the air alarm. As of now, there are reports of strikes at the Khmelnytskyi region - victims, wounded are now being specified. Our task is to hold on, to take care of ourselves, including our emotions, to help the country&#x27;s defense as much as possible, to protect the state, as much as it will be necessary for our victory. The occupiers again hit the Sumy region, Mykolaiv and the region, the Dnipropetrovsk region. Some of the missiles were shot down by our air defense forces. And we have not reduced and will not reduce our diplomatic activity for a single day to obtain modern anti-missile systems for Ukraine in sufficient quantity. This is a maximum task for our state – to provide basic security for Ukrainians, basic protection against missile attacks already this year. But the fulfillment of this task depends not only on us, but also on the understanding of our fundamental needs by our partners. I spoke today with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. I thanked him for increasing security assistance to our nation by £100 million more, on top of the £1 billion defense support package announced recently. This is a very tangible aid for us. We also discussed with Boris the system of security guarantees for Ukraine, which we are developing, which should work in the long term for our people. Together with the Presidents of Moldova and Greece I took part in the format of a special conference of The Economist. This is already the 26th such annual event, and this year Ukraine and security were, of course, the main words at it. Why do we need it? Our state needs certainty with a safe space right now. We are working very actively to ensure that all our partners both in Europe and on other continents understand our vision of security guarantees. Today, the results of two months of work of the United24 state charitable platform were summed up. Over this time, thanks to the participation of people from dozens of countries, we managed to collect more than two billion hryvnias for the needs of Ukraine. This is not only help to our defenders, but also contributions to demining and humanitarian needs. I personally thanked Liev Schreiber, a very famous actor, for joining United24 as an ambassador. He is a co-founder of the BlueCheck charitable organization, which financed programs for psychological support and evacuation of more than twenty thousand orphans from boarding schools and orphanages in the Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Odesa regions. Liev&#x27;s organization also helps families of IDPs in Lviv. Now he, together with Andriy Shevchenko and Elina Svitolina, will work in the humanitarian direction. And one more thing is very important. Today there were a lot of disputes in society regarding the decision of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to approve the Procedure for obtaining certain permits for those liable for military service, conscripts and reservists. I see that there are different assessments of such a decision, there is misunderstanding and even indignation in society. I instructed the Minister of Defense, the Chief of the General Staff, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to report all the details to me during tomorrow&#x27;s regular meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief as one of the items on the agenda. I promise the people to figure it out. And I ask the General Staff not to make such decisions without me in the future. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Artillery from our Western partners started working very powerfully, so the losses of the occupiers will only increase - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-06</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today in Kharkiv, the Pedagogical University was destroyed by a Russian missile strike - the main building, lecture halls, university museum, scientific library. This characterizes the Russian invasion with 100% accuracy. When it comes to the definition of barbarism, this strike fits the bill the most. Only an enemy of civilization and humanity can do such things - strike missiles at a university, a pedagogical university. Already the second object dedicated to Hryhoriy Skovoroda was damaged by this strike - a monument that was on the square in front of the university. It was covered with debris, but still the monument is not broken. And the Skovoroda museum located in the Kharkiv region burned down after Russian shelling back in May. However, paraphrasing the most famous words of Skovoroda, no matter how hard the occupiers try to catch us, they will fail. We will definitely endure. And we will restore everything. Finally it is felt that the Western artillery - the weapons we received from our partners - started working very powerfully. Its accuracy is exactly as needed. Our defenders inflict very noticeable strikes on depots and other spots that are important for the logistics of the occupiers. And this significantly reduces the offensive potential of the Russian army. The losses of the occupiers will only increase every week, as will the difficulty of supplying them. Today, the general public became aware that in the south of our country, in the occupied areas, access to social networks, messengers and YouTube was closed. Russian forces have blocked any possibility for people to know the truth about what is happening and about our potential, which we are gradually increasing. Ukrainian forces are currently advancing in several tactical directions, in particular in the south - in the Kherson region, in the Zaporizhzhia region. We will not give up our land - the entire sovereign territory of Ukraine will be Ukrainian. People should know it. Therefore, if you have an opportunity to speak with people in the south of our country - with Kherson, Henichesk, Berdyansk, Melitopol and other cities and villages - please spread the truth there. Use every opportunity to tell the people in the occupied areas that we remember them and we are fighting for them. We are fighting for our entire south, for the entire Ukrainian Donbas - the most brutal confrontation is currently there, near Slovyansk and Bakhmut. We are fighting for the Kharkiv region. The occupiers should not think that their time on this land is long-lasting and that the superiority of their artillery is eternal. I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Staff. As always, I listened to the reports both from the military and from intelligence. We jointly determined the directions of action for the near future. We are expanding our country&#x27;s foreign policy vectors. For the first time in the history of Ukrainian-Paraguayan relations, I had a conversation with the President of Paraguay - we appreciate the support from this country, and we will continue to strengthen ties in Latin America. I also spoke with the President of Mozambique today - I congratulated his country on the election to the UN Security Council, and I believe that Africa should get more representation on international platforms and in solving global issues. It is the African countries that are now most threatened by the food crisis provoked by Russia, and we must do everything to force the terrorist state to unblock Ukrainian agricultural exports. A visit to Kyiv by the Prime Minister of Ireland took place, a country that helps us significantly. Ireland even helped us convince representatives of skeptical states in the European Union that Ukraine deserves candidacy and future membership in the EU. We also remember that the Senate of Ireland recognized the crimes of the Russian occupiers as genocide of the Ukrainian people. This step, as well as Ireland&#x27;s support for legal efforts to punish Russian war criminals, is very important. The help of partners together with the work of Ukrainian law enforcement officers are the very bricks from which the restoration of justice for Ukraine will be built. Every Russian murderer, torturer and rapist who came to our land will be held accountable. And it doesn&#x27;t matter how long it takes to complete this task. There will be no peace for any of the occupiers. I am grateful to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The greater the defense aid to Ukraine is now, the sooner the war will end and the smaller the losses of all countries in the world will be - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-07</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the main topic in our country has become the British topic - Boris Johnson&#x27;s decision to resign as party leader and Prime Minister. In the afternoon I spoke with him and thanked for the support we have received since the first day of Russian terror. First of all, these are weapons: Stinger air defense systems, cool NLAW anti-tank systems, artillery, ammunition, armored vehicles and many, many other things. Substantial political support, strong sanctions against Russia, financial assistance to our state - more than two billion pounds have been allocated for security and defense needs alone since February 24. Britain&#x27;s role in protecting freedom is truly global. And although this is a reflection of the position of British society, the leadership and charisma of the state leader are always of special importance. Especially at such a time - the time of Russia&#x27;s full-scale anti-European war, which started its attack on Europe precisely from our state. So it is not surprising that Ukrainians feel personal gratitude to Boris. But let&#x27;s not forget that we are building relations between states. Great Britain&#x27;s support for Ukraine should not change, no matter what happens in London&#x27;s power circles, both Boris and all our friends in the United Kingdom assured me of this. I met today in Kyiv with representatives of the US Congress - Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal. They represent both parties, Republican and Democratic, and both support Ukraine very fundamentally. They were the authors of the resolution calling on the Department of State to recognize Russia as a state - sponsor of terrorism. I thanked them for this activity and hope that it will be brought to fruition. I informed the senators about the situation on the frontline, about what the occupiers are preparing for. In particular, we talked about Donbas, the south of our country, the Kharkiv region. Today, the Russian army hit Kramatorsk again - again with missiles. The occupiers also hit Kharkiv, the cities of Donbas... In each direction, our partners have accurate information about our defense needs. This concerns air defense, modern MLRS. The greater the defense aid to Ukraine is now, the sooner the war will end with our victory and the smaller will be the losses of all countries of the world, the losses of the United States from Russian pressure on democratic societies. Tomorrow I will continue the series of appeals to the European parliaments - it is Slovenia&#x27;s turn. Tomorrow there will also be a lot of internal Ukrainian news - a very meaningful day is ahead. After the conference in Lugano, which was dedicated to the recovery of Ukraine, government officials have already agreed on emergency aid to our country in the amount of more than $2 billion - these funds will be directed to strengthening the budget and preparing for winter. By the way, export of Ukrainian electricity to EU countries, which has already started, is a significant support both now and during the heating season. The price of electricity on the European market is higher than in Ukraine, and this will enable energy companies to use the earned funds to provide services for Ukrainian consumers. Moreover, with unchanged tariffs. Also, government officials are actively working on the logistics of agricultural exports. I heard the reports from the Minister of Infrastructure and the Minister of Agrarian Policy on this topic today. We will do everything to maintain access to the world market despite the Russian blockade of our ports. And, of course, today I want to express gratitude for the final stage of the struggle for Zmiinyi - our national flag was hoisted there. This operation lasted two months. Intelligence, Special Operations Forces, &quot;Alpha&quot; unit of the Security Service, border guards, gunners, Navy, Air Force. And now let every Russian captain - whether of a ship or an aircraft - see the Ukrainian flag on Zmiinyi and know that our state cannot be broken. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by the President to the Parliament of Slovenia</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-08</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mrs. President, Dear Mr. President, Dear Mr. Prime Minister, Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, People of Slovenia! It is an honor for me to address you in such a special format. And, by the way, now I am near the frontline, so my words in this address are strengthened by the emotions and hopes that our defenders shared with me. I am grateful to all the countries of the European Union in which such appeals of mine took place. We know that Russia tried to disrupt them, tried to use its various connections - political, diplomatic, even business. In Moscow they understand that they have nothing to oppose such trust between the people of Ukraine and Europe and such communication activity with. Therefore, they threatened Europeans, manipulated those who depend on them. But this is already the twenty-fourth parliament of the twenty-seven countries of the European Union, and I want to congratulate you on this obvious evidence that Russia has lost its influence in the European Union. The fact remains the following: most of the countries of the European Union cannot be ruled by Russia. And this is a new political reality in Europe, which we achieved together - every country that stood up for the defense of our common freedom. Everything we said about ourselves became our actions to protect ourselves and our democratic way of life. We don&#x27;t just enjoy freedom, we have made its defense a key goal of our anti-war coalition. We have not just achieved a new unity on the European continent, but are taking new and strong security, political and economic steps on its basis. And legal steps are next, namely: bringing Russian war criminals to justice. Most importantly, by going through this terrible challenge of the Russian war together, we prove that European values do not remain just a reference to old treaties and conventions, do not serve as formal criteria only at the level of rhetoric, but are the real basis of life on the continent here and now. And every country of the united Europe made its contribution to this. Not only those who occupy a large area on the map and who are used to attending the summits of the &quot;great&quot;. A free Europe is the result of the principles of all, and in particular those who do not have significant military or economic resources to resist Russian pressure, but who can fight thanks to their honesty and brave heart. Today I want to thank you, friends. I want to thank the entire Slovenian people, for your honesty and for your brave heart. A little more than two weeks ago, the European Council endorsed the decision to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. And this is one of those powerful political steps based on our new unity that strengthens us all on the continent. I am very grateful to you, Slovenia, for supporting us, supporting our candidacy. No one can say now how long our path from application to full membership will take, but we all know that the dream of a peaceful, free and stable Europe will not be realized without Ukraine as part of the European Union. And these are not just words, but another fact that will forever remain a fact. That is why Russia started a large-scale offensive on Europe from Ukraine, because Moscow is fully aware of the importance of Ukraine for the European project. And that is why Russia will inevitably lose, because Europe will not be split up, divided into pieces - as it was before. The eastern border of Europe is now equal to the eastern border of Ukraine, and one day, I believe soon, our eastern border will be marked: the territory of the European Union. In Moscow, they say that they are not enemies of Europe. The Russian leadership uses various propaganda theses to justify itself. But let&#x27;s look at their actions. Who are they hitting? Russia hit the Europeans with the gas crisis - and for the second year in a row, it is deliberately making efforts to ensure that European gas storage facilities remain unfilled before winter. Russia has driven gas prices in Europe to an all-time high – deliberately limiting supply in defiance of market rules. What did it lead to? Catastrophic inflation. If there were no such prices for energy resources, there would be no such painful consequences for the majority of people in Europe. Russia is also preparing another strike - migration. When the Russian fleet blocked our ports, it was a deliberate decision not just against Ukraine, but against everyone in the world who depends on food imports. And you can already see the consequences. But this is only the beginning, because without our food it will not be possible to stabilize the world market, save the countries of Africa and Asia from hunger. If there is a famine there, it means you will see new migrants on the territory of the EU. Millions of new migrants. I gave only a few examples from the wide palette of Russia&#x27;s anti-European actions. If the Russian leadership really sought to weaken someone other than Europe, as they claim, then Moscow would not hit the wallets of the residents of even those European countries that tried to be friendly to Russia to the last, and would not try to break the internal social stability of European countries. But thanks to cooperation with Ukraine, the European Union can protect itself, in particular, from such challenges. I will give you a few more examples. Our country joined the unified European energy system. We have a significant surplus in the production of electricity even now, when Russian marauders are dismantling and taking away solar power plants from the occupied regions of Ukraine, and have significantly limited our coal generation by their actions. We started exporting electricity to Romania and Slovakia - at a price that is significantly lower than the prices in the EU. We can quickly increase exports by ten or more times - and this will allow Ukrainian electricity to replace a significant part of European imports of Russian gas. Thanks to our electricity, all European neighbors of Ukraine can get a new energy stability, and therefore a decrease in energy prices in Europe. Let&#x27;s not forget about the Ukrainian gas storage facilities - the most convenient for our region, large in volume, and therefore able to strengthen the European gas market and make the European Union more prepared for winter seasons. It is the same with agricultural production. Even this year, during a full-scale war, the Ukrainian harvest of grain and oil crops will reach tens of millions of tons. For example, without Ukrainian corn, meat production in Europe and the world suffers - and therefore prices rise. Without our wheat and sunflower oil, there will be shortages in many countries - and therefore prices will rise. I emphasize once again: Russia deliberately blocked our exports in order to worsen the price crisis, to make it catastrophic, including for Europeans. But together with our partners in the European Union - at the level of Brussels and neighboring countries - we are creating new export routes. And the more such green corridors for Ukrainian food through the territory of the EU are created, the sooner we will guarantee protection for the south of Europe from new waves of migration, and therefore guarantee the preservation of internal social stability in the EU countries. Colossal opportunities also open up from the integration of our country into the digital market of the European Union - the business world is well aware of the potential of Ukrainian IT specialists. Industrial cooperation with us, as well as the joint implementation of the project of the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, can give the whole of Europe such an economic boost that will have historical weight and will be remembered in the same way as the implementation of the Marshall Plan after World War II. And I invite your country, as well as Slovenian companies and specialists, to join the reconstruction of Ukraine. The volume of work is already about a trillion dollars. And, of course, security. Can anyone now imagine Europe reliably protected from aggression without Ukrainian heroes? Russian tyranny wants to regain control over all the countries it could once reach. And in order for all the capitals from Ljubljana to Helsinki to feel safe, Ukraine must withstand, preserve one hundred percent of its sovereignty, recover from this war and become a long-term guarantor of Europe&#x27;s security against Russian revanchism. In order to get to you, they have to get through us, and therefore everyone in Europe is interested in Ukraine winning and being a part of common security formats with the Europeans. We are not going to delay. Ukraine realized its strength. You realized our strength. And this is our historical responsibility - of all leaders working in Europe today - to ensure maximum integration of Ukraine into the European Union. We must become a full member of the EU thanks to the fact that we share common values and for the full realization of the potential of our cooperation in many fields. Your writer, Rudi Kerševan, has some very apt words that perfectly describe the current situation: &quot;We enrich our lives not with things that have a price, but with things that have value.&quot; Starting from February 24, Europe focused precisely on what has value, and in a few months this gave progress that had not been seen in decades. Europe is united as never before. Europe has greater agency than ever. Europe has a future that will provide stability like never before. But all this is possible only together with Ukraine. And I believe that when the time comes for the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union, we will ensure that our relations reach another fundamental level - the level of a positive result in the negotiations regarding Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the EU. Thank you for your attention! Skupaj bomo zmagali! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Officials on the ground must do more than possible to guarantee people a normal standard of living in wartime conditions – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-08</span></div>
  <p>I wish good health to you, dear Ukrainians! Today, I worked all day in the field – in the city of Dnipro and in the region, in Kryvy Rih. I was on the front lines of our defense in Dnipropetrovsk region. I listened to the reports of the commanders, thanked our boys and girls, who are defending the region, on behalf of all Ukrainians. I awarded the Golden Star to the Hero of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Oleh Hrudzevych – commander of the tank battalion. Thanks to his personal bravery, his unit got out of the encirclement without casualties and destroyed the Russian sabotage group in a battle. A very strong person, you can feel it. I visited the famous Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro to personally thank our special heroes – all the doctors and nurses who have been rescuing our wounded soldiers and civilians every day since February 24 and since 2014. They are extremely successful on their front lines and gave second birthdays, saved the lives of thousands of our people. I presented state awards to our defenders who are recovering from injuries. I am really very grateful for all the kind words I heard today in Dnipro, that I heard on the front line. Thank you, first of all. Today, I addressed the Parliament of Slovenia. Every day and under any circumstances, we work as much as possible on the foreign policy front. And, by the way, this was already the twenty-fourth address to the parliaments of the EU countries and the first that was made near the front line. I hope that the three other EU countries will also feel that these appeals are not about politics, but about the protection of our common freedom, by the way, and therefore, we will come to the point that one day I will be able to say: all 27 parliaments of the European Union hear the struggle for freedom better than any Russian manipulations. I also held all the necessary meetings with the leaders of Dnipropetrovsk region in general and Kryvy Rih district in particular – both military and civilian. It was about security, economy, social issues. Officials must do not just everything possible, but much more than even possible, to guarantee people a normal standard of living even in such wartime conditions. I am returning to the capital of Ukraine. Of course, I want to say two more things. I congratulated Chief Commissar Zaluzhny on his birthday today. I wished him good health, I wished him and all of us the most important thing – victory. Thank you for your service! And tomorrow, on July 9, and in fact already after sunset today, the Muslim community begins to celebrate Kurban Bayram. This is a special holiday that teaches sacrifice and guides people to do good deeds. I want to congratulate now all Muslims of Ukraine and the world and wish that the rule of peace is restored, and all kinds of evil always lose the sooner the better. The Crimean Tatar people especially expect this, and I believe that the year will come when we will welcome each other in a free Crimea. Kurban Bayramınız Hayırlı ve mübarek olsun! Congratulations on the blessed holiday - Kurban Bayram! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia&#x27;s terrorist actions can be stopped only with modern, high-precision, potent weapons – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-09</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you all health! A brief report on the events of the day – it&#x27;s already the 136th day of our defense. Today, I held a meeting with President of the French Senate Gerard Larcher and a delegation of senators after Mr. Larcher delivered his speech in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. And I am grateful to him for his inspired and neat address. The address, in which he reminded, in particular, that the front line holds as long as the rear holds, and our rear is now not only the free part of Ukraine, but also all 27 countries of the European Union, the entire democratic world. Therefore, our entire team, the Ukrainian team, works 24/7 to keep the interests of our state and our defense in the focus of every country that is already or may become part of our anti-war coalition. Mr. Larcher also said another important thing: with every attack on Ukraine, with every crime of the Russian occupiers, with every new martyr city, the resoluteness of Europeans to help Ukraine becomes more stable. It really is. However, the terrorist state does not understand this at all and will never accept it as a fact. Only in one day, the Russian army attacked the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv, Kryvy Rih, the communities of Zaporizhzhia region... It fired precisely at the residential sector – absolutely deliberately, purposefully, at ordinary houses and civilian objects. There are casualties – dead, wounded. The brutal strikes of the Russian artillery in Donbas do not stop for a single day – the Sloviansk direction, Bakhmut, Avdiyivka... You can really stop such terrorist actions only with modern, high-precision and potent weapons. And I want to thank the United States of America for the decision to provide Ukraine with a new defense aid package in the amount of $400 million. Additional HIMARS launchers units and other high-precision weapons allow us to take precisely anti-terrorist steps and reduce Russian attack capabilities. I held a meeting today with representatives of construction companies – with those on whom the quality of Ukrainian infrastructure – our supply routes – depends. The question of building a high-quality transport network is always also a question of safety. And in the conditions of the full-scale war, strong infrastructure is one of the key elements of defense. I thanked the representatives of the construction companies for their work, discussed with them the key tasks for the near future – it concerns both the reconstruction of our country and the additional strengthening of our logistics. Today, I signed decrees on the dismissal of some ambassadors of Ukraine. This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice. New representatives of Ukraine will be appointed to the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Norway and India. Candidates are being prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I am already preparing for the new week – there will be important news, including from government officials. Thank you to everyone who defends the state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The retreat of the occupiers from Ukrainian land is inevitable, as is their punishment, but we must fight together for this - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-10</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! I have been receiving reports all day long today from the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. A rescue operation is underway there after a Russian strike at residential buildings. Two high-rise buildings were destroyed. Dozens of people are under the rubble. Six were saved. There are 15 names in the list of the dead and, unfortunately, this is not the final number. It was a missile strike. And everyone who gives orders for such strikes, everyone who carries them out targeting our ordinary cities, residential areas, kills absolutely deliberately. After such strikes, the killers will not be able to say they did not know something or did not understand something... All those who carried out this shelling, other missile strikes, all those who hit our cities with rocket artillery, as is the case with the Kharkiv region, Zaporizhzhia, Kryvyi Rih, Siversk and Vuhledar in the Donetsk region - they will all be found. You know, Nazi murderers are found and brought to justice even when they are 90 or 100 years old. They are caught all over the world. Of course, we don&#x27;t want to wait that long. But I give this example to show that punishment is inevitable for every Russian murderer. Absolutely everyone. Just as for the Nazis. And they should not expect that their state will protect them. Russia will be the first to abandon them when political circumstances change. Since the beginning of this invasion, Ukrainian law enforcement officers have been doing everything necessary to record the crimes of the occupiers and to collect evidence. Our partners from many countries are involved in this work. Russian terror has long crossed the line beyond which it became obvious to many in the civilized world that it is a matter of global security to punish Russia, a terrorist state, for everything it has done against Ukraine and the international legal order. My schedule for the coming weeks includes precisely such negotiations and appeals that will contribute to the restoration of justice, to the punishment of Russian war criminals. Moreover, this activity is aimed not only at Europe and other traditional regions for the work of Ukrainian diplomacy. We will do everything so that Latin America, Asia and Africa hear the truth about Russian terror on our land as well. In the past week, many talked about the alleged &quot;operational pause&quot; in the actions of the occupiers in Donbas and other parts of Ukraine. 34 airstrikes by Russian aircraft over the past day is an answer to all those who came up with this &quot;pause&quot;. The Ukrainian army is holding on firmly, repelling attacks in various directions. But, of course, a lot still needs to be done so that Russian losses really cause such pause. Moreover, the pause not before new offensives of the occupiers, but before their retreat from our Ukrainian land. And I am grateful to all our fighters who are bringing this time closer. It is inevitable, as is the punishment for the occupiers. But we have to hold on, we have to fight together on all fronts now - on the political, information and economic fronts, without showing weakness anywhere. We can withstand this war only together - absolutely everyone, every Ukrainian man, every Ukrainian woman. Glory to all who protect our native state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The decision on the exception to sanctions will be perceived in Russia exclusively as a manifestation of weakness - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-11</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today was a difficult day. First, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to summon Canada&#x27;s representative to our country due to an absolutely unacceptable exception to the sanctions regime against Russia. It&#x27;s not just about some Nord Stream turbine that Canada shouldn&#x27;t have, but still decided to hand over. Hand over actually to Russia. This is about common rules. If a terrorist state can squeeze out such an exception to sanctions, what exceptions will it want tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? This question is very dangerous. Moreover, it is dangerous not only for Ukraine, but also for all countries of the democratic world. The decision on the exception to sanctions will be perceived in Moscow exclusively as a manifestation of weakness. This is their logic. And now, there can be no doubt that Russia will try not just to limit as much as possible, but to completely shut down the supply of gas to Europe at the most acute moment. This is what we need to prepare for now, this is what is being provoked now. Because every concession in such conditions is perceived by the Russian leadership as an incentive for further, stronger pressure. Of course, this decision on one turbine, which leads to many other problems, can still be revised. Russia has never played by the rules in the energy sector and it will not play now unless it sees strength. Debris clearance continues all day in the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. The day before yesterday, Russian terrorists hit two high-rise buildings, and as of now 31 people are known to be killed. Nine were saved. Kharkiv faced new brutal attacks by the Russian army. Another rocket hit a residential building - one block was completely destroyed. In the morning, the occupiers shelled the Saltivka and Kyiv districts with rocket artillery – five people were killed. The Odesa region was hit by missiles, extremely violent hostilities continued in the Donetsk region and on the territory of the Luhansk region. My condolences to all relatives and friends of the deceased… And against such a background, it&#x27;s just a shame to see people lacking the courage to honestly deal with one turbine. Today I submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a very important draft law - on legal and social guarantees for Polish citizens residing in Ukraine. In fact, this is a response to the law that was adopted by the Polish state in the spring in the interests of our citizens. In particular, I propose to give our Polish brothers the opportunity to legally stay in Ukraine for 18 months, the right to employment, economic activity, study at our universities, medical care. I ask the people&#x27;s deputies of Ukraine to consider this draft law as conscientiously as possible. In relations with Poland, we have reached the highest level of trust and cooperation not just in decades, but in the lifetime of many generations of our nations. And we must increase it, we must further strengthen our ties in all spheres and on the basis of a clear understanding that Ukraine and Poland can be free only together - in brotherhood. Today, I also signed a decree conferring the honorary title of the Rescuer City upon the city of Przemyśl. For the extremely significant contribution of the city authorities, volunteers and residents to help our people and our defense. Let me remind you that this is the second such decision – the Polish city of Rzeszów was the first to receive this title. I held important negotiations with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte in Kyiv. We discussed our defense cooperation, financial assistance for Ukraine and the further progress of our country on the European path. I am thankful for the strong support, which is currently the largest in the entire history of Ukrainian-Dutch relations. I had a conversation with President of Turkey Erdoğan. The key issue is the restoration of our export routes through the Black Sea. We are working on making it possible. The sooner this happens, the fewer people in the world will feel the impact of the food crisis that was so carefully prepared by Russia. In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our heroes. 287 combatants received state awards. I am grateful to everyone who defends the people and the state! I am grateful to everyone who works for the victory! I believe that thanks to you, the sun will rise in Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Now Ukraine not only implements NATO standards, but also can participate in the development of new standards - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-12</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I would like to highlight one decision that looks like a technical one, but there is a lot of symbolism and meaningful political work behind it. Ukraine became an associate member of NATO&#x27;s special multilateral program on technological interoperability. To put it more simply, it is about Alliance’s standards. Now Ukraine not only implements NATO standards, but also can participate in the development of new standards. The experience of our military, the capabilities of Ukrainian institutions, the IT potential of our country - all this will now be the Ukrainian contribution to the development of collective security in Europe. And when does it happen? On the 139th day of a full-scale war, with which Russia planned to destroy us in a week. And the Ukrainian state not only survived, not only defends itself, but also develops and will help the development of its partners. Such success is worth noting. Every day we receive and experience a lot of painful news. The war continues, Russian shelling does not stop for a single day. Today there were regular strikes at Mykolaiv - missiles, artillery. The occupiers once again hit Kharkiv and the communities of the region - Staryi Saltiv, Zolochiv, Bayrak and others. There are victims - wounded and killed. In Donbas, offensive attempts do not stop, the situation there does not get easier, and the losses do not get smaller. We must remember this. We must see this, draw attention to this. And it should also be remembered that even in such conditions, the state takes steps forward - in cooperation with partners - in institutional development. And, of course, on the frontline. The occupiers have already felt very well what modern artillery is, and they will not have a safe rear anywhere on our land, which they occupied. They have felt that the operations of our reconnaissance officers to protect their Homeland are much more powerful than any of their &quot;special operations&quot;. Russian soldiers - and we know this from interceptions of their conversations - are truly afraid of our Armed Forces. 139 days of such a war, almost 20 weeks... The so-called second army of the world is afraid of Ukrainians and is able to do something only on the basis of bottomless stocks of old Soviet weapons. They no longer have strategic strength, character, or understanding of what they are doing here on our land. They also don’t have even an iota of courage to admit defeat and withdraw troops from Ukrainian territory. Today in Kyiv, I held talks with Mariusz Błaszczak, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of Poland. And he brought us &quot;Krabs&quot; - those that will powerfully feed our enemy with fire. Of course, the key topic of our negotiations was further defense cooperation. But it is important not only what we talked about, but also how we talked. With absolute confidence in the Ukrainian future. In the Ukrainian European future. The same goes for all my other negotiations. It is always felt. A really difficult road is ahead. Unfortunately, it is impossible to do otherwise when you are protecting your home from a terrorist assault. But it is also clear that what lies ahead is the success of our state. Ukraine will be able to defend itself. Ukraine will be able to rebuild itself. Ukraine will be able to fulfill all its foreign policy goals. When millions of people work sincerely for this - each and every one at their own level - the result will be inevitable. And you know, for some reason I rarely thanked ordinary people who work in Ukraine. Who stay here no matter what. Who do their job every day. With faith in Ukraine, with faith in victory. Now I want to thank you all. Thank you for having you. Thank you for being with Ukraine. In the evening, as always, I signed the decree awarding our heroes. 156 warriors were awarded state awards. 56 of them - posthumously. Eternal glory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all those who fight for the future of our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russian tactics must not become the norm, the world order must be restored - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the &quot;Asian Leadership&quot; conference in Seoul</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-13</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President! Ladies and Gentlemen! Almost three months ago, on April 11, I addressed the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people. I spoke then about our independence - this is the main thing that Russia wants to take away from us. It was to deprive us of our independence that Russia started this brutal war of destruction. Ukraine became the first target. And I talked about the fact that Russia plans to go further to other countries in Europe and Asia. This is its strategy. But what is its tactic? The hundred days that have passed since my address to your parliament have fully revealed Russia&#x27;s tactics. Every detail of it. This is terror. And if it remains unpunished, you will see it repeated in other parts of the world, in other countries. Because tactic is something that is very easy to learn when you see it working. And various tyrannies are now looking to see if Russian tactic will work. The first tactical point - artillery takes our cities hostage. The Russian army organizes its offensive so that its howitzers and MLRS can hit ordinary residential areas of ordinary cities. For example, this was exactly the goal of the invaders in the spring, when Russian soldiers moved from the northern border of our state to our capital, in order to have the opportunity to either destroy Kyiv with artillery, or blackmail us with such destruction. The Ukrainian army has ousted the Russians from the northern territories, but the occupiers remain in the east and south of our country and build their offensive in the same way - so that ordinary houses are within the range of their howitzers and MLRS. The second point is missile terror. 2,960 missiles as of this morning - that&#x27;s how much Russia managed to launch at our cities. And the main targets of missiles are civilian objects. Imagine an ordinary shopping mall or school somewhere in Incheon or Gwangju. How would you react to a large anti-ship missile hitting such targets? Which was developed to destroy aircraft carriers. And hundreds of similar strikes? Of course, this is a tactic. Russia&#x27;s tactic, which is aimed at expelling people from our cities and making every Ukrainian fear the terrorist state. The third point is deportation. Just imagine this number - two million people. So many of our people have already been taken to Russia. Several hundred thousand children. No one will tell the exact numbers at the moment - all these deported people are deprived of means of communication, their documents are taken away from them, they are intimidated and taken to remote areas of Russia to make it as difficult as possible for them to return to their homeland. How will we then take our people back from all those places where people were forcibly deported? Moreover, Russia forcibly created so-called filtration camps, through which it forces people to pass in the occupied territory. Tens of thousands of people remain there. Young women disappear there. I think you all understand what is happening with them there. The fourth point of Russian tactic is an economic shock. And this concerns not only us. Look at just one example - the events in Sri Lanka. The shocking rise in food and fuel prices caused a social explosion. No one knows now how it will end. However, you all know that the same outbursts are possible in other countries affected by food and energy crises. And what led to the aggravation of these crises? Russia&#x27;s cynical blockade of our seaports, which does not allow the critically important supply of Ukrainian food to the world market. And also a completely thought-out Russian game to raise energy prices. And the fifth point of Russian tactic is propaganda. Probably, no other state in the world has spent so much money on the deliberate dissemination of disinformation, anti-scientific conspiracy theories, in particular regarding vaccines, as Russia does. Is Asia free from such Russian lies? Unfortunately no. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is now 2022. No city in the world should be held hostage by artillery. Every nation terrorized by missiles should receive adequate assistance and protection from other free nations. Any attempts at deportation in today&#x27;s world must receive the toughest response from the international community. Any state that blocks ports and makes the sea deadly dangerous must pay such a price for its behavior through sanctions, which will demonstrate to all potential aggressors of the world that repeating such Russian tactics is extremely unprofitable. And, finally, all the countries of the world must protect themselves from those who try to spread their influence through the &quot;means of mass lies.&quot; Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine is actually a global issue. The issue of not only the future of our nation, but also the future of dozens of other nations. Will democracy withstand the attacks of tyranny? Will humanity find effective means of responding to the deliberate terror of a larger state against a smaller state? Will such global mechanisms finally be created to protect every nation from hunger? Will we all have enough leadership to resist evil, whatever it may be, be it armed aggression or pandemic? Russian tactics must not become the global norm, and the world order must be restored. When Ukraine turns to partners for weapons for its defense and for strengthening sanctions against a terrorist state, it is not only about our defense. It&#x27;s like vaccines: if you don&#x27;t help other nations, you have to be prepared for new strains of the virus that will make your own defense ineffective. And I am sincerely grateful to the Republic of Korea, which realizes that this is the situation, that we should act together. And I believe that the effectiveness of joint efforts can be such that in another hundred days I can address the people of Korea again and thank them for the fact that the aggressor has really been punished, and all other potential aggressors in the world have no alternative to a normal peaceful life. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>If we manage to remove the Russian threat to navigation in the Black Sea, it will remove the severity of the world food crisis - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-13</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I signed a decree awarding the Order of Merit of the 1st degree to Maryna Viazovska, a Ukrainian mathematician who became a laureate of the Fields Medal this year. This is a very important and prestigious award - it is called the Nobel Prize in Mathematics. Ukrainian Mrs. Viazovska became the second woman in the entire history of the award since 1936 to win this medal. She managed to solve the problem of packing spheres in eight-dimensional space. As scientists note, Maryna Viazovska offered very powerful ideas and helped solve related problems. Today I want to thank Mrs. Maryna. Not only for her work, for a very powerful mathematical result, but also for the fact that she helps all of us, all Ukrainians, protect our freedom and independence. In particular, during the ceremony of awarding the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians, in her speech Mrs. Maryna spoke about Ukraine, about Russia&#x27;s war against our country, about the crimes of the Russian occupiers. Mrs. Maryna studied in Ukraine, in Kyiv, she works in Switzerland, in Lausanne, heads the department of number theory. And I believe that the day will come when Maryna Viazovska will be able to return to Ukraine and teach here. I took part in the work of the &quot;Asian Leadership&quot; conference, which takes place every year in Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea. This is one of those platforms that attracts the attention of the entire region. And it is important for Ukraine that our interests and values are heard and perceived in all parts of the world, especially in the leading countries of Asia. I thanked them for their support and called for more active opposition to Russian terror tactics. And what an evil irony: today the representatives of the occupation structures in Donetsk announced that they were, as they say, recognized by the DPRK. Of course, we will react in a very tough manner at all levels. But this is the news that does not even need additional comments. Everything is obvious. The path we are taking and the path the occupiers can lead to. Debris clearance continues after the Russian attack on the city of Chasiv Yar. As of this time, the list of the dead includes 48 people, including one child. Unfortunately, the number of those rescued has not changed - 9 people. Rescuers will work on site until all debris is cleared. It was one of the most brutal Russian strikes during the entire war - so many victims... My condolences to the relatives and friends of the victims. I am preparing to address the participants of the forum in The Hague in the Netherlands, which will be held tomorrow and dedicated to the prosecution of Russian war criminals. World democracies are willing to do everything necessary to make every Russian terrorist responsible for evil against Ukrainians. And we must coordinate our efforts in such a way that all the guilty receive fair sentences. There will be a tribunal. Today in the news there are many references to the meeting in Turkey regarding the unblocking of agricultural exports from our country through the Black Sea. We are indeed making significant efforts to restore the supply of food to the world market. And I am grateful to the United Nations and Turkey for their respective efforts. The success of this story is needed not only by our state, but also, without exaggeration, by the whole world. If we manage to remove the Russian threat to navigation in the Black Sea, it will remove the severity of the world food crisis. The Ukrainian delegation informed me that there is some progress. We will agree on the details with the UN Secretary General in the coming days. In the evening, as usual, I signed the decree awarding our warriors. 136 combatants were awarded state awards, 25 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to everyone who protects our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>All Russian criminals must face a mandatory and principled punishment - President&#x27;s speech at the International Conference in The Hague on holding Russia accountable for crimes in Ukraine </h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-14</span></div>
  <p>Dear conference participants, Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and take part in a conference whose purpose, frankly speaking, is to save international law. Because right now it depends precisely on our joint efforts whether humanity will have such a tool as international law at all. Whether humanity will live in chaos and constant violence from those who believe that force allegedly decides everything and that aggression allegedly allows any wishes of tyrants to be served under the guise of law. In a few days, on July 17, it will already be 8 years since one of the most terrible air disasters in history - shooting down of MH17 flight. Then, Russian criminals killed 298 people in the sky over the Ukrainian Donbas. The world, seeing that crime, realized what is happening in Ukraine. Realized what aggression Russia came with to our country. The shooting down of MH17 attracted global attention. All the world&#x27;s media, politicians and societies felt the pain of the families who lost their loved ones in that disaster. 80 children died, among them three babies... It is impossible to forget the photos of children&#x27;s toys found on the ground among the wreckage of the Boeing. Time passes by, that tragedy is talked about less and less. But justice does its job. Ukraine, the Netherlands, all our partners, experts and investigators managed to establish a complete picture of what happened to MH17. And I have no doubt that everyone who committed that terrible crime will receive a fair punishment. However, we must remember why that crime became possible. We must remember that it is neither the only one nor random. That catastrophe became just one of many catastrophes and tragedies caused by the primary Russian crime – armed aggression against Ukraine. It all started in 2014. And it continues to this day. Taking the lives of our people every day. This morning, Russian missiles hit our city of Vinnytsia. An ordinary peaceful city. Cruise missiles hit two public buildings. Residential buildings were destroyed, the medical center was on fire. Cars and trams were on fire. This is an audacious act of Russian terror. People couldn&#x27;t do that. They are beasts! Eight missiles, two of which hit downtown. As of this moment, 20 people died, among them three children, a large number of wounded... I ask you now to honor with a moment of silence the memory of all those killed by Russian crimes - from 2014 to this day, all those who were killed by Russia on our Ukrainian land and in the Ukrainian sky. Thank you. I am grateful to you for honoring the memory of the victims of Russian aggression with me. Just feel it: we do it every day. Because every day, every day, our people die, children die. Due to Russian aggression, tens of thousands of Ukrainians were killed, tortured and maimed. Millions were deported to Russia or made homeless by hostilities. It is still being established how many children Russian forces abducted and took out of Ukraine... The preliminary figure is dreadful - about two hundred thousand children. The world saw what happened in Mariupol and Bucha. The world sees Russian missile terror. Literally live, everyone can see Russian artillery burning down cities in Donbas and destroying civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv and in the south of our country. Only since the start of the full-scale invasion on February 24, the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine have registered 34 thousand 39 crimes related to Russian aggression. This is slightly less than in 5 months. And imagine how many crimes the Russian occupiers have committed since 2014... And for this primary, initial crime of armed aggression, there must be mandatory and principled punishment for all Russian criminals. Ukrainian justice will do the part of the work that the national jurisdiction allows. I believe that the International Criminal Court will inevitably ensure the liability of those guilty of crimes under its jurisdiction: war crimes, crimes against humanity, the crime of genocide. And I am grateful to all our partners who support us along the way. By the way, to help the investigation - both Ukrainian and international - we launched the &quot;Book of Torturers of the Ukrainian People&quot; project. This project allows you to collect evidence of war crimes and data about those who committed them on an online platform. In today&#x27;s world, this and similar digital and communication tools significantly accelerate the work of the investigation. But the existing judicial institutions for jurisdictional reasons cannot bring to justice all those guilty of the primary crime of aggression. That is why we need a Special Tribunal regarding this crime - Russian aggression against Ukraine. A Tribunal that will ensure the fair and lawful punishment of those who started this history of disasters and tragedies, which has become the biggest war in Europe since World War II. Our efforts will be enough to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers; to gather all the evidence so that it is absolutely admissible in the courts; to establish each of the guilty. However, those people whose decisions led to this array of crimes must not hide behind the so-called immunity of officials. The principle of inevitability of punishment must also apply to these people. And this can only be ensured by the Special Tribunal on Aggression against Ukraine. And in addition to such a Tribunal, an instrument for compensation for all damages caused by aggression is also needed. Time is merciless and plays into the hands of Russia. People can&#x27;t wait long for justice. If justice is delayed, people feel as if there is no justice. Today, the world no longer recalls the terrible Russian crimes that were committed at the beginning of the aggression against our state - back in 2014 and 2015. Now the feelings in the world about Mariupol, about &quot;Azovstal&quot;, about Bucha are completely different - much less intense. Of course, people have not changed their assessment of these and other crimes. However, to ensure a feeling that justice is being restored, it is necessary not only to punish the guilty. It is necessary to give the victims of crimes full assistance and to rebuild everything destroyed by this aggression. The aggressor must lose both on the battlefield and at the level of meanings, so that the war becomes a heavy loss, first of all, for the aggressor, not for the victims. Please pay attention - the same group of people is behind all the thousands of crimes committed during Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine. Those who give criminal orders. Those who always tell the same lies. Those who have been thinking for nine years already how to make it worse and more painful for everyone around them, how to cause more losses to other states and nations. The life and wealth of this group of people is ensured by other individuals and legal entities. By the assets registered on them. By the property they own openly or secretly. By the money they hid in different jurisdictions and in different forms - private, state or quasi-state. Therefore, Ukraine proposed to create a special compensation mechanism. We believe that compensation for the damage caused by Russian aggression can be ensured at the expense of Russian assets and funds located outside the borders of Russia - in other jurisdictions. And we must understand that the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine is an extremely complex project that can become successful with the help of partners. And the sooner the compensation mechanism starts working, the more effectively the assets of the terrorist state will be converted into compensation, and the less financial burden our partners will bear. And now I would like to thank Canada and other countries that are working to make their legislation allow for this kind of reimbursement process. We have to make it global - so that no one in the world will think again that aggression against a sovereign state contrary to international law can be tolerable for the aggressor. We need just such a global legal path, which will reflect one of our common values - the rule of law. Ladies and Gentlemen! Justice must always do its job. And our task, the task of all politicians, is to give justice the necessary tools. The power of the law, its supremacy is ensured only when there are effective and stable institutions capable of implementing the law in any conditions. We know what institutions we need. We can create them. And they will definitely work. And this will be a contribution to the protection of the world order, the world legal order, that can be compared only to the Nuremberg trials. This is our joint task. I thank you for your help! I thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This day once again proved that Russia must be recognized as a terrorist state - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-14</span></div>
  <p>Today I am addressing not Ukrainian men and women, as usual, but our partners. Democratic world. This day once again proved that Russia must be officially recognized as a terrorist state. No other state in the world poses such a terrorist threat as Russia. No other state in the world allows itself to destroy peaceful cities and ordinary human life with cruise missiles and rocket artillery every day. As a result of just one missile attack on our city of Vinnytsia, 23 people were killed. Three children under the age of ten. And this, unfortunately, is not yet the final number. Debris clearance is ongoing. Dozens of people are listed as missing. Heavily wounded are among those hospitalized. One of the missiles destroyed the Neuromed medical center. There were people inside. Nataliya, she is 40 years old. Tetiana, she is 32 years old. Volodymyr, he is 61 years old. Vira, she is 55 years old. I saw them among the missing. You see, it was not even known what happened to the people who simply went to the medical center... And if someone launched a missile attack on a medical center in Dallas or Dresden, God forbid, what would it be called? Wouldn’t it be called terrorism? A girl is among the dead today in Vinnytsia, she was four years old, her name was Liza. The child was four years old! Her mother is in critical condition... Russia ended the girl&#x27;s life just at the time when a conference on Russian war crimes was taking place in the Netherlands, in The Hague. A conference where it was decided what should be done to ensure that every Russian military is punished. Can you think of any other terrorist organization that would allow itself such audacity? To kill just at the moment when its previous crimes are the subject of international discussion. Russia has thus shown its attitude to international law, to Europe, and to the entire civilized world. After that, no one can have any doubt that a Special Tribunal on Russian aggression against Ukraine is needed as soon as possible. Also, a special compensation mechanism must be implemented as soon as possible, with the help of which all Russian assets and funds in all countries of the world must be confiscated and aimed at compensations for the victims of Russian terror. It is absolutely necessary to implement as soon as possible such restrictions against Russian energy exports, which will not allow terrorists to cover their costs at the expense of the international community. And I want to emphasize: all this is needed not only by Ukraine, not only by our citizens, whose lives are under threat of Russian terror. This is needed by all of you, everyone in the world who values human life at least a little. Terror is a virus. And if one of the terrorists goes unpunished, it only encourages others. The ceremony of awarding our defenders upon whom the title of Hero of Ukraine was conferred took place this morning in Kyiv. I presented the Gold Star Orders to our warriors, as well as to the relatives of those warriors who were awarded the title of Hero posthumously. In total, during the full-scale war since February 24, the title of Hero has been awarded to 157 Ukrainians, 75 - posthumously. More than 23,000 of our defenders have been awarded state awards, more than 3,500 - posthumously. Hundreds of thousands of our warriors hold back the Russian onslaught every day and every night. Ukrainians make one of the most significant contributions in history to the the fight against terrorism. And we are grateful to everyone who helps us. To every state, international structures, public associations around the world, conscientious business, every person who cares. But the time has come for the democratic world to enshrine all this in proper legal instruments. The status of a terrorist state for Russia. The special tribunal on Russian aggression. The special compensation mechanism that will direct the funds of the terrorist state to those whom it wanted to destroy. And, of course, new sanctions for terror. New sanctions are needed as soon as possible. And finally. I want the crew of the vessel, which fired the Kalibrs on Vinnytsia today, to know for sure that prison is the best thing they may face. Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror! Eternal glory to each and every one who defends a normal peaceful life! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will come to the day when Russian terror will become impossible, but for this we still need to fight – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-15</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Ukrainian men and women! Today, the European Union announced the first details of the new, seventh sanctions package being prepared against the Russian Federation, and the task of Ukrainian diplomats is to do everything to strengthen this package. After an attack on Vinnytsia and other terrorist attacks by the Russian army, the occupiers must feel what a fair response to terror means. In particular, it will be felt thanks to sanctions. Of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will certainly provide their part of the answer. The occupiers will have no restful nights. The identification of all those guilty in the attack on the city of Vinnytsia has already begun. Both at the national level and at the international level, we will do everything to make absolutely all Russian murderers responsible for what they have done. The Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine reported to me today full information about the rescue operation that was run in the city. In total, almost two hundred people applied for medical help. Four people are currently in critical condition, unfortunately. Four citizens are still missing in the list. Everything is being done on the ground to clarify their fate. The death toll has not changed at this time – 23 people. The minister also briefed me on the attack of the Russian army on the city of Mykolaiv this morning. The buildings of two institutes – pedagogical and shipbuilding – have been destroyed. There are no such words in normal human language that can describe the state to which the Russian state has degraded. It is a double crime – to destroy particularly pedagogical institutes, so that there is no educational institution, and new educators cannot be trained... But let the terrorists not hope that this will give them something. We will definitely restore everything they destroyed. Each of the more than two thousand educational institutions – all kindergartens, all schools, institutes, universities. And most importantly, we will preserve our humanity and our civility. But Russian society with so many murderers and executioners will remain crippled for generations, and through its own fault. The United States of America is preparing a defense budget for the new fiscal year - with supplemental assistance to Ukraine. In particular, it is about expanding the capabilities of our military aviation. This and other US assistance to our country will significantly strengthen our defense potential. It is important. I want to once again express my gratitude to the American people, President Biden, the US Congress for all the support we receive. By the way, only in the last two weeks, $3 billion were transferred to the Ukrainian budget from the United States of America, and this enables us to ensure the current social needs of Ukrainians today. America is truly a leader in the global defense of freedom. Right now, as I am writing this address, the air alert is over almost the entire territory of our state. There is preliminary information about strikes - Dnipro, Kremenchuk, Kyiv region. The occupiers realize that we are gradually becoming stronger, and the goal of their terror is very simple – to put pressure on you and me, on our society, to intimidate people, to cause as much as possible damage to Ukrainian cities, while Russian terrorists are still able to do it. So I&#x27;m begging you, once again: please don&#x27;t ignore the air alert signals now. Appropriate rules of conduct must be followed at all times, especially at public objects. Of course, we will come to the day when Russian terror will become impossible. But it still needs time. We still have to fight. And we will fight. Today, I signed a new decree on awarding our soldiers. A total of 242 combatants were honored by state awards. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for you and me, for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to all who defend our state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia&#x27;s missiles, artillery not to be able to break our unity, to throw us off our path – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-16</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Ukrainian men and women! On this day, 32 years ago, the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine was endorsed. It was the first document of this kind after many years, which confirmed the right of our people to live independently. Independently and in a democratic way. The specific points of the Declaration reflected the realities of that time and the hopes that prevailed in our society. 32 years later, after eight years of war in Donbas and on the 143rd day of the full-scale war against Russia, it may seem that the text of the Declaration could be different, particularly from a security point of view. But at that time this text was also of a revolutionary character. The Declaration restored the tradition of Ukrainian state-establishing, and it was on its basis that the Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine was later adopted. And today, when our people are fighting for independence, we have our right in every sense of the word – historically, politically, culturally and, what is very important – legally. In particular, our people&#x27;s confidence in victory is based on this. Ukraine has withstood Russia&#x27;s brutal blows. We have already managed to liberate part of the territory that was occupied after February 24. We will gradually liberate other regions of our state that are currently under the occupation. During such a war, we were able to obtain the status of the EU candidate. We have maintained the stability of public institutions. The power system was rebuilt to work in the power grid of the European continent. All logistical processes in the state – military and economic – were rechanneled. And most importantly, we maintain internal unity, having overcome conflicts and contradictions that had hindered us in the past. We must all remember the cost of mistakes and discord that made it difficult for previous generations to achieve the results we have today. We must remember how much our people had to go through until it became possible to restore Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and independence. But our time has added one more thing to everything that path strewn teaches. It&#x27;s very important. This did not happen before. Never in the past, as much as now, it did not depend on the ability of Ukrainians to be very careful and circumspect in the information field. Even today showed how important it is that we take care of Ukraine and each other in what we say and how we experience this time. How many people were scared today by a fake about a massive Russian missile attack on Ukraine? After everything that happened in the previous weeks. After the Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Chasiv Yar... How many headaches are given every day by the production of horror stories from Russian propagandists and officials... How many problems Ukrainians create for themselves by trusting any anonymous source... This sometimes takes on simply unhealthy forms when social networks and websites deliberately stuff fake information from Russia, the purpose of which is only one – to add media terror to the missile and artillery terror against our country. Therefore, we also need a kind of emotional sovereignty so that we do not depend on what the enemy constantly launches against you and me. In order not to play along with the media game against Ukraine. To have the power to consciously perceive any information, any messages, no matter who they come from. And to see who needs them and for what, and whether Ukraine needs them in particular, whether they make the path to victory easier for you and me. Sometimes media weapons can do more than conventional weapons. It is obvious that any missiles and artillery of Russia will not succeed in breaking our unity and knocking us off our path. And it should be equally obvious that Ukrainian unity cannot be broken by lies or intimidation, fake information or conspiracy theories. We will stand. We will win. We will win back our, rebuild our lives. We will do it together – that&#x27;s the only way it can be done. This can be done only without mutual competition. This is our obligation to all generations of our people who fought for our freedom and sovereignty of Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who is fighting for the state of Ukraine, who is working for victory and who is defending our people. Let&#x27;s hold on. Only together! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Actions and inaction of every official in the security sector and in the law enforcement agencies will be evaluated - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-17</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I was informed of the results of another operation against criminals who worked for the enemy. Employees of the State Bureau of Investigation together with the Security Service of Ukraine detained the former head of the Main Directorate of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. This person was dismissed by me at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and as we can see, that decision was completely justified. Sufficient evidence has been collected to notify this person of suspicion of treason. All his criminal activities are documented. Everything he has done during these months as well as earlier will get a proper legal assessment. Everyone who together with him was part of a criminal group that worked in the interests of the Russian Federation will also be held accountable. It is about the transfer of secret information to the enemy and other facts of cooperation with the Russian special services. I want to thank everyone who participated in this operation. It can truly be called self-purification. I visited the frontline regions - the most difficult ones. I personally dealt with the activities of the law enforcement agencies in particular. As a result of this, as you already know, personnel decisions were made regarding the regional heads of the security sector - Kherson, Kharkiv. We also sorted out the issues of the local leadership of the executive power. The specific actions and any inaction of each official in the security sector and in law enforcement agencies will be evaluated. The corresponding inspection of law enforcement agencies has already yielded the first results and will be continued. As of today, 651 criminal proceedings have been registered regarding treason and collaboration activities of employees of prosecutor&#x27;s offices, pretrial investigation bodies, and other law enforcement agencies. In 198 criminal proceedings, relevant persons were notified of suspicion. In particular, more than 60 employees of the prosecutor&#x27;s office and the Security Service of Ukraine remained in the occupied territory and are working against our state. Such an array of crimes against the foundations of the national security of the state and the connections detected between the employees of the security forces of Ukraine and the special services of Russia pose very serious questions to the relevant leadership. Each of these questions will receive a proper answer. Today I made a decision to suspend the Prosecutor General from office and the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine from discharging duties. I want to be heard today by everyone on whom the extremely sensitive issue of appointing a new head of the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor&#x27;s Office depends. My position as the President of Ukraine is that the competition that took place should lead to a completely logical decision on the appointment of a new head. The appropriate person was selected, and the finalization of this decision depends on the competition commission. Why is this issue sensitive? The answer is obvious. Without a full-fledged head of such an institution, its full--fledged functioning is impossible. By the way, the same applies to the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine. The term of office of the previous head has ended. And there should be a competition procedure for the selection of a new head of NABU. I instructed the Prime Minister of Ukraine to intensify the process of launching the relevant competition. I know that the employees of the anticorruption infrastructure perform their duties at this time and in such conditions. Moreover, they participate in the defense of our state. In particular, seven NABU employees received state awards after February 24. However, the full functionality of any state body can be used only when there is an effective leader. So, this competition is also extremely important. Today, another not-too-sober statement about the alleged &quot;doomsday&quot; for Ukraine was heard from Russia. Of course, no one will perceive such intimidation. But look how cynical it is to say such a thing today - on the anniversary of Russia&#x27;s shooting down of the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over the Ukrainian Donbas. 298 people were killed in an obvious act of terrorism. 80 children. Citizens of ten states. Already then, Russia was following this path - to the status of a terrorist state and to a special tribunal, which will definitely take place regarding Russian aggression against Ukraine. This will be a doomsday for Russia. And not in a figurative sense, not as a loud saying, but literally. As of 19:00 today, Russia has already used more than three thousand cruise missiles against Ukraine. It is impossible to count the number of artillery and other projectiles that were used against our country and our people. But it is definitely possible to bring all Russian war criminals to justice. Each of the collaborators. All those responsible for terror. For everything that happens during 144 days and in more than eight years. It will be done. I spoke today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. Of course, we discussed our cooperation and I thanked him, I thanked Canada for its support. But I separately emphasized that Ukrainians will never accept Canada&#x27;s decision regarding the Nord Stream turbine, which was decided to be handed over to Germany in violation of the sanctions regime. This issue is not just about the turbine. This is a matter of compliance with sanctions. If there is one violation now, it is only a matter of time before there will be others. Russia deliberately does this blackmailing with gas and provoking violations of sanctions. There are enough routes for the transit of Russian gas to Europe. And every country must maintain principles. I am grateful to everyone who fights and defends justice. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Provide information and emotional support to our people in the occupied areas, tell them about Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-18</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, a photo of a guy from Mariupol, who went out to the streets of the city with a Ukrainian flag, went viral. He came to the remains of the drama theater building destroyed by Russian troops. This was very brave. And I want to thank him for this act. This guy is one of many of our people who are waiting for the return of Ukraine and who will not accept the occupation under any circumstances. Russia keeps most of them in an information vacuum. Every day in the occupied territories it spreads new lies about Ukraine and our actions. But despite propaganda and intimidation, people not only remember Ukraine, but also demonstrate what they really think and what they strive for. We never forgot about them. And I ask all of you who have contacts and opportunities for this: spread real information to the occupied territory, support our people, spread the truth there. In any way you find effective. On our entire Ukrainian land from Kherson to Horlivka, from Henichesk to the occupied districts of the Kharkiv region, in Melitopol and Berdyansk, in Enerhodar, in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, in Crimea, our people should hear about Ukraine from Ukrainians. The Armed Forces of our state managed to inflict significant logistical losses on the invaders. It is increasingly difficult for the Russian army to hold positions on the captured territory. Step by step, we advance, disrupt supplies for the occupiers, identify and neutralize collaborators. The prospect is obvious: the Ukrainian flag will be in all our cities and villages. The only question is time. And while this time lasts, while Russia can still destroy life in Ukraine, as it did today with strikes at Nikopol, Toretsk, cities in the Kharkiv region, do not forget to provide information and emotional support to our people in the occupied areas. Tell them about Ukraine. For its part, the state does this. But we must use all the information power of our society. As of today, 1,028 settlements were liberated from the occupiers. Another 2,621 are still under the control of the invaders. And we must maintain information communication with all of them - with all where there are people. As much as possible. I spoke today with President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro about the long-term consequences of the Russian war against Ukraine, the sanctions policy, and the issue of our bilateral relations. And one more important news regarding the Security Service of Ukraine. Personnel audit of the Service is taking place. The issue of dismissal of 28 officials is being considered. Different levels, different directions. But the grounds are similar - unsatisfactory job performance. I am thankful to everyone who faithfully and effectively serves the state! I am thankful to everyone who defends Ukrainian interests at their level. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No matter how the occupiers try to hide, the Armed Forces and our intelligence will ensure retaliatory strikes, and every Russian criminal will be identified - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-19</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Every day, the occupiers give new reasons for recognizing Russia as a terrorist state. Last night, they carried out a missile attack on a village in the Odesa region - 7 sea-based &quot;Kalibr&quot; missiles against an ordinary village. These are not cheap or simple missiles - Russia was very proud of them. And what did they hit? An ordinary rural field and a non-working farm, rural houses, outbuildings, a lyceum, a cultural center. No military sense. Just terror. Fortunately, there were no casualties - people reacted in time to the air-raid warning signal. But six locals were injured, including a 5-month-old child. She and her mother are given all the necessary aid. These are the targets of Russian cruise missiles. And what kind of wimp do you have to be to fulfill commands for such missile strikes at peaceful villages and cities? Even fish and rapana in the Black Sea have more dignity than the officers of the Russian fleet. Over the past day, the targets for Russian shelling were also Nikopol and other settlements of the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Kharkiv region, Mykolaiv, Kramatorsk - a cruise missile hit the center of the city, Slovyansk, Toretsk and other cities of Donbas. Many casualties, many wounded... The occupiers shelled the border areas of the Sumy region. At the captured Zaporizhzhia NPP and in Enerhodar there are new facts of terror against workers and local residents... No matter how the occupiers try to hide, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our intelligence will ensure retaliatory strikes and our state will identify every Russian criminal who is guilty in the terror of Ukrainians. Increasing American support for Ukraine, additional assistance to protect people from Russian terror, addressing humanitarian needs are all the tasks of the ongoing visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to the United States. Today, on the second day of the visit, a meeting at the White House with First Lady Jill Biden took place - President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband came to greet the First Lady of Ukraine. I am grateful to the presidential couple of the United States, all representatives of the American Administration and every American family for their warmth towards our country and our people. And I expect from this visit of the First Lady significant results for Ukraine in cooperation with America. It is important right now. There have already been meetings with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with Samantha Power and other influential female politicians representing the government and parliamentary structures of America. Tomorrow Olena will speak in the Congress - on behalf of all Ukrainian mothers, all Ukrainian women, and it will be an important address. And I really believe that it will be heard by those on whom decision-making in the US depends. Today I had phone conversations with three leaders. I informed President of Poland Andrzej Duda about the situation on the frontline. We discussed further steps in countering Russian aggression. I spoke with Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. I thanked him for his honest and principled position in defense of our common European values. In the evening, I also spoke with the President of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. I informed him about our efforts to counter the food crisis, which was created by Russia and which threatens the world with large-scale hunger. The renewal of the power vertical of the state is in progress. Today I appointed new heads of regional offices of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Zakarpattia, Poltava, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions. I also dismissed one of the deputy heads of the Security Service of Ukraine. I am grateful to the members of the competition commission on the election of the head of the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor&#x27;s Office for finalizing the competition. The decision on the winner has been approved. A new Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine - Oksana Zholnovych - was appointed as well. I expect her to be more active in explaining to people all the nuances of state social policy - specific people&#x27;s rights, payment mechanisms and other opportunities provided by the state. It is also necessary to speed up the modernization of the regulatory framework for social policy, and the role of the minister in this should be significant. It is very important that today the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine implemented the initiative of Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak to set up a special commission to control the use of weapons provided by our partners. The commission included representatives of all parliamentary factions and groups. I want to emphasize: there is no ground for any claims to our state in this regard. Our partners are fully informed about how we use the weapons provided. But in order to put an end to any manipulations of Russian propagandists and those who help them in Ukraine or somewhere else, such an additional parliamentary control tool will enter into force. I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 185 servicemen were awarded state awards, five of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to all who defend and strengthen our state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The representatives of Ukraine did not stop working for a single day to obtain an effective air defense system - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-20</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen how effective the weapons provided by the partners are, especially modern MLRS. The name HIMARS has become almost native to our people - just like Javelin or NLAW, like &quot;Stugna&quot; or &quot;Neptune&quot; earlier. And it is obvious that the next equally important name will appear from modern air defense systems, which we are requesting from partners. The representatives of our state did not stop working for a single day to obtain an effective air defense system. And we have certain agreements on this, there is certain success that allows us to destroy part of the missiles, but a completely different speed and scale of protection is required. But everything depends, unfortunately, not on us, but on political decisions that can be made in key capitals. And that is why this topic of air defense became key today in the speech of the First Lady of Ukraine in the Congress of the United States of America. It was the first time in history that the First Lady made such an address to the Congress, and it is certainly an honor for Ukraine, for all our people. The speech was as practical and sincere as possible - actually on behalf of all our families. Olena spoke about the victims of Russian terror and about the real opportunity for our American friends to help us stop this terror. This can be our joint victory - of the Ukrainian and American nations. I am hopeful that the answers to our requests will be provided shortly. Russian terror must lose. Today, I discussed the issue of increasing pressure on Russia for the war and additional support for Ukraine during a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of Austria and the Czech Republic who visited Kyiv. I thanked both countries for the assistance already provided and outlined the needs for the near future. The Czech Republic holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and it is therefore important that the Czech leadership retains all available power. During these six months, we must take basic steps to prepare for the beginning of negotiations regarding Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the EU. I also spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel. Financial support for Ukraine is among the main topics. We are preparing for the next Ukraine-EU Summit, as well as for the institutional strengthening of our state on the path to the European Union. Soon there may be important news in this regard - we are preparing some historic decisions for our participation in the life of a united Europe. The seventh sanctions package of the European Union is in the final stage of approval. Its elements have already been announced, including a ban on the import of Russian gold. But this is not enough, and I frankly tell my partners about it. Russia must feel a much higher price for the war so that it forces it to seek peace. And now it is worth looking at what is happening on the European energy market. We see how erroneous the policy of some old leaders of European countries, who made Europe hostage to gas supplies from Russia, was. And while the EU does not dare include gas in the sanctions packages, Russia uses gas for its own sanctions against every European family, literally hitting the family budgets of Europeans with pressure on the energy markets. Ukraine has always said that Russia cannot be considered a reliable supplier of gas. And if our position had been listened to earlier, there would be no need now to look for emergency ways to fill the deficit that Russia is artificially creating on the European market. When we turn to our partners with this or that request, with this or that advice or demand, it is based on the experience of Ukraine - on what we have already experienced. Russia is testing in Ukraine everything that can be used against other European countries. It started with gas wars and ended with a full-scale invasion, missile terror and burned cities of Ukraine. And so that this does not happen to anyone else, we must ensure a tangible joint victory over Russia in Ukraine. The sooner this is done, the less damage and suffering will be experienced by all European families, all European countries. Therefore, after the approval of the seventh package of sanctions, it will be necessary to immediately start working on the eighth. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the supply of modern weapons to Ukraine, to provide our state with effective air defense. We will do everything so that our partners have this understanding and for it to never weaken. I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukrainians on the way to victory! I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We have a significant potential for the advance of our forces on the front and for the infliction of significant losses on the occupiers - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-21</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief - this format of our work brings together key leaders of the defense and security sectors. We listened to the reports of Head of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine Kyrylo Budanov, Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service Oleksandr Lytvynenko, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhny, Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, as well as Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrskyi. Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander of the Land Forces, joined the Staff meeting directly from the frontline. We discussed the current situation on the frontline, around Ukraine. We defined tasks in some tactical areas to strengthen our positions. And we also thoroughly worked out the issue of providing the troops with the modern weapons - the intensity of attacks on the enemy still needs to be increased. The participants of the Staff meeting agreed that we have a significant potential for the advance of our forces on the front and for the infliction of significant new losses on the occupiers. Today, Head of my Office Andriy Yermak and General Zaluzhny had another conversation with US President&#x27;s National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan and United States Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley. In this two-on-two format, all key issues of cooperation in the defense sphere between Ukraine and the United States are constantly discussed. I held negotiations with the President of Costa Rica - for the first time in the history of relations between our states. I thanked him for his support of Ukraine - it is felt, for countering Russian propaganda and the introduction of sanctions. And I will continue to do everything possible so that the truth about Russia&#x27;s actions against Ukraine is known in every part of the world. Our diplomacy is constantly creating new ties with countries that have not been the focus of Ukrainian foreign policy for a long time. And tomorrow we also expect news for our state from Turkey - regarding the unblocking of our ports. Against the background of such regular military-political and diplomatic activity, it was a little strange to hear today an old-new fake of Russian propaganda about me. That I am allegedly in an intensive care unit, that Ruslan Stefanchuk is allegedly performing the duties of the head of state. Well, what can I say... Earlier, almost every week, Russian propagandists and officials spreaded fakes that I allegedly fled somewhere from Ukraine or that I allegedly did not fulfill my duties. Then it all stopped. And here such primitive things are thrown in again. It seems that the occupiers are even running out of ammunition of lies - they are unable to come up with anything new. The existing potential for all forms of Russian aggression will certainly be exhausted as well, including for offensive actions on the front and terror against our cities. We will do everything to speed it up. And this is exactly what we emphasize in all contacts with our partners. Today, the Russian army again shelled the Saltivka district of Kharkiv with rocket artillery - purely civilian objects. Residential building, trade pavilions, public transport. As of this time, three people are known to have died, and more than twenty people are on the list of wounded. The occupiers also fired at the Slovyansk community in Donbas with &quot;Uragans&quot; and hit Kramatorsk with &quot;Iskanders&quot;. And each of these Russian strikes is an argument for Ukraine to receive more HIMARS and other modern and effective weapons. Each of these shelling occasions only strengthens our desire to defeat the occupiers - it will certainly happen. A few months ago, our expert group chaired by Yermak and McFaul suggested recognizing Russia&#x27;s actions against Ukraine as genocide. And here is the first real result of the visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to the United States - Senators Risch, Cardin, Wicker, Blumenthal, Portman, Shaheen and Graham presented a draft resolution on recognition of Russia&#x27;s actions in Ukraine as genocide. The resolution states that Russia&#x27;s actions in Ukraine, which include forced deportation to Russia and the targeted killing of Ukrainian civilians during mass atrocities, are genocide against the people of Ukraine. The senators introduced the resolution shortly after Olena delivered an address directly to the US Congress. According to the draft document, the US Senate condemns Russia for committing acts of genocide against the people of Ukraine; calls on the United States, together with NATO and EU allies, to support the government of Ukraine to prevent further acts of Russian genocide against the Ukrainian people; supports tribunals and international criminal investigations to hold Russian political leaders and military personnel accountable for war of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. With all its terrorist attacks against Ukrainians and our country, Russia is only burying itself. In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 186 combatants were awarded state awards. Eternal gratitude to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia did everything to destroy Ukraine&#x27;s export potential; we didn&#x27;t allow it – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainian men and women! Dear all our defenders Today, our state and the entire civilized world have reached an important agreement – we have an agreement that allows us to unblock Ukrainian ports and restore Ukrainian agricultural exports. From the first day of the full-scale invasion, Russia did everything to not just close Ukraine&#x27;s access to the sea, but to destroy the very potential of our exports – port infrastructure, our railways, warehouses and silos. We did not allow it. And now we can not only restore the operation of our ports on the Black Sea, but also keep them protected. This has been worked out with our military and with our intelligence. The military assured me of one hundred percent control of the approaches to our ports. For a long time, all the details of the initiative signed today in Istanbul were discussed with our key international partners and the United Nations. Many leaders were involved in helping to restore our exports by sea. And I am grateful to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for their efforts. The text of the document signed today is published, and everyone can read its points. They fully meet the interests of Ukraine. First. About 20 million tonnes of last year&#x27;s grain harvest will be exported. And also it will be possible to sell this year&#x27;s harvest – and it is already being harvested. These are the incomes of farmers, the entire agricultural sector and the state budget. These are jobs. These are funds for next year&#x27;s sowing season. We now have approximately $10 billion worth of grain. Secondly. Finally, there is a chance to reduce the severity of the food crisis provoked by Russia. There is a chance to prevent a global catastrophe – a famine that could lead to political chaos in many countries of the world, in particular in the countries that help us. And the thirdly. This is another illustration that Ukraine is able to withstand this war. It is important that everything in the territorial waters of Ukraine will be controlled by our state. And it is clear to everyone that there may be some provocations on the part of Russia, some attempts to discredit Ukrainian and international efforts. But we trust the UN. Now, it is their responsibility and responsibility of international partners to ensure compliance with the agreements. And I want to thank all our soldiers who cleared Snake Island from the enemy, defend Odesa and Mykolaiv, gradually advance in Kherson region, liberating our territory. I&#x27;m thankful to all of you who proves every day: Russia will not win this war. We are preparing for the start of the second Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen tomorrow. This initiative of the First Lady of Ukraine was founded last year and proved that it can turn the soft power of the wives and husbands of the leaders of the states to solving various problems of national and global scale. This year&#x27;s summit will be devoted to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. And it&#x27;s not just about reconstruction. It is about the return of people, that is, about displaced people who should not become refugees. About all the necessary help and rehabilitation for those who suffered from the war. And about the revival of social life in communities and cities that were destroyed by the occupiers. In particular, within the framework of the Summit and on the basis of our public charity platform United24, fundraising for specialized ambulances for Ukraine has already begun. I won&#x27;t reveal everything prepared by the First Lady of Ukraine and her team, but I feel that it will be a powerful event from a diplomatic point of view. I spoke today with a great friend of Ukraine, Boris Johnson. First of all, about security and defense cooperation. We are waiting for a new package of military support. Relations between Ukraine and the UK are built on common values. And no matter what happens in politics, the ties between our countries and societies will only strengthen. In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. 180 combatants were given state awards, 100 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for the independence of Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who fight for our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The war did not break Ukraine and will not break or stop life in our country – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the second Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-23</span></div>
  <p>Dear First Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Ladies and gentlemen presidents! Dear guests of the Summit! Dear all our native Ukrainians! I am extremely pleased to be here today, to participate with you in the opening of the second Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen. Olena just said how important it is that during the war we keep up the pace of our activity and do not give in to the circumstances. 150 days. After eight years. The war did not break Ukraine and will not break it, did not stop life in our country and will not stop it. And it will definitely not make us hostages of the terror that the invaders brought to our beautiful, peaceful and strong state. The main topic of this Summit is the post-war recovery of Ukraine, the human dimension of this recovery. Why are we talking about reconstruction now, when the war is not yet over? So that on the first day of peace you can feel it fully. So that there was already a systematic reconstruction of everything that was destroyed by the Russian army. So that there are already security guarantees for our people. So that people already know where and how they can return if they went abroad to escape hostilities. So that the medical system restores its strong capacity. So that parents do not have any unanswered questions about education, first of all for their children. So that people know for sure that there are jobs for them in Ukraine and there is a choice of how to express themselves. And that all our respectable men and women veterans, who have gone through the hell of battles, really feel the gratitude of our state. I just met at Bankova Street with the congressmen of the United States of America, who came to support us and you, all Ukrainians, in the fight for the main thing – for freedom. The delegation was led by Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Adam Smith. And it was felt that our conversation about the further increase of aid was a continuation of all our previous talks and, in particular, the meetings of the First Lady of Ukraine in Washington. We see that the address of the First Lady of Ukraine in the U.S. Congress was also heard – there is activity both regarding weapons for Ukraine and regarding the legal response to what Russia is doing against our independence and our state. Today, this important Summit will contribute to the protection of the state and overcoming the consequences of Russian terrorist attacks. We are harnessing the power of our society and seeing results. Ukraine has the largest global support in its history - our anti-war coalition includes dozens of countries: from Canada to New Zealand, from Japan and the United States to the UK and every friendly country in Europe. We have established the kind of connections with our partners that allow us already five months to oppose an army that has been building for the purpose of our destruction for decades. We are building new relations with many countries of the world. Contacts with the countries of Africa and Latin America were intensified only during these months. Many of them are at this level for the first time: Guatemala, Ecuador, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Mozambique, Cote d&#x27;Ivoire, etc. The President of Indonesia – one of the largest Islamic countries in the world and the leader in ASEAN – visited Kyiv for the first time. Ukraine participated three times in the G7 meetings, we have an invitation to the G20 summit. We started a new form of diplomatic activity – systematic and large-scale appeals to the parliaments and peoples of the world. And they showed that it can be more powerful than all other forms of conventional diplomacy. We also launched a fundamentally new public charity platform, UNITED24, which helps to unite the potential of different societies, civic activism on different continents of the world, efforts of business and the cultural sphere to implement specific projects for the protection and restoration of our state, which we now very much need. Outstanding people have already become Ambassadors for the UNITED24 platform, outstanding athletes Andriy Shevchenko and Elina Svitolina, actor Liev Schreiber, and now it is also the Imagine Dragons band – I spoke with them last night. Over UAH 5 billion have already been raised during the existence of our charity platform. We achieved such a result in relations with the European Union, which seemed to many to be a fantasy, when we here in Kyiv, on the fifth day of the war, signed the application for joining the EU. And now for people it is just a part of the usual reality – the fact that Ukraine is officially recognized as an EU candidate. And I believe that peace in Ukraine, and the reconstruction of our country, and the return of our beautiful people from abroad, and the further movement of our state into a united Europe will become equally common facts. Is this possible? We all don&#x27;t just feel, we know that all these things are possible. And it will be so! Otherwise, this second Summit in particular would not have happened. There wouldn&#x27;t be all its participants and there wouldn&#x27;t be this attention that I see now. Because this is attention to the future of our Ukraine, which we will make together, which we will build despite everything, despite the war. I am sure that today in the addresses and discussions, talks at the panels of the Summit, we will be able to hear a lot of very important, useful things. This is the Summit of those whose power, though soft, is always invincible. I thank you all for participating! I thank our friends, close friends from Latvia, Lithuania, from all continents of the world, who will join us today. Thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Armed Forces of Ukraine advancing step by step in Kherson region – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-23</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainian men and women! The one hundred and fiftieth day of our defense against Russia, against their invasion, is coming to an end. And this day is in some ways similar to all the previous ones – missile strikes again, heavy fighting in many areas of the front – Donbas, Kharkiv region, shelling again. But this day also shows how far we have come towards our victory. It will be! First of all, we can say now about Kherson region. The occupiers tried to gain a foothold there, their collaborators made various brazen statements, which in Russian are called the very apt word &quot;shapkozakidatelstvo&quot; (false forecasts)... But how did it help them? The Armed Forces of Ukraine are advancing step by step in the region. Today&#x27;s Russian missile attack on Odesa, on our port, is a cynical one, and it was also a blow to the political positions of Russia itself. If anyone in the world could still say that some kind of dialogue with it, with Russia, some kind of agreements are needed, see what is happening. Today&#x27;s Russian Kalibr missiles have destroyed the very possibility for such statements. And we see the absolute unanimity of the world&#x27;s reaction to this strike. The occupiers can no longer deceive anyone. Among other things, as a result of this strike, the building of the Odesa Art Museum was also damaged. The missiles hit very close to the historical objects of Odesa – something that is an asset not only for Ukrainian culture, but also for the culture of Europe. This apparent Russian barbarism brings us even closer to obtaining the very weapons we need for our victory. Today in the capital of Ukraine, I held talks with U.S. congressmen led by Adam Smith, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. And we understand each other from half a word. And this also reflects the way we have passed during all these days – days of war. By the way, I want to thank the people of the United States, President Biden for the new $270 million security assistance package. I spoke today with the President of Kazakhstan, Mr. Tokayev. I thanked him for his fundamental support for Ukraine, our sovereignty, and international law. We discussed specific projects in the fields of energy, economy, digitalization. And, finally, today the second annual Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen took place in Kyiv. This year, it gathered even more participants. It united Kyiv with Warsaw, Brussels, London, and Washington. It united top politicians, public figures of other countries and our soldiers. Representatives of business, sports, media. Writers, show business stars, educators, doctors... In today&#x27;s world, it is impossible to make do with the usual conventional diplomacy. We need soft power, we need the sincere desire of different societies to help the state, which is fighting for its indomitability and independence. And from this point of view, it has become very successful today. The initiative of the First Lady of Ukraine in two years actually became a traditional format – unique for the world community. Everyone recognizes the potential of soft power. But only Ukraine managed to direct its indomitability, its potential into concrete diplomatic practice. And in general, in these almost five months, we have achieved such large-scale and diplomatic support for Ukraine that Russia will not be able to oppose it. The day will come when missiles will lose their meaning for the occupiers. Now, it is possible to shoot down some of the missiles. The goal is to shoot down each one. And we will do everything necessary to still get modern and effective air defense systems. It&#x27;s our goal. The terrorist state provides new arguments for this every day. As of today, almost 24,000 defenders of Ukraine have been given state awards for their bravery. A total of 160 soldiers were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Millions of our people joined the defense of our state. And I am sincerely grateful to them, each of them. Our independence is our joint achievement. Victory will be shared. It will definitely be! I know it. I believe in it. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The Day of Ukrainian Statehood on July 28 will assert the connection of many generations of our people - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-24</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! An important, symbolic week begins tomorrow. The week when we will first celebrate the Day of Ukrainian Statehood on July 28. For the first time. Celebrate at the time of such a brutal war - in the sixth month of it. After eight years of war in Donbas. But we will celebrate. Despite all. Because Ukrainians cannot be broken. The Day of Ukrainian Statehood will assert the connection of Ukrainians living now with many generations of our people. The state-building experience of Ukrainians, our culture, our identity, Ukrainian character are more than a thousand years old. Now, in many exploits of our warriors, in the wisdom of our people in battles, even simply in the conversations of ordinary Ukrainians about what is happening, we can see, we can hear and understand examples of the same characters but hundreds of years ago. We can see examples of the same bravery, the same attitude to life, and most importantly, the attitude towards Ukraine and the enemy. Only those who do not know the truth of history and do not feel its meaning could decide to attack us. After all that our people have gone through, after all that we have learned over the centuries. Ukrainians will never give up their independence. And they will not break from the inside as has happened more than once. Not this time! Preserving unity now, working together for the victory is the most important national task that we all will definitely fulfill. And therefore, we will be able to do what previous generations could not do before. This applies to our defense in this war for independence, to our course towards a united Europe, towards full membership in the EU, and our ability to become one of the most modern states in the world. There is no one now who would doubt this. There are only those who argue about how to achieve this. It will happen. This is a sign of faith in Ukraine - not only our own faith. Even the occupiers admit that we will win. We hear it in their conversations – all the time, in what they tell their loved ones when they contact them. Therefore, we do not slow down and, as every day for five months, we are doing everything to inflict the greatest possible losses on the enemy and to gather as much support as possible for Ukraine. This week there will be important visits of partners, there will be important negotiations, and most importantly, there will be the further advancement of Ukrainian positions. At the front, in diplomacy, in the economy. I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! And I wish all of us, all Ukrainians, a fruitful new week. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The gas war that Russia is waging against Europe is a form of terror, so it is necessary to hit back - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-25</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! The visit of the President of Guatemala to Kyiv took place today - the first in all the years of our independence. And the thing is not only that we received full support from this Latin American state, but also that our relations with it are a bridge to the entire region of Latin America. Ukrainian diplomacy is gradually opening up new broad directions for our society - Central and South America, Africa, countries of the Arab world, South and Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, there was not enough attention paid to these macro-regions. And this is tangible when it is necessary to accumulate support for Ukraine, in particular on international platforms. I am grateful to Guatemala and Mr. President Giammattei, with whom I held talks today, for the principled and consistent condemnation of Russian aggression and participation in the defense of the international legal order. Crises created by Russia affect everyone in the world, and no one will manage to stay aside when Russia provokes chaos in the food market, in the energy markets or simply in international relations. Following the negotiations, I am sure that Ukraine&#x27;s position will be heard in Latin America. We agreed with Mr. President on the abolition of visa restrictions and the reboot of trade and economic relations between our countries. Today we saw another gas threat to Europe. Even despite the concession regarding the Nord Stream turbine, Russia is not going to resume gas supplies to European countries, as it is contractually obligated to do. All this is done by Russia deliberately to make it as difficult as possible for Europeans to prepare for winter. And this is an overt gas war that Russia is waging against a united Europe - this is exactly how it should be perceived. And they don&#x27;t care what will happen to the people, how they will suffer - from hunger due to the blocking of ports or from winter cold and poverty... Or from occupation. These are just different forms of terror. And that&#x27;s why it is necessary to hit back. Do not think about the way to return some turbine, but strengthen sanctions. Do everything to limit Russian revenues not only from gas and oil, but also from any remaining exports. And sever trade ties with Russia as much as possible, because every such tie is Russia’s potential tool of putting pressure. The gas blackmail of Europe, which only gets worse every month, is needed by a terrorist state to make life worse for every European. And this can actually be perceived as an incentive for the EU&#x27;s eighth sanctions package to be significantly stronger than the recently approved seventh. I have adopted important personnel decisions today. In particular, Head of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine Kyrylo Budanov will also chair the Committee on Intelligence under the President of Ukraine. Combat General Viktor Khorenko has been appointed the new Commander of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And General Hryhoriy Halahan was transferred to another direction and, with the aim of updating the Security Service of Ukraine, was appointed the First Deputy Head of the Special Operations Center &quot;A&quot; of the Security Service of Ukraine. And separately, I would like to express gratitude today to our airborne assault troops, the Sicheslav brigade, which &quot;landed&quot; two Russian military aircraft and one helicopter - in a little more than one day. We must do everything to extend such a &quot;landing&quot; experience to all Russian aircraft and missile products in our skies. Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The democracies of the world are capable of stopping any tyranny - speech by the President of Ukraine during the awarding of the Winston Churchill Leadership Award </h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-26</span></div>
  <p>Friend Boris! Dear members of the Churchill Society! Dear members of the Ukrainian Warrior Games team, I know that you are also there! Dear guests! It is an extraordinary honor for me to receive such a leadership award today. And, receiving it, it is very appropriate to recall one of the most famous words of Winston Churchill, which he said on May 8, 1945, after the end of the war in Europe: &quot;My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. It&#x27;s a victory of the great British nation as a whole&quot;. And now I can quite rightly say that this award is not only for me and it reflects not only my efforts. It would not be possible without all of us, it would not be possible without one hundred and sixty Ukrainian soldiers who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine for the period from February 24. It would not be possible without more than twenty-four thousand Ukrainian men and women who have been awarded our state awards for bravery in the battles against the Russian terrorist invasion. This award would not be possible if the entire Ukrainian people had not risen up to defend freedom from the attack of tyranny, as Boris said now, a tyranny that is trying to return us to the worst that happened in the XX century and that was then defeated thanks to the factor of Churchill in particular. But not only. Not only this is reflected now. Something else should be said as well. Ukrainians and European history will always remember those who did not hesitate to come to the aid of our people and the very idea of freedom. Addressing Londoners celebrating the victory, Winston Churchill recalled that Britain had stood alone for a whole year against the greatest military power of the time. And it did not quit the struggle, did not obey. And it created an example for all nations fighting against tyranny. An example of the fact that victory is possible if you remember what honor is and do not deviate from your principles. When we celebrate our victory, which we surely will, we will be able to say, thankfully, a little bit different words than those said by Sir Churchill. Because Ukraine was not left alone after February 24. With us were those who helped us, who remembered at the worst time what honor is, and who &quot;had no thought of quitting the struggle&quot;. I&#x27;m talking about you now, Boris. This award is yours, too. This showed our joint leadership - Ukrainians, British and everyone who will never give up freedom to some tyrants, no matter what weapon they use against us. The price of freedom is extremely high. But still, it is incomparably higher for those who gave it up and are trying to return it than for those who protect it with all their might. We are defending. We are fighting. Just like during the terrible trials of the XX century. Just as then, the factor of personal leadership is now crucial. Leadership on the battlefield. Leadership in helping the active army. Leadership in international relations. And although the stakes in this war are different, they are no less high than 80 years ago. What are we fighting for now? Not just for the land, although for it too, of course. Not just for human rights or the right of one nation, the Ukrainians, to live independently, although for them too, of course. Not just for freedom in Europe or everywhere on the borders of Russia, although it will be guaranteed as a consequence of our victory. We are fighting together to ensure that war is never again seen by any aggressor as a means of achieving aggressive goals. And perhaps for the first time in the history of mankind we are now able to show everyone in the world and for ages that democracies, united, can stop any tyranny, even if at first it seems that it has unlimited resources for aggression. But this can become a reality only if Russia loses on the battlefield in Ukraine. That is why it is necessary to continue the supply of modern and effective weapons to our state in sufficient quantities to finally break the offensive potential of Russian tyranny. Sanctions against Russia must be strengthened and applied against all those who commit or support terror. And it is necessary to involve more nations in our coalition for the defense of freedom - especially those against whom Russia in the XXI century decided to use one of the most terrible types of weapons - hunger, artificial hunger. The democracies of the world are capable of stopping any tyranny. We are capable of stopping any evil that threatens our freedom. Only the joint leadership of the entire free world can be enough for this. And patience should be enough. Patience on the way to victory. No one knows today how much time and effort it will take to reach it. However, the victory is worth the effort. And it will become our shared history. So outstanding that you and I will later be quoted in the same way as we are now quoting Sir Churchill. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for the award - the award of the people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukrainian bravery inspires all free nations, and just imagine how inspiring our victory will be - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-26</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Unbreakable people of the strongest country! Today, the occupiers hit the Odesa region again, firing missiles at ordinary houses again. Missiles designed to destroy warships and other significant targets. It is with such heavy weapons that the Russian army destroys the ordinary private sector near the sea. People lived and had a vacation there... And we will certainly hit back for this, no matter what lies the Russian Ministry of Defense tells about such strikes. The constant Russian terror of Kharkiv and the region, Mykolaiv, towns and villages of the Zaporizhzhia region and Dnipropetrovsk region, Donbas, border areas of the Sumy region and Chernihiv region - for all this the occupiers will not go unpnished. For four months, the Russian state has not provided to its citizens any information - even censored - about the losses of the occupation contingent. Total silence. Nothing was published or said in numerous interviews and speeches at the political and military levels. However, this number is already almost 40,000 - that is how many killed people the Russian army has lost since February 24. And tens of thousands more were wounded and maimed. And if the Russian state does not say this officially, even in general terms, everyone who still has any contacts in Russia or informational influence on their society should convey this simple fact to whomever possible. Among the occupiers only those killed are 40 thousand. Today it became known that Britain has expanded the list of sanctions against Russia. Dozens more people and organizations were added. This is the right trend, and I am grateful to Britain for its unwavering firmness in sanctions matters. This is an example that should be followed by everyone else in the Western world. In particular, today&#x27;s news about another provoked increase in gas prices on the European market above 2,000 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters is already a sufficient reason to expand sanctions against Russia. Because it is clear to everyone that this is a deliberate price terror by Russia against Europe. Using Gazprom, Moscow is doing everything to make this winter the toughest for European countries. It is necessary to respond to terror - respond with sanctions. Today, for the first time in the history of interstate relations between Ukraine and Uruguay, I held negotiations with Mr. President of this Latin American country. I thanked for support in international organizations and called on Uruguay, like other states in the Latin American region, to impose sanctions on Russia. We will do everything so that there is not a single region left in the world where the truth about Russian aggression is not understood. We already have communication with Chile, Paraguay, Costa Rica. And now - Uruguay. We’ll continue this work. And a few more significant events that are worth mentioning. Today, the Winston Churchill Leadership Award ceremony was held in London with the participation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. I believe that this is an award of all our heroes, all our people, all of us who are resisting tyranny each at their own level. And it was really an honor for me to receive this award. Today, in the Netherlands - a country for the understanding of which we’ve been working for a long time - the Ukrainian people were honored with another award - a special Dutch Independence Award. Our ambassador received it on behalf of Ukrainians. These iconic things also reflect the radical changes in the attitude towards Ukraine that have taken place in the world. Our bravery is truly an inspiration for all free nations and the community of democracies in general. And just imagine how inspiring the Ukrainian victory will be. In the evening, I signed a decree awarding our warriors. 198 combatants were awarded state awards of Ukraine. Two of them – posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all those who fight for the independence of our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every week we strengthen Ukraine, get closer to the European Union, provide forces to confront Russia - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-27</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on the passing day. First of all, about the Antonivsky bridge in Kherson and other crossings in the region. Of course, they will all be rebuilt, but by us already. We are doing everything to ensure that the occupiers do not have any logistical opportunities on our land. Whatever plans they have, we will disrupt them. And we will liberate our territory with military, diplomatic and all other available means until we reach the legal borders of Ukraine. Second, today the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved the appointment of a new Prosecutor General, Andriy Kostin. The person is decent, professional, he knows how to work systematically. Society considers the provision of everything necessary to hold Russia accountable for the war as one of his most important tasks. This is cooperation with the International Criminal Court, with partner states that help identify specific culprits among the Russian military; this is the recording of the facts of the crimes committed by the occupiers, ensuring the formation of an evidentiary base for the criminal prosecution of every war criminal. The Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office is one of the key institutions working to hold all Russian murderers and torturers accountable for their crimes against Ukrainians. Third, we are preparing to increase our export of electricity to consumers in the European Union. Despite such a war, we ensured the connection of the energy grid of Ukraine to the energy system of the entire Europe in record time. Our exports allow us not only to earn foreign currency, but also to help our partners withstand Russian energy pressure. We will gradually make Ukraine one of the guarantors of European energy security thanks to our domestic electricity production. Fourth, we are preparing for very important political and diplomatic events scheduled for the second half of this week. First of all, this concerns tomorrow&#x27;s celebration of the Day of Ukrainian Statehood. But not only that. There will be more events, there will be more news. Every week we strengthen our state, every week we do things that bring us closer to the European Union, and every week we provide additional forces to confront Russia. Fifth, a joint meeting of the International Sanctions Group was held today under the leadership of Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul with the participation of representatives of the Ukrainian Parliament – the leadership of the Verkhovna Rada, factions and groups. New solutions are being developed that will increase the price for the war for Russia. In particular, there is an initiative to strengthen responsibility at the level of the European Union for evasion of sanctions and an initiative on mandatory disclosure of information about any business contacts, joint ownership of corporate rights and property with citizens of Russia. The Yermak-McFaul sanctions group will coordinate its work with representatives of our parliament. And one more thing. During the full-scale war, I awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to 160 Ukrainian warriors. And among them is one of the most effective Ukrainian pilots, Major Oleksandr Kukurba. In April, in the Mariyinsky Palace, in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine, I presented the Gold Star Order to him. Major Kukurba died in battle yesterday. It was his hundredth combat sortie. A real Ukrainian hero whom we will always remember. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to everyone who defends our state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>All stages of the history of Ukrainian statehood can be described in one sentence: we existed, exist and will exist - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the occasion of Ukrainian Statehood Day</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-28</span></div>
  <p>The great people of the great country and the great state, which existed on this land from time immemorial, and from time immemorial there have been attempts to both enslave and destroy it. By many people and many times. And which has not allowed it to be done from time immemorial. Never to anyone. The state in which the history of Christianity in Eastern Europe began, when it was baptized 1034 years ago by the Great Prince Volodymyr of Kyiv. The state in which the history of indomitability began, which is now admired by all of Europe and the whole world. This is our state. Our country. This is Ukraine. The history of its state formation dates back thousands of years. But only this year we celebrate the Day of Ukrainian Statehood for the first time. We do not need fireworks and pomp to show the importance of our own statehood for the Ukrainian people. Today we defend it with weapons in hands. For 155 days in a row. We can say that for us, Statehood Day is every day. Every day we fight so that everyone on the planet finally understands: we are not a colony, not an enclave, not a protectorate. Not a gubernia, an eyalet or a crown land, not a part of foreign empires, not a &quot;part of the land&quot;, not a union republic. Not an autonomy, not a province, but a free, independent, sovereign, indivisible and independent state. It originates at least one and a half thousand years ago. Since the date officially recognized by the UN and UNESCO, when Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv and Lybid founded the capital of Ukraine. It is the only legal heiress of Kyivan Rus’, the possessions and achievements of our rulers. Askold and Dir, Vishchy Oleg, Prince Igor, Equal-to-the-Apostles Princess Olga, Sviatoslav the Brave, Volodymyr the Great, Yaroslav the Wise, Volodymyr Monomakh, King Danylo. It is the heiress of the Cossack State. Homeland of Bayda Vyshnevetsky, Sahaidachny, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Ivan Mazepa, Pylyp Orlyk. It is the legal successor of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and the Ukrainian State of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Independence and unity proclaimed by the universals of the Central Rada and the Unification Act. It has a rich tradition of law-making, writing and diplomacy. &quot;Rus’ka Pravda&quot;, Annales Bertiniani, Ostromyr Gospels, Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk and hundreds of other sources and documents that contain written references to our state and its recognition by other states and rulers. It has glorious military traditions. It is the homeland of famous warriors, indomitable fighters for their own freedom and statehood. In Rus’, in Sich, on the battlefields of the First and Second World Wars. In Kholodny Yar, in the Carpathian forests, near Kruty. All stages of the history of Ukraine&#x27;s statehood, its defense and struggle for it can be described in one sentence: we existed, exist and will exist! We will exist, because our state has incredible sons and daughters who have stood up for its defense. The names of Sviatoslav the Brave, King Danylo, Hetmans Sahaidachny, Khmelnytsky, Vyhovsky, Apostol, generals Handziuk and Almazov are written on their war flags and khorugvs. They bear the honorific names of &quot;Knights of the Winter Campaign&quot;, &quot;Sich Riflemen&quot;, &quot;Chorni Zaporozhtsi&quot; and &quot;Kholodnoyarivtsi&quot;. They and millions of our other warriors defend Ukraine under the names of their ancestors. With responsibility to them. And we feel their support. The support of all generations of fighters for an independent Ukraine. Our warriors defend Ukraine on the ground, in the water and in the air. Our ancestors defend it from the skies. And all of them together are our angels. Our angels have wings. But under them there are weapons. We never take weapons first. But if our home is attacked, we stand to the last. Because, losing its own state, any nation loses primarily not its territory. Not hectares or square kilometers of land or water. When a nation loses its own state, it loses its own face. Its own name. Its originality, identity, memory, and with them its heart and soul. And this is much scarier for us than enemy armies, planes, missiles and tanks. That is why millions of us are ready to stop them without fear. And defend the most valuable at the cost of one&#x27;s life. Because having lost what is meaningful to us, we lose the meaning of life itself. Because for us, living in captivity is not living. Being dependent is not being. Because a non-independent and unfree Ukraine is not Ukraine. We do not know the word &quot;slavery&quot;. It is in our dictionaries, but not in our heads. We will give our last shirt, we will give everything we have for what is in our heart. That is why we will fight for our statehood to the last - the last breath, the last bullet, the last soldier. Not ours, but the enemy&#x27;s. We will live to fight and fight to live. We will not give up until we drive the last occupier out of our home. We will not stop until we liberate the last meter of Ukrainian land. We will not rest until we liberate our last village, our last house, our last well, our last cherry tree, our last willow tree! It will be so. And it will only be so! Because for us and for the occupier, all this has completely different, polar meanings. Targets for them are shrines for us. Unknown names on the map for them are places familiar from childhood for us. They fulfill other people&#x27;s criminal orders, we fulfill our sacred duty. We are fighting for different things, so the end of this battle will also be different for both of us. By meaning. And even by the sound. In Russian, this is the failure of a special operation. In Ukrainian, this is victory in the war! That is why it will happen. That is why our state will exist. Congratulations on the Day of Christianization of Kyivan Rus’ - Ukraine! Congratulations on Ukrainian Statehood Day! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Verkhovna Rada session on the occasion of the Day of Ukrainian Statehood</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-28</span></div>
  <p>Dear Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, Dear friend Gitanas, Dear Mrs. President Roberta Metsola, Dear deputies, dear government officials, Dear military, And all our citizens of Ukraine! We are citizens of the strongest state in the world. The state that is at war. The state, which at the same time is being reformed. And the state that ensured the most powerful unification of democracies in history. The state, which on the 155th day of Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against us, has the strength to celebrate its day - the Day of Ukrainian Statehood. We ensured that the values of the free world did not remain mere rhetoric and actually started working to protect civilization. We made the European Union the most united in all the years of its existence, and it is getting stronger thanks to our strength. We ensured that all the tyrants of this world saw the potential of democracy. This was done by us, the citizens of Ukraine. All of us - military and civilians, diplomats and volunteers, civil servants and businesses, politicians, social leaders and media... Each and every one who worked conscientiously at his and her level for the sake of one thing - for the sake of Ukraine, one’s family and our future. We, the citizens of a state, which has over a thousand years of history, did it. Over a thousand years of its culture. Over a thousand years of its character - Ukrainian character, unbreakable one. Which endured on our land under the hits of many invaders... Where have you come, the Russian army blinded by your pathetic ambitions? You’ve come up against us - those who were prepared for this crucial war for independence by dozens and dozens of generations of the Ukrainian people who lived and live here, who fought and fight here, who built and build here and who dreamed and dreams above everything else that there is no someone else’s rule over them and Ukraine. It&#x27;s time for this dream to become a reality forever. This is our time! We will make this dream come true. We will become not a new legend of heroic resistance, but a state of winners. Not 300 Spartans, worthy of films, books and plays, but the multimillion-strong nation-hero which is worthy of living, worthy of winning and which will teach others in the world how to defend themselves and how to win. We will be remembered not as those who tried, but as those who preserved, strengthened and passed our state to our children so that they could pass it on to their children. A free, strong, modern and efficient state. We will do it - we, citizens of Ukraine. Friend Gitanas Nausėda, dear Mr. President! I want to thank you and - in your person - the entire Lithuanian people today, on the Day of our Statehood, for the significant, important, heroic support that Ukraine received. Thank you! It was not politics for our states - it reflects the equally strong love for freedom of our nations. Nations who walked and keep walking together through European history. Thank you again! Mrs. Roberta, Mrs. President of the European Parliament! I would like to note your bravery. You visited Kyiv at a time when the invaders’ army was threatening our capital, and you were the first among the heads of EU institutions to do so. At that time we saw our character in your bravery, we saw our person - a person who will always defend the values of Europe and will not betray freedom. I am thankful to you! I am thankful to all friends and partners of Ukraine - both from large states and from geographically smaller ones yet whose will is not inferior to the will of the largest. I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukrainians destroy evil! Due to the cruelty of history - after several unfortunate historic turns - our state was not mentioned for some time. Then they’ve been saying that Ukraine is somewhere next to Russia, or is even allegedly a part of it. We know that now they definitely know - Ukraine is the only state in the world that has the bravery to beat Russia. Beat on our land notwithstanding any of its threats. It is important that we make others fall in love with our Ukrainian indomitability. It is important that we are all a state that functions for the sake of Ukrainian interests and is reckoned with by everyone in the world. It is important that we are a democratic state that is strengthening its institutions even now, especially now - during such a devastating war. We applied to join the European Union and were granted candidacy with speed and under conditions unprecedented for any other state. This is our development. These are our friends, their help. These are our interests. This is Ukrainian speed - what we became capable of when we freed ourselves from illusions and achieved the greatest national unity in history. Glory to Ukraine! It is with the same speed that we should come to the beginning of negotiations regarding Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union. We will do everything we have to for this. We will synchronize the legislation of Ukraine with the law of the European Union. A plan for the implementation of all EU regulations and directives as part of the fulfillment of the Association Agreement with the European Union has also been formed. This is actually a joint task for us, for you, dear deputies, and for the Government of our country. And this corresponds to our new reality. The fact that we have transferred the process of European integration from the sphere of foreign policy to the sphere of domestic policy. This is where real work, real European integration, starts. Ukraine has always been Europe. Our values have always been European. Our state-building experience of different times is a European experience. And now we have come to the point where our state system is institutionally becoming Europe. We have started the process of de-oligarchization - a registry is being formed that is ready to put the oligarchs under the power of society. I have signed a decree on the creation of a competition commission for the selection of candidates for the High Council of Justice, and thanks to this and other steps, we will do everything to ensure that the fundamental judicial reform provides every Ukrainian with access to honest and competent justice. Today, the new Prosecutor General finalized the appointment of the new head of the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor&#x27;s Office with his first decision. And it is an honor for me to announce another very important step now. The European Union has the College of Europe in Bruges and Natolin, which are some of the most prestigious institutions of postgraduate education that prepare professionals to work in institutions of the EU and member states. We are establishing our College of Europe in Ukraine. A corresponding memorandum has already been signed between the Government of Ukraine and the College of Europe in Natolin. At the first stage, a faculty of European integration will be established in one of the Ukrainian higher education institutions, and later, on its basis, the College of Europe in the framework of the Presidential University will be established. And although I have been told that this will not be resolved in months, as I have been told many times on other issues, I know that the creation of our College of Europe will not take long. I&#x27;m sure it will start working shortly. We already have this experience - to turn into months what was supposed to take years and decades, and into weeks - what was supposed to take months. Such a College will become not only a professional basis for the European policy of Ukraine as a member of the EU, but also our contribution to the development of European institutions. This is what we, the citizens of Ukraine, are capable of. This is our statehood. We showed strength in battles and united the world with the best emotions that people have. We fight against the terror of the occupiers, we defend humanity for all nations. We guarantee that the borders of Europe will never again move further west than our eastern state border. And we make our state and public institutions advanced. And when today, on this Day of Ukrainian Statehood, here, in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, before the eyes of the entire Ukrainian people, I will honor strong people for strong deeds with the Cross of Combat Merit, I want all Ukrainians to feel: we are behind those who defend our country on the battlefield, and behind our backs - the backs of millions of Ukrainians living now - there are those who have been creating Ukrainian history, Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian character for centuries. We must be worthy of the height of our people, all its generations, and the thousand-year weight of our statehood. I congratulate you all on the holiday! I am thankful to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No one in the world invests in terrorism more than Russia, and this requires a legal response - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-28</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, we celebrated the Day of Ukrainian Statehood for the first time. And I was happy to see how many people perceived this holiday warmly, congratulated on it, smiled and were proud of Ukraine. It seems that we should have celebrated such a day for many, many years - it is so logical. But this holiday was established only last year. Well, it is forever now. During a solemn meeting in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, I presented combat awards to our warriors - &quot;Crosses of Combat Merit&quot;. In particular, to Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander of the Khortytsia Operational-Strategic Command, Major-General Andriy Kovalchuk, Brigadier-General Andriy Hnatov, Brigadier-General Mykhailo Drapaty, Colonels Yevhen Bulatsyk, Mykola Mishakin and Oleh Fedoriv, Lieutenant-Colonel Pavlo Rozlach, Majors Ruslan Maryshev and Denys Nokhrin, Captain Dmytro Berehovy, Senior Lieutenants Dmytro Linnyk and Anatoliy Tantsyura, Medical Service Lieutenant Yulia Holovna, Sergeant Pavlina Mykolayevych, Staff Sergeant Roman Palamarchuk, Junior Sergeant Oleksandr Rohachevsky, Senior Sailor Olena Zablotska and Private Serhiy Mishchenko. Thank you all for your service and performance in battles! Today, in the Mariyinsky Palace, I handed out the passports of the citizens of our state to young Ukrainians - boys and girls who were forced to leave their homes due to hostilities, young volunteers, winners of the All-Ukrainian Olympics, children of our warriors who defend Ukraine, children of those who gave life for the independence of the state. An inspiring ceremony that affirms the power of Ukrainian citizenship! The future of Ukraine is in such children, in their sincerity and intelligence. I am proud to be the President of such citizens. I had the honor to thank one of our greatest friends - Mr. President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda for the support and extremely important things that strengthened our defense. President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola - a principled friend of ours in European structures - addressed the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in a special format. There were important phone conversations. In the morning - with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. I thanked him for his prayers for Ukraine, for his wishes of victory and peace. In the evening, I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte - very meaningfully about our future cooperation. I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. We considered four issues. What can be said publicly now: we analyzed the current state of providing weapons to our defenders, the supply of aid from partners and, in general, the state of implementation of the Defense Plan of Ukraine, which was put into effect on February 24. Only in the first half of this day, and only in Kyiv, there were four air alarms. The Russian army launched missile attacks on the Kyiv region, Kropyvnytskyi, hit Mykolaiv, continued a series of strategically senseless and brutal onslaughts on Donbas... I thank each and every one who repels this terror. And I also want to thank the American senators who unanimously approved the resolution calling on the US Department of State to recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. You can take any day in Ukraine - today or any other after February 24 - to see that no one in the world invests in terrorism more than Russia. This really needs a legal response at the global level. And there is no rational reason why such a reaction should not occur, particularly in the United States. We continue to accumulate international humanitarian support. I am glad that Demna, the creative director of the Balenciaga fashion house, has become the new ambassador of the United24 state charity platform. He told me that the decision to become a United24 ambassador was related to his personal story, as he had experienced the trauma of being a refugee. Demna will help Ukraine in the direction of reconstruction. Let me remind you that Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolina, Liev Schreiber and Imagine Dragons have already become ambassadors of United24. We will do everything so that there is no indifference left in the world towards this terrible war that Russia has unleashed against our state and against the very idea of freedom. We will definitely win! Congratulations once again on the Day of Ukrainian Statehood! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our diplomats bring information about Russian attack on Olenivka to highest international level; Russia won&#x27;t be able to lie to anyone – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainian men and women! Dear all our defenders! I am returning from Odesa region. In particular, today I met with our heroes – soldiers of the Special Operations Forces. I thanked them for their service, awarded the best and emphasized that their main task is to ensure that the enemy did not have a single calm moment on this land. The land must burn under their feet. Every occupier who abuses Ukrainians, who tortures and kills, should know that there will be punishment for this. If some of the Russian killers hope that they will not be brought to justice, that they will hide somewhere, let them know – they will answer in any case. Geography, time, borders, walls will not stop a just retribution. I heard reports today about the attack of the occupiers on Olenivka, Donetsk region. It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war. More than 50 dead... When the defenders of Azovstal left the plant, the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross acted as guarantors of the life and health of our soldiers. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Security Service, the Main Intelligence Directorate and the representative of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine issued a joint statement addressing to the UN and the Red Cross as guarantors of those agreements regarding the defenders of Azovstal. I support this statement. Now the guarantors must react. They must protect the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war. And I add on my own: there should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. I am especially appealing to the United States of America – a solution is needed, needed now. Russia has proven with numerous terrorist attacks that it is the biggest source of terrorism in the world today. It&#x27;s a fact. Ukrainian diplomats brought the information about the Russian attack on Olenivka to the highest international level. The UN Security Council has been informed. All participants in international relations will know what really happened. Russia won&#x27;t be able to lie to anyone. The international community is also informed about all the details of our resistance to Russian hunger terror. Concrete work on the restoration of Ukrainian grain exports began today in Odesa. It&#x27;s important. It&#x27;s important not only from the point of view of the economic strength of our state, which is needed to withstand this war. It&#x27;s important for the world to withstand the pressure of the food crisis. The more Ukrainian grain is on the global market, the more stable the situation with our partners will be, and therefore our joint countermeasures against the terrorist state will be more effective. I emphasize – a terrorist state. I don&#x27;t want to make any forecast now – let&#x27;s see how the agreements on grain export will be implemented. The UN, Turkey and other international partners are responsible for the security side of this process. The Armed Forces of Ukraine do everything necessary to protect our coast. I want to say one more thing today. Russian terror is primarily aimed at breaking our inner strength. Russia cannot do anything to us on the battlefield. Our defenders are very strong. You and I should be just as strong. Our emotions, our common will to fight must be strong until our very victory. No matter what the occupiers do, no matter how they try to break our spirit, we must hold on, be mobilized and fully focused on what is necessary for our victory. If any of you feel that you cannot stand the evil that you see, think about how else you can personally help the defense of Ukraine. Help the Armed Forces! Tell the world the facts about Russian terror! And convince everyone you know in partner countries to increase aid to Ukraine. We will definitely win. But we have to come to that. We are all together. Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror! Eternal glory to each and every one who destroys these occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Recognition of Russia as terrorist state needed not as political gesture, but as effective defense of free world – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-30</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! During this day, our state received many signals from different countries condemning the Russian terrorist act in Olenivka. The world sees the truth. And I thank all our partners who are ready to join in establishing all the circumstances of this terrible execution of our prisoners. All evidence of this crime committed by the occupiers will be collected. Everyone is guilty – who approved, who organized, who blasted these people, who knew about it – they all will be found. But still, this is not enough now. There must be legal steps on the part of the world community against the terrorist state. Condemnation at the level of political rhetoric is not enough for this mass murder. What relationship can be with the terrorist after that? What kind of business can be done with such a country? Ukrainian diplomats and all friends of Ukraine abroad will increase their activity even more to track and destroy all those connections of the terrorist state with the free world, which Russia still uses. And formal legal recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, in particular, recognition by the United States Department of State, is needed not as a political gesture, but as an effective defense of the free world. This decision will automatically make it difficult for the terrorist state to exist, and will automatically cut various political and business ties that Russia would maintain otherwise. And all this will happen one hundred percent. It will have to be done – it&#x27;s only a matter of time and the format of making this decision. And the sooner it happens, the less evil Russia will have time to do. It is important to hear exactly the same motivation now for all our people who still remain in Donbas, in the areas of the fiercest fighting. There are hundreds of thousands of people, tens of thousands of children... Many of people refuse to leave... But it really needs to be done. This decision will still have to be made. Anyway! Believe me. And the sooner it is done, the more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill. Therefore, if you have the opportunity, please talk to those who still remain in the combat zones in Donbas. Please convince them that it is necessary to leave, especially if they are families with children. If you have the opportunity to help displaced people, do it. There is a government decision on mandatory evacuation from Donetsk region, everything is being organized. Full support, full assistance – both logistical and payments. We only need a decision from the people themselves, who have not yet made it for themselves. Go, we will help. We are not Russia. That is why every life is important for us. And we will use all available opportunities to save as many lives as possible and to limit Russian terror as much as possible. At this stage of the war, terror is the main weapon for Russia. And that is why the main task of every Ukrainian, every defender of freedom and humanity in the world is to do everything to isolate the terrorist state and to protect as many people as possible from Russian attacks. I am grateful to everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! To our heroes! Grateful to everyone who saves our people from this Russian terror! We will defeat everyone! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine and our people, our capabilities are more powerful than any Russian missiles - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-07-31</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today, one of the most brutal shellings of Mykolaiv and the region over the entire period of the full-scale war took place. Dozens of missiles and rockets... The occupiers hit residential buildings, schools, other social infrastructure, and industrial facilities. The Russian attack took the lives of Oleksiy Vadaturskyi and his wife Raisa, the founder of one of the largest Ukrainian agricultural companies &quot;Nibulon&quot;, the Hero of Ukraine. My sincere condolences to the relatives and friends of the Vadaturskyi couple. It is exactly such people, such companies, our Ukrainian south that have guaranteed the world&#x27;s food security. It has always been so. And it will be so again. The Russian terrorists should not even hope that they will be able to destroy the social and industrial potential of Ukraine and walk through the ruins. Ukraine and our people, our capabilities are definitely more powerful than any Russian missiles and shells. Now the Russian army is trying to strengthen its positions in the occupied areas of the south of our country, increasing activity in the relevant areas. Part of the Russian forces from their positions in the east are moved to the south - to the Kherson region and the Zaporizhzhia region... But this will not help them there. None of the Russian strikes goes unanswered by our military and intelligence officers. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready to respond to any new activity of the occupiers. And today I want to thank every resident of Mykolaiv for their indomitability, for protecting the city and the region. I also thank Nikopol, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih and the entire Dnipropetrovsk region, the strong people of Zaporizhzhia and the region, all Ukrainians of the Kherson region, everyone who defends the outskirts of Odesa and the region... Thank you for your courage! Strategically, Russia has no chance of winning this war. And it is necessary to hold on, so that even at the tactical levels, the terrorist state feels its defeat. We have to hold on in the south, in the east and everywhere. We have to hold on in defense, diplomacy and politics. To preserve our unity - and not only until the victory, but also after it, in order to qualitatively restore everything destroyed by the occupiers. I believe that we will do all this. I signed several important laws today, in particular the law on providing additional guarantees of protection to media representatives working in the areas of hostilities. This will strengthen the protection of our journalists. The law on ensuring the rights and freedoms of IDPs is eliminating bureaucratic barriers that limited assistance to people. The law on the protection of the civilian population in the event of emergency situations and hostilities. Also, the law that creates conditions for comprehensive thermal modernization of buildings and simplifies the process of restoring the residential sector damaged by the strikes of the occupiers. Important ratification laws, some other acts as well. We are preparing for a new week - as always, full of international activity. Already tomorrow there will be important negotiations with European partners. In a few days I will continue delivering speeches to the international community, communicating with different audiences - it is very important, in particular with the student audience. No matter what happens and no matter what the occupiers’ plans are, we must do our job - protect our state and take care of each other. The more effective we are in this - all of us, all citizens of Ukraine - the faster we will achieve victory. Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The power of the democratic world is well felt on the battlefield in Ukraine these weeks - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-01</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! The implementation of the Initiative on the export of Ukrainian grain and other agricultural products from our ports in the Black Sea began today. The first vessel carrying 26,000 tons of corn left the port of Odesa. As of now, it is too early to draw any conclusions and predict further events. But the port started working, the export traffic started, and this can be called the first positive signal that there is a chance to stop the spread of the food crisis in the world. Currently, everything depends on the implementation of the security parameters of the Initiative, which is the responsibility of the partners, primarily the United Nations and Turkey. We cannot have the illusions that Russia will simply refrain from trying to disrupt Ukrainian exports. Russia consistently provoked famine in the countries of Africa and Asia, which traditionally imported large volumes of Ukrainian food. And now - in conditions of extreme heat, as this year in Europe, the threat of a price crisis and a certain food shortage is also possible for some European countries. So, we’ll see how the agreements will work and whether there will really be security. 16 vessels are already waiting their turn for departure, and we are ready to make a proper contribution to the stabilization of the world food market. For our state, this is also of great benefit - and this is not only about billions of dollars in foreign exchange revenue. About half a million Ukrainians are involved in the cultivation of agricultural export crops, and if we add related industries, then this is plus a million jobs. That is why there is the appropriate state attention to the implementation of the export Initiative. Our people really need it. Today I spoke with President of France Emmanuel Macron, in particular about the restoration of our agricultural exports by sea. In general, the negotiations lasted one and a half hours and were very meaningful: relations in the defense sphere, first of all. A wide range of security issues - thank you for the assistance already given to Ukraine, which effectively protects us on the battlefield. We also discussed macro-financial support for our state - I asked Mr. President to help us unblock macro-financial aid, which has stalled in Europe. I want to remind all the leaders that it is 9 billion euros. These are not trifles for us, but important social things - these are our pensions, these are our salaries, support for IDPs, and therefore we expect appropriate decisions from specific government officials. Mr. President of France informed me about the results of his African tour - we are now strengthening this direction of our foreign policy. I invited President Macron to participate in the online summit of the Crimea Platform, which will take place shortly. Last year, we created the Crimea Platform and are developing this format – despite all the threats and tangible diplomatic opposition from Russia. During the years of occupation, Russia turned Crimea into a large military prison camp - and tens of thousands of people became its victims. Crimea became a bridgehead for attacks on the free territory of our country... The weak and insufficiently principled reaction to the occupation of Crimea in 2014 and in the following years became one of the prerequisites for the fact that Russian aggression managed to grow to such a scale. We will gradually restore justice regarding our Crimea. The situation on the battlefield has not undergone significant changes over the past day. Fierce battles continue in Donbas, in the Kharkiv region, the struggle for the south of our country continues... Ukrainian artillery and intelligence have already done a lot to reduce the fire potential of the occupiers - and it is tangible. Today I want to thank all our warriors who destroy Russian logistics, who destroy the occupiers&#x27; ammunition and who do not leave the occupiers a single safe place on our land. And I also want to thank our partners now - everyone who supplies Ukraine with modern and effective artillery and MLRS. The power of the democratic world is well felt on the battlefield in Ukraine these weeks. And today, another conversation took place in the format Ukraine - United States - three on three - Andriy Yermak and Jacob Sullivan, Dmytro Kuleba and Antony Blinken, Valerii Zaluzhny and Mark Milley. This is our continuous format, which has already allowed us to make a fundamental contribution to the protection of the entire free world. We’ve coordinated next steps in support of Ukraine. Eternal glory to everyone who fights for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every hryvnia earned by our agricultural workers and restored international relations will contribute to the strengthening of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-02</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the first vessel with Ukrainian grain arrived at the Bosphorus, passing through a special corridor in the Black Sea, which was agreed upon to unblock our ports. Our goal now is to have regularity: so that when one ship leaves the port, there are other ships as well - both those loading and those approaching the port. Continuity and regularity is the necessary principle. All consumers of our agricultural products need it. Much has already been said about why it is important to restore Ukrainian agricultural exports. I will add just one detail now. Export this year is needed so that our farmers and agricultural companies have sufficient resources for next year&#x27;s sowing. This is a matter of food security for our country as well - we are now ensuring next year. Russia provoked the food crisis in order to use the supply of wheat, corn, oil as a weapon... Just as it is already doing with gas and crude oil. Russia creates a deficit, instigates the increase in prices, and when this provokes social unrest, it demands political concessions. It should not work with food. Of course, we understand who we are dealing with. And in Russia, they understand that they are losing one of the opportunities to terrorize the world. But when the world is united, when partners fulfill their commitments, the necessary result can be achieved. Let&#x27;s see how the grain initiative will work in the coming days. And I want everyone in Ukraine to realize this despite the disinformation campaign about the grain initiative, which is being spread by the enemies of our state... Every hryvnia earned by our agricultural workers and all the restored international ties of Ukraine will contribute to the strengthening of our state. I spoke today with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Of course, the key theme is the defense support of our struggle for freedom, this is an interaction that we must strengthen constantly for our common interests. OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Zbigniew Rau was in Kyiv today - I thanked him for the support. In negotiations with both Mr. Stoltenberg and Mr. Rau, I paid special attention to the issue of our prisoners of war kept by Russia. In particular, this also applies to the Russian terrorist attack in Olenivka, which must become an ultimate argument for all civilized countries of the world to officially recognize Russia as a terrorist state. What else is needed for this? Isn&#x27;t this a sufficiently brutal and obvious act of terrorism for the relevant decisions to recognize Russia as a terrorist state to be made in the major capitals of the world? Of course, the occupiers receive a fundamental response to all their crimes on the battlefield. In this context, today I want to thank President of the United States Biden and the entire American people for the new package of defense support for Ukraine. The word &quot;HIMARS&quot; has become almost synonymous with the word &quot;justice&quot; for our country, and the Ukrainian defense forces will do everything to ensure that the occupiers experience more and more painful losses every week thanks to these very effective systems. Yes, indeed, we still cannot completely break the advantage of the Russian army in artillery and in manpower, and this is very tangible in the battles, especially in Donbas - Pisky, Avdiivka, other directions. It&#x27;s just hell there. It can&#x27;t even be described in words... And every Ukrainian must always be grateful to our warriors who defend Ukrainian positions there despite the terrorists&#x27; significant fire superiority. But every day our diplomats and all other representatives of our state do everything possible and everything impossible to get the weapons that will ultimately help Ukraine stop this horde and to convince everyone who still has doubts about the supplies. Today I also thank these people - each and every one who ensures the supply of weapons, who promotes the necessary decisions in partner states, who literally lives in these arms negotiations. We also have new decisions to strengthen sanctions against Russia for the war - the United States and Canada have expanded the list of individuals and legal entities against whom restrictions have been applied. This is the right way, and it is necessary for the European Union to fill in the sanctions pause as soon as possible by adopting a new package of sanctions against the terrorist state. We will work on this in the coming weeks. In the evening, I signed decrees awarding our defenders. 167 warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 32 of them posthumously. Another decree awarded 16 intelligence officers, 1 of them posthumously. Also - 122 employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, 2 - posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who fight for independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world must make a choice: an end to Russian atrocities or more explosions of Russian bombs - address by the President of Ukraine to students and lecturers of Australian universities</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-03</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mrs. Rector of the Australian National University! Dear lecturers! Dear students! I know that a total of 20 universities in Australia are currently participating in the broadcast. I am grateful for this opportunity to speak with you. Today is the 161st day of the full-scale war launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Every day, the world is shocked by new reports about new Russian crimes. This should not become usual for the world. Because it will mean that the world has come to terms. A lot of people worried and maybe still worry about the fact that it is necessary to act delicately and not to anger Russia. Regarding Russia being able to &quot;save face&quot;. By now it should be obvious to everyone - all this is of no importance. It is impossible to anger those who are mad. It is impossible to save face for someone who does not want it. The Russian Federation has been openly demonstrating this to all states for 161 days in a row. Now it is important not to forget any of them. The world always talks about Russia&#x27;s actions only in the context of their latest, so to speak, &quot;current&quot; atrocity. Now the world must finally put everything together and realize... He who wants to save face does not erase peaceful cities and villages from the face of the Earth. Does not fire at them with MLRS every day and every night. Does not shoot at residential buildings with cruise missiles. Does not fire cluster munitions or phosphorus bombs at residential areas. Does not fire missiles at the railway station, for example, in the city of Kramatorsk, where hundreds of people were simply waiting for evacuation. Does not fire missiles at Vinnytsia downtown where hundreds of people were just walking. Does not fire missiles at the shopping mall in Kremenchuk, where hundreds of people were buying food or stuff. Does not drop bombs on maternity hospitals and hospitals. Kindergartens, schools and universities. Museums, theaters, churches. Does not direct artillery against cemeteries and does not fire missiles at the memorial complex for the victims of the Holocaust - Babyn Yar. He who wants to save face does not commit thousands of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Does not organize mass executions of civilians. Does not handcuff civilians, does not put them on their knees and does not kill them with a shot in the back of the head. Does not rape women in front of their children and children in front of their mothers. He who wants to save face does not organize blockades of the occupied cities. Does not leave thousands of people without food and drinking water. Does not leave thousands of seriously ill patients without the necessary daily medications. Does not leave people without light, without heating, without connection, without the slightest hope. Does not disrupt humanitarian corridors. Does not take people to forced labor. Does not kidnap children, separating families. Does not leave behind dozens of mass graves. He who wants to save face does not seize nuclear power plants, does not fire at power units with tanks. Does not threaten the world with a nuclear strike and nuclear war. Does not threaten to create an energy crisis. Does not block ports and ships with grain, creating a threat of mass famine on the planet. And after signing the document on the unblocking of ports and free passage of ships, does not fire missiles at the seaport the day after signing! He who wants to save face does not bring mobile crematoria to burn corpses, to conceal his own atrocities and losses. Does not treat his own soldiers like cannon fodder. Does not treat prisoners of war worse than animals, does not torture, does not organize mass executions, atrocities, terrorist attacks. He who has lost his mind, heart, conscience, dignity and, in general, everything human, does not seek to save face. At least because he lost it a long time ago. Today&#x27;s Russia lost its face a long time ago. It did not happen yesterday, not the day before yesterday, and not last week. This was simply confirmed once again. Once again, the world saw what was hiding under the mask of a supposed peacemaker, which Russia tried to wear for many years. There is another mask. With slits for eyes and mouth. A mask worn by terrorists. And the only difference between terrorists and Russia is that the first take responsibility for their actions, while Russia does not have the courage to do so and has the audacity to blame others for its crimes. Other countries and the whole world. And now this world faces a choice. Long overdue, not convenient for someone, unpleasant, and for someone - inevitable. You can&#x27;t hide from it, you can&#x27;t come off unscathed, you can&#x27;t let it slide. During the 161 days of the full-scale war in Europe, humanity passed 161 points of no return. For many countries, the time has come when their own interests must yield to the interests of the planet. Because otherwise, both the first and the second will be under threat due to the actions of the world terrorist. Any trade, business, other forms of cooperation with Russia today, first of all, bring not probable benefits to some but probable death to others. Political, economic, energy or any other expediency is equal to the lives of thousands of people today. Who are killed by Russian weapons. The world must make a choice. The UN must make a choice. The UN Security Council must make a choice. The International Committee of the Red Cross must make a choice. The OSCE must make a choice. EU countries must make a choice. NATO countries must make a choice. The G7 and G20 countries must make a choice. The US must make a choice and take this important step. Recognize Russia as a sponsor of terrorism. This time has come. Long ago. The global countdown has started. And then there are only 2 options. Determination, and therefore an end to the crimes and atrocities of Russia, or – more bomb explosions from these terrorists. I know that many Australians send financial aid to our country, donate medications, volunteer in hospitals, ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and fight on the frontline. So I urge you to continue helping us, helping Ukraine, including in the classrooms. Defending the truth and debunking the myths that the Russian propaganda machine has so masterfully learned to fabricate. I am extremely grateful to the government of Anthony Albanese, just as to the previous Australian government, for the systematic support of our state. Which includes large-scale military and humanitarian aid, sanctions against Russian and Belarusian legal entities and individuals, abolition of tariffs on Ukrainian goods, provision of coal for our energy industry. Today, your country provides the largest military aid to Ukraine among non-NATO countries. We would appreciate your continued assistance. The war is not over. And today, more than ever, we need the support of all civilized countries, together with which we will definitely stop and defeat evil. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The fragility of freedom can be protected only by joint actions, there must be an effective architecture of global security - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-03</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! These days, in our information space and in social networks, there are a lot of reports about conflict situations and threats that exist in other geographies. First - the Balkans, then - Taiwan, now it may be the Caucasus... All these situations seem different, although they are united by one factor, namely: the global security architecture did not work. If it worked, there wouldn&#x27;t be all these conflicts. And this is actually what Ukraine has been drawing attention to not only for 161 days since the start of the full-scale war, but for years. Since Russia has completely ignored international law, the interests of humanity as such. 2014 became a turning point. Then, in quite obvious situations - with Crimea, with Donbas, with the downed Malaysian Boeing - Russia avoided immediate and tangible responsibility, preserved business and political ties with the world... And now many in global relations believe that they will manage to do so as well. That is why Ukrainians are now doing a very important thing for everyone in the world. Our people united the free world not just around their struggle for freedom, but around understanding how fragile our freedom is. The freedom of every nation in Europe and in other parts of the world. This fragility can only be protected by joint action, and for this to work in the long term, there must be an effective global security architecture that ensures that no state can ever again resort to terror against another state. At the system level, at the level of global institutions, this is exactly what we are currently working for - both the Ukrainian state and all our partners. Today I spoke with the student community of Australia. More than 20 universities, as well as the interest of Australia&#x27;s leading media, politicians. I called on all our Australian friends to help us in the information war and spread the truth about Ukrainian defense and Russian terror as much as possible. It is necessary to solve an extremely important national task: the Ukrainian point of view should be seen and heard in those parts of the world where Russian propaganda is still very loud. This applies to the Pacific region, the countries of South and East Asia, the Arab world, Africa and Latin America. And that is why information support is needed from all our people and all friends abroad whose voice can be heard. Today I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia who visited Ukraine. I thanked him for starting the visit with the topic of restoring Ukraine. In the Zhytomyr region, in the framework of our Fast Recovery Plan, we will begin the construction of the first kindergarten out of fifteen objects that have been proposed to the Estonian Government for help in the reconstruction of the region. This is extremely important right now - when displaced people are returning home. Estonia is one of those countries that started helping us even before February 24 and whose support has become extremely important. Ukraine will always remember this. Switzerland has today joined the European Union&#x27;s seventh package of sanctions - and I am grateful for that. When such a country does not remain neutral in the protection of values and human morality, it is a very important signal for the whole world. Now it is felt that Russia has begun to realize the inevitability of being recognized as a terrorist state. After all that the Russian army and allegedly private Russian military companies have done, no other terrorist organization in the world can claim primacy in terror. Russia is definitely number one among terrorists. And this definitely deserves legal consequences, in particular, in the decisions of the United States and other world actors. And precisely because of this, a new propaganda activity started in Moscow. They suddenly decided to define &quot;Azov&quot; as terrorists, although when a terrorist state does this, it is obviously absurd. They are activating various emissaries with theses that the terrorist state allegedly wants negotiations... If Russia really wanted the end of the war, it would not accumulate its reserves in the south of Ukraine now and would not create mass graves of murdered innocent people on Ukrainian territory. Well, in general, it is simply disgusting when former leaders of powerful states with European values work for Russia, which is fighting against these values. Therefore, we need to fight, we need to beat terrorists on our land, we need to spread information about Ukrainian interests and achieve success and victories for Ukraine. Each and every one at their own level - both Ukrainians and partners. Terror can be stopped only by a joint indomitable force. I signed a new decree on awarding our warriors. 194 combatants were awarded state awards. 28 of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by terrorists! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>There can be no condition under which any Russian attack on Ukraine becomes justified - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-04</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today, Russian terrorists once again fired at Toretsk, Donetsk region, hitting public transport stop. Eight people died, three children are among those injured. Residential buildings were damaged by projectile fragments and the blast wave - those are ordinary high-rise buildings. St. Panteleimon Church was also damaged, the priest was wounded. It was a deliberate strike by the occupiers, another act of terror – cynical and calculated. They knew where they were hitting, and they obviously wanted people to get hurt. However, we do not see clear and timely reports from some international organizations regarding this and thousands of other crimes committed by Russian terrorists. We saw today a completely different report from Amnesty International, which unfortunately tries to amnesty the terrorist state and shift the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim. There cannot be - even hypothetically - any condition under which any Russian attack on Ukraine becomes justified. Aggression against our state is unprovoked, invasive and openly terroristic. And if someone makes a report in which the victim and the aggressor are allegedly the same in something, if some data about the victim is analyzed and what the aggressor was doing at that time is ignored, this cannot be tolerated. Almost 200 religious buildings alone - temples and prayer houses of various denominations - were damaged or destroyed by Russian strikes. Almost 900 medical facilities. Over 2,200 educational institutions. Dozens of universities, hundreds of schools and kindergartens. The occupiers repeatedly deliberately fired artillery and mortars at people queuing for water, at evacuation buses, and repeatedly at public transport stops. The Russian army did not even refrain from striking at the memorials to the victims of the Holocaust, at the cemeteries... At the camp with prisoners of war in Olenivka. And there are no reports about it for some reason. This is immoral selectivity. Anyone who amnesties Russia and who artificially creates such an informational context that some attacks by terrorists are supposedly justified or supposedly understandable, cannot but realize that it helps the terrorists. And if you provide manipulative reports, then you share the responsibility for the death of people with them. Every day we expand the possibilities of our foreign policy - formal and informal. I spoke today with representatives of the African media - from Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ghana. African countries can be affected very seriously by the destabilization of world markets and global relations provoked by Russia, in particular due to the food crisis. At the same time, in Africa there is a shortage of true information about the Russian war against our country and a surplus of Russian propaganda. We’ll do everything to change this balance. Negotiations with the President of Guinea-Bissau took place for the first time in the history of our bilateral relations. I noted that Ukraine is ready to be a guarantor of food security for African countries. We discussed the support for our state in international organizations. Tomorrow there will be new negotiations with a leader of an African country, and in general, only recently we started proper communication with eight leaders of African states. Every day and in various ways, I remind some leaders of the European Union that Ukrainian pensioners, our displaced persons, our teachers and other people who depend on budget payments cannot be held hostage to their indecision or bureaucracy. 8 billion euros for Ukraine are currently suspended. And such an artificial delay of macro-financial assistance to our state is either a crime or a mistake, and it is difficult to say which is worse in such conditions of a full-scale war. I don&#x27;t want to name the European country that is slowing it down now. Let&#x27;s believe that this is still a mistake and that it will be corrected. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov reported on the current provision of troops with equipment and ammunition. Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, Head of the Security Service Malyuk, Minister of Internal Affairs Monastyrskyi also delivered reports. We analyzed the situation in the most acute areas of the frontline, in particular in the Donetsk region. Particular attention was paid to the state of implementation of the previous decisions of the Staff, all of them must be implemented by 100%. I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 192 combatants were awarded state awards, six of them posthumously. In total, more than 25,500 of our defenders have already been awarded for bravery and effectiveness in battles since February 24. More than 4 thousand - posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to everyone who fights against Russian terrorists! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The more our grain will be on the global market, the smaller will be the harvest of political chaos – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-05</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Three vessels with grain for export left our ports today – from Odesa and Chornomorsk. Almost 60,000 tonnes of corn are on board, which are expected by consumers in Turkey, the UK, and Ireland. The first new vessel since February 24 is heading to the port of Chornomorsk for loading. The main thing now is the constant increase in exports. Every adequate world player is interested in this. The more our grain will be on the global market, the smaller will be the harvest of political chaos in countries, primarily in Africa and Asia, but not only there. We must remember that this year the demand for imported food in Europe is much higher than expected. European harvests are smaller because of the heat. But the Ukrainian harvest of grain and oilseeds will most likely meet the forecasts – more than 65 million tonnes are expected. Therefore, if the partners do their part of the obligations under the Grain Initiative, the security part, and do not allow new Russian provocations in relation to our exports, then the food crisis, which has been so threatening to the world, can be overcome. But the situation on the energy market, and especially for European consumers, continues to be very dangerous due to Russia&#x27;s cynical and worked out well gas blackmail. Instead of supplying gas to the territory of Europe in accordance with the contracts, Russia even simply burns it – and this is happening more than one week. Why does it do this? So that prices in Europe rise even more, so that ordinary Europeans suffer even more and so that it will be even more difficult for everyone on the continent to prepare for winter. This is a manifestation of Russia&#x27;s deliberate anti-European policy, anti-human policy and the effect of the old mistakes of Europeans who did not want to see that Gazprom, Russian gas pipelines bypassing Ukraine are the same weapons for Russia as tanks and artillery, and each of us, each in Europe is a target for them. And we all have to defend ourselves now. Together to prepare for the new heating season. Together to respond to any provocations of Russia in the energy sector. Together to develop sanctions in response to Russian blackmail and terror. Today, the occupiers created another extremely risky situation for everyone in Europe – they fired at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, twice in one day. This is the largest nuclear power plant on our continent. And any shelling of this facility is an open, brazen crime, an act of terror. Russia should bear responsibility for the very fact of creating a threat to the nuclear power plant. And this is not only another argument in favor of recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. This is an argument in favor of applying tough sanctions against the entire Russian nuclear industry – from Rosatom to all related companies and individuals. This is purely a matter of safety. The one who creates nuclear threats to other nations is definitely not capable of using nuclear technologies safely. Today I held a meeting devoted to the sanctions policy, confiscation of Russian assets. As government officials reported, assets worth UAH 28 billion have already been forcibly seized in Ukraine. This work continues. More than 900 facilities belonging to the Russian state are proposed to be confiscated. And if we evaluate the property package not only of the terrorist state, but also of its residents, then this are 36,000 items for seizure. All this will be sent to compensate for the damages that Russia causes through war and terror. I also heard the results of the work of the group on the development and implementation of the international compensation mechanism and confiscation of Russian assets abroad. All our partners are actively working on this – in Europe, in the United States. Work on bills that will expand the possibilities for the confiscation of Russian assets for Ukraine is underway. And Donbas burned out by Russian strikes, the abuse of the occupiers over Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, the shelling of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, Kyiv region, Zhytomyr region, Odesa region and other regions of Ukraine are what Russia will surely pay for: both politically and financially, and with its own future, which Russia is losing with every strike on our territory. I spoke today with the President of Malawi. It is another African state, the ninth country, which Ukraine is in contact with for the first time at the highest level in the entire history of our independence. I assured Mr. President that Ukraine will make every effort so that every country interested in our agricultural products can meet its consumption needs. We also discussed other issues of stability and our cooperation in international organizations. I also signed a decree awarding our soldiers. A total of 192 combatants were given state awards, 18 of them, unfortunately, posthumously. Eternal gratitude to all who is fighting for our great state! Thank you, great people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are doing everything to get yet more effective and modern weapons – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-06</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I will brief you on the past week. First of all, I want to thank all our soldiers, who are extremely bravely - and in the hottest points of the frontline, with simply superhuman efforts – holding back the enemy. The Russian army will not change its tactics. The occupiers know that they will lose to the Ukrainians in direct struggle, they are inferior in skill, and that is why the enemy is counting on artillery and indiscriminate shelling. They try to destroy everything in front of them and enter the ruins. And I am grateful to everyone who, even in such conditions, still is containing the occupiers in Donbas, in Kharkiv region, in the Mykolaiv direction – wherever the confrontation is the most acute. During this week, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our intelligence have achieved powerful results in destroying the logistics of the Russian army, the rear bases of the occupiers. And every strike on the enemy&#x27;s ammunition depots, on their command posts, on accumulations of Russian equipment saves the lives of all of us, the lives of Ukrainian military and civilians. Of course, I thank the partners – everyone who supplies Ukraine with the necessary weapons. In particular, another package of support from the United States was approved this week, which also includes ammunition for the HIMARS systems. Thank you very much. All of them are used as accurately and beneficially as possible for the overall strategy of our defense. We are doing everything to get yet more effective and modern weapons. It was possible to restore the sea export of Ukrainian agricultural products. Our ports on the Black Sea are operating again. And although it is still too early to give general assessments of the process, we can still say that it is positive both for our state and for all our partners. However, the key security risk has not yet been removed. The threat of Russian provocations and terrorist attacks remains. Everyone should be aware of this. But if the partners fulfill their part of the commitment and guarantee the security of the supply, it will really solve the global food crisis. And we must not forget that the restoration of our sea exports was made possible primarily thanks to our soldiers – all those who defend Odesa and secured the liberation of Snake Island. These are simply heroes. During the week, opportunities for Ukraine in the African direction were significantly expanded. There were new contacts with state leaders and communication with journalists. I will continue this work next week – another series of negotiations is planned. Unfortunately, we have a significant worsening of the situation around the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Russian terrorists became the first in the world to use a nuclear plant for terror. The biggest in Europe! We will draw the world&#x27;s attention to this and insist on new sanctions against Russia for creating such a global threat. And despite the fact that the Russian shelling of the nuclear plant is one of the most dangerous crimes against Ukrainians and all Europeans, against the right to life of every person, for some reason there is no report or even a simple notification from Amnesty International about it. A very eloquent silence, which once again indicates the manipulative selectivity of this organization. This week there are new sanction steps from Canada and the United States. Switzerland made an important decision regarding support for the seventh EU sanctions package. The general tendency to strengthen sanctions remains unchanged and will continue increasing the price for this terror, terror against our people, for the terrorist state. I want to thank everyone who develops our UNITED24 public charity platform, and all the ambassadors of this platform – Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolinia, Liev Schreiber, the band Imagine Dragons, Demna. This week we summed up the three-month results of work the UNITED24 platform. More than UAH 6 billion were raised in contributions for reconstruction, equipment for hospitals, for the purchase of ambulances – dozens of ambulances were purchased. There is already the first helicopter bought using the funds raised by UNITED24. It will be used to rescue the wounded. It was possible to attract help from more than a hundred countries. One of the most important areas for August and September is the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan. What needs to be done in the territory liberated from the enemy to give people conditions for a normal life and to prepare for the autumn and winter season. In total, 1,060 settlements have already been liberated, and the absolute majority of them require significant restoration work, demining, and the construction of social facilities. And I thank all our partners who joined the relevant work. In particular, this week the delegation of Estonia visited the districts of Zhytomyr region, which the country is helping with recovery. Estonia was the first within the Fast Recovery Plan to choose objects for financing. We work with diplomats and companies in all other areas that need support and restoration. We believe in our defenders! We help the defense! Let&#x27;s remain united and do everything for the victory of Ukraine! It will be! Eternal glory to our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>A principled response from the international community to the Russian strikes at the Zaporizhzhia NPP is needed right now - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-07</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is the Day of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and now I want to once again congratulate all military pilots and also all defenders of our skies on a professional holiday. We are all proud of you and wish you so many victories that the Russian soldiers are simply afraid of even the very thought of our Ukrainian sky. This morning, I congratulated the fighters and commanders of the Air Force, handed out state awards to the best warriors. I handed over the &quot;Golden Star&quot; orders to the wives of the fallen Heroes of Ukraine - Lieutenant colonel Eduard Vahorovsky and Major Dmytro Kolomiyets. They gave their lives saving their brothers and protecting our state. Eternal memory and gratitude to the Heroes! I spoke today with President of the European Council Charles Michel. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about the threat that Russia created by striking at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. There is no such nation in the world that can feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant. God forbid, if something irreparable happens, no one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination. Therefore, a principled response of the international community to these Russian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia NPP - the largest in Europe - is needed right now. The situation in Donbas remains very difficult. Our army is doing everything possible to stop the Russian terror and inflict the greatest possible losses on the occupiers. Avdiivka, Pisky, Maryinka, Bakhmut and other hot areas in the Donetsk region take the main efforts and, unfortunately, many lives. It is also difficult in the Kharkiv region, in the south of our country, where the occupiers are trying to concentrate their forces. The key thing now, just as before, is weapons for our defense, weapons from partners. Every day without any pauses, we work to increase the supply of weapons, to send more powerful and long-range systems to the front. And next week we expect news from partners regarding support packages. Good news. In this summer time, every week there are more and more reports that the occupiers are preparing for pseudo-referendums in the occupied areas of the south of our country. I want to say a very simple thing: everyone who helps the occupiers in any way realize their intention will be held accountable. They will bear responsibility to Ukraine. The position of our state remains the same: we will not give up anything of ours, and if the occupiers follow the path of these pseudo-referendums, they will close for themselves any possibility of negotiations with Ukraine and the free world, which the Russian side will definitely need in a certain moment. Next week, I will continue the practice of political appeals to representatives of partner states and nations who defend freedom together with us. A number of important negotiations are also planned - and not only with current politicians. As before, Ukraine will do everything to make our struggle and Ukrainian needs known in all countries of the world and in all audiences - even those who usually do not follow political life. In particular, American actress Jessica Chastain arrived in Kyiv today. She visited &quot;Okhmatdyt&quot; and saw with her own eyes the consequences of the Russian occupation in Irpin, Kyiv region. Her story about our war will definitely be heard. We are preparing an important humanitarian event. And I am grateful to all friends of Ukraine abroad and to everyone who helps expand our ties in the world. We are doing everything to win, everything to protect our country. I wish all of us Ukrainians a fruitful new week! Glory to our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>After this Russian war against Ukraine, neither smoldering nor frozen conflict should remain - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-08</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! These days, people remember the Russian war against Georgia in 2008. There are many talks about the prerequisites of that war, about its consequences. About how that year&#x27;s refusal to provide Ukraine and Georgia with a NATO Membership Action Plan increased the audacity of the Russian leadership. But still, the war of that time has not yet become history, has not completely receded into the past. Therefore, it is necessary to talk more about what can be done than about what happened. The challenges of that time are still very relevant today. And not only because the threat of further Russian aggression in this part of the Caucasus still exists, even though it is frozen. Only now has the world begun to realize the need for real, effective tools to prevent such aggressions and to bring any aggressors to justice. 2008, 2014, 2022 - the wars that started in these years have a different scale and nature, but there is one meaning of what happened: regional and global security mechanisms did not work. That is why the principle of prevention, which we have been insisting on for a very long time even before February 24, is so necessary in international relations. If it is already clear that a state is preparing aggression - unjust, unprovoked, illegal, then the world&#x27;s reaction to its preparation should be the same as to the aggression that happened. It is necessary to act to prevent war, not to wait for strikes and victims. After this Russian war against Ukraine, neither smoldering nor frozen conflict should remain. This is an important conclusion. Ukraine must return everything that Russia temporarily seized, and the aggressor state must be punished for the crime of aggression. And this is important not only for justice. Only the obvious defeat of the aggressor, their loss of everything captured and their international legal responsibility for aggression are safeguards against any war. This is what our diplomats, the Office, government officials and absolutely everyone involved in organizing a global political, economic and legal response to Russian aggression are working on. By protecting our state, we automatically protect everyone who has already been threatened or may still be threatened by a terrorist state. And, of course, the greatest contribution is now made by the military - all Ukrainian heroes who are breaking the Russian terrorist machine on the battlefield. Today I especially want to thank the Ukrainian anti-aircraft fighters of the Air Command &quot;Center&quot; and Air Command &quot;South&quot; for the successful destruction of Russian missiles that were launched from the Black Sea in the morning. The four downed Kalibrs are dozens of Ukrainian lives saved. Our military also managed to shoot down some of the missiles that Russian terrorists launched at Ukraine in the afternoon and in the evening. Yes, our military means are still not enough to guarantee the downing of all Russian missiles. And we will do everything to ensure that such means appear in our country. But even now, the skill of our heroes makes it possible, at least partially, to reduce the Russian terrorist threat. I am grateful to everyone who ensures that! We are actively informing the world about Russian nuclear blackmail - about shelling and mining of the Zaporizhzhia NPP facilities. There are already appropriate reactions from the international community. But it is necessary to speed up actions in response. Russia will not pay attention to words and concerns. New sanctions are needed against the terrorist state and the entire Russian nuclear industry for creating the threat of a nuclear disaster. The world should not forget about Chornobyl and remember that the Zaporizhzhia NPP is the largest in Europe. The Chornobyl disaster is an explosion in one reactor, the Zaporizhzhia NPP is six power units. I held negotiations with the President of Botswana - the first in the history of our bilateral relations. We discussed cooperation within the UN and other international organizations. I expressed gratitude for the condemnation of Russian aggression and assured Mr. President that Ukraine is ready to continue being the guarantor of world food security. Implementation of the grain export initiative continues - today, for the first time since February 24, a loaded ship left the Pivdennyi port. Currently, there is every chance to ensure the rhythmic nature of such exports. However, as in previous days, the key thing is the ability of the partners to prevent any attempts by Russia to disrupt exports and exacerbate the global food crisis again. And I want to remind all our agrarians, all workers of our ports, all those involved in related industries and all those who comment on this that sea export was restored primarily thanks to our warriors who protected the relevant water area: our intelligence, our special operations forces and &quot;Alpha&quot; of the Security Service of Ukraine, gunners, the Navy, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, border guards and our entire heroic army that defends the state. A new package of American support for Ukraine in the amount of one billion dollars was announced today. These are, in particular, rockets for HIMARS, ammunition for artillery and many other really useful things. I am grateful to President Biden and the people of the United States for this support, 100% of which is used to protect freedom, our common freedom. I signed a new decree on awarding combatants. 183 of our defenders were awarded state awards, four of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Gratitude to everyone who fights for the country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russian war against Ukraine and the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with it - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-09</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, there is a lot of attention to the topic of Crimea. And rightly so. Because Crimea is Ukrainian, and we will never give it up. We will not forget that the Russian war against Ukraine began with the occupation of Crimea. Russia has turned our peninsula, which has always been and will be one of the best places in Europe, into one of the most dangerous places in Europe. Russia brought large-scale repression, environmental problems, economic hopelessness and war to Crimea. War. Perhaps historians will one day determine how many people were killed as a result of Russia&#x27;s use of Crimea for terror. Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? From Ukraine and Georgia to Syria and more remote regions. The presence of Russian occupiers in Crimea is a threat to the entire Europe and to global stability. The Black Sea region cannot be safe as long as Crimea is occupied. There will be no stable and lasting peace in many countries on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea as long as Russia is able to use our peninsula as its military base. This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea - with its liberation. Today it is impossible to say when this will happen. But we are constantly adding the necessary components to the formula of liberation of Crimea. We launched the Crimea Platform - a key diplomatic platform for the work on the liberation of Crimea. The Crimea Platform will work this year as well. We are already preparing for this summit. The Crimean topic sounds on all international platforms where the Russian war against our state is discussed. The history of the global response to Russia&#x27;s seizure of Crimea, or rather the lack of such a response, is now one of the best arguments for strengthening sanctions against Russia. The world is beginning to recognize that it made a mistake in 2014 when it decided not to respond with full force to Russia&#x27;s first aggressive steps. And, of course, we pay due attention to the struggle for rights and historical justice for the indigenous peoples of Ukraine - the Crimean Tatar people, Karaites and Krymchaks. Today, on the International Day of the World&#x27;s Indigenous Peoples, we really have something to say. Last summer, the fundamental law on indigenous peoples of Ukraine was adopted. This law recognizes the rights of indigenous peoples and representative bodies of indigenous peoples. Ukraine is a multinational state. Various national communities have been living on our land for centuries. But most of them have experience of state formation outside of Ukraine. Our state is native to peoples whose national cultures and aspirations were formed in Crimea. Therefore, when we are working for the liberation of the peninsula, we are fighting for the restoration of the territorial integrity of our state and for the return of home to the indigenous peoples of Ukraine. I believe that it will be so. I know that we will return to the Ukrainian Crimea. And I am grateful to all our partners and international organizations that help us in this. It is too early to disclose all the details, but this year the work of the Crimea Platform will be no less important and representative than last year, when its first summit was held in Kyiv. The format will be different, but the value will be even greater. We are preparing new solutions for the protection and assistance in the realization of the rights of the indigenous peoples of Ukraine. We are also preparing programs for the economic recovery of our Crimea after its liberation from the occupiers. Well, the main thing is to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and everyone who is fighting to liberate our land and repel the Russian colonial invasion. From the Kharkiv region to Kherson, from Donetsk to Enerhodar, from Stanytsia Luhanska to Yalta, from Berdyansk to Novofedorivka - these are all parts of our country, this is Ukraine, which will be completely free. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our defenders. 182 combatants were awarded state awards. The total number of awarded Ukrainian warriors has already exceeded 26,000 since February 24. I thank everyone who defends Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The more losses the occupiers suffer, the sooner we will be able to liberate our land - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-10</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! At the end of this difficult 168th day of our defense, a few things should be said. First. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and our law enforcement agencies will not leave today&#x27;s Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered. 13 people died as a result of the occupiers&#x27; attack on Marhanets&#x27;. More than ten are wounded, five are in grave condition. Russian troops were striking with &quot;Grads&quot;. This regular manifestation of Russian terror, just as the attacks on Mykolaiv and Kharkiv, once again proves that it is necessary to increase military aid to Ukraine. The more powerful our weapons are and the greater the range of their use is, the sooner this cruel war will end. And that&#x27;s the second thing I wanted to say today. This is a question that worries absolutely everyone: when will the war end? Someone says - months, someone - a year, someone - even more. But the question of time actually directly depends on the question of the losses that Russia will suffer. The more losses the occupiers suffer, the sooner we will be able to liberate our land and guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s security. This is what everyone who defends our state and helps Ukraine should think about: how to inflict the greatest possible losses on the occupiers so that the time of the war gets shorter. If almost 43,000 dead Russian soldiers do not convince the Russian leadership that they need to find a way out of the war, then more fighting is needed, more results are needed to convince. In just one day, the occupiers lost ten combat aircraft: nine in Crimea and one more in the direction of Zaporizhzhia. The occupiers also suffer new losses of armored vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, logistics routes... A conference at the level of defense ministers of Ukraine&#x27;s partner states begins tomorrow in Copenhagen. Further support for our state in this war, including weapons, will be discussed. I am grateful to all our partners who understand that only by ensuring Russia&#x27;s defeat on the battlefield, only by Russian losses - military, political, economic - can the return of security for Ukraine and the whole of Europe be brought closer. The more weapons, the more military-technical and financial support Ukraine receives, the sooner our people and all Europeans will be able to experience peace and stability in life again. And the third thing. I want to say it right now to the residents of the temporarily occupied territory. No matter what the occupiers promise, their only way is to escape. At best. If they make it in time. We expelled the Russian army from the northern regions. We expelled the invaders from our Zmiinyi Island. They already feel that the time has come to flee from Kherson and from the south of our country in general. The time will come when they will flee from the Kharkiv region, from Donbas, from Crimea... And everyone who can help in this, should do so. If you have any important information about the enemy, please report it in a safe way to our intelligence services, our military. If you know those who help the occupiers or justify aggression, please report this as well. Be sure to help our people in the occupied territory who are left alone or without communication. Talk to them, support them, tell them about our struggle and about the possibilities of evacuating to a free territory. The invaders are using our people to cover their attacks as human shields. Ukraine will return everything of its own, and must save as many lives as possible. I held several important meetings today, in particular, regarding the program for the fast recovery of liberated territories. I continue to establish new ties at the highest level with African countries - today I spoke with the President of the Republic of Ghana. Yesterday - with the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Food security, cooperation in international organizations, economic ties are a range of issues that benefit both our state and African countries. In the evening, I signed another decree awarding our defenders. 244 combatants were awarded state awards, 21 of them posthumously. Ukrainians should always remember that every step of our army in this war was made in cruel and difficult battles. The occupiers have not captured anything without the resistance of our heroes since February 24 and will not be able to keep anything. We will liberate everything. Eternal glory to everyone who fights for our country! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No one will be able to stop the wind carrying radiation, but all of us can stop the terrorist state of Russia - President&#x27;s speech at the Conference of Defense Ministers of Northern European Countries and Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-11</span></div>
  <p>Dear Prime Minister Frederiksen! Dear Minister Bødskov! Dear attendees, dear participants of the Conference! I am grateful for the organization of such an important event, which is urgently needed now - and not only for Ukraine. To begin with, I would like to remind you of one episode of our shared history. It happened in Sweden. About 700 kilometers from Copenhagen, just over an hour by plane. One day at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, radiation monitoring devices showed the presence of radiation contamination. Then everything was quickly checked and no sources of radiation were found in Forsmark. However, reports began to arrive from other sites in Sweden, as well as from Finland, that there was also an increased level of radiation. Concerns were also raised in Denmark - an increase in the level of radioactive substances was also recorded there. It became clear that an emergency had occurred, but at that time they did not know exactly where. They analyzed the nature of the pollution, the direction and velocity of the wind - and found out that somewhere in the territory from Minsk to the Black Sea, a disaster occurred. It was April 1986 - a day after the explosion of the nuclear reactor in Chornobyl. The Soviet authorities were silent about what happened at that time. And tried to downplay the scale of the disaster. However, it was impossible to hide it - there has already been publicity in Europe, there has already been evidence of pollution, and a discussion has already begun about how it threatens all people. I will not remind you now of all the details of those days. You all probably know about it. About the fire at the Chornobyl station and the efforts of those who tried to stop the unfolding of the disaster. About the diagnosis of &quot;acute radiation syndrome&quot; and about people who begged for salvation in terrible death agonies. Significant areas were contaminated. There is still an Exclusion Zone around Chornobyl, where people are not allowed to live. Hundreds of thousands of residents of different countries were affected by Chornobyl in one way or another. And for years after that disaster, the whole world has been thinking about how to make nuclear energy secure. For years, adherence to special standards has been monitored to ensure that such disasters do not occur. And for years absolutely no one could imagine that Europe could be threatened with a new disaster at a nuclear plant not because someone would violate some safety standards, but because some state would deliberately use a nuclear plant for terror. This is what Russia is doing now. And if the Soviet authorities tried to conceal the Chornobyl disaster and its full consequences, the Russian authorities are much more cynical and dangerous - they themselves do everything to maximize the risk of a nuclear disaster, and lie to the whole world that someone else is allegedly to blame. We must protect Europe from this threat. Protect all together. And probably not only Europe. Because the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is the largest on our continent. It is the third largest in the world. Six power units! During the years of operation of this station, there was not a single incident that would endanger the safety of Ukrainians or all Europeans. But now the Russian occupation army is using the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for terror and armed provocations. Russia has turned the nuclear plant into a battlefield. When the occupiers came to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, their tanks fired at it. Direct fire at the plant! Placing military equipment on the territory of the plant and even disposing of ammunition there, the Russian troops surely know that they are putting the whole of Europe at risk of a nuclear disaster. And of course, the Russian authorities are aware of the possible consequences when their troops fire at a nuclear plant. In particular, from MLRS. In August, it was already now, they damaged the plant&#x27;s communication lines with our power system, as well as radiation monitoring sensors, nitrogen-oxygen station, hydrogen pipelines and related infrastructure. Already then, Europe was a few steps away from a nuclear disaster. And now we are all in this difficult situation. We are convinced that it is not a coincidence that the trajectory of the cruise missiles which Russia fires at the territory of Ukraine passes over the Ukrainian nuclear power plants. All these are manifestations of Russian nuclear terrorism. Russia has become a terrorist state, and is actually holding nuclear plants hostage, and is blackmailing everyone with a probable disaster. I am sure each of you has already thought about how to act if Russia uses so-called tactical nuclear weapons. Think about this as well. Russia can cause the largest radiation accident in history at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. In terms of actual consequences, it could be even more catastrophic than Chornobyl, and in fact - the same as the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, but without a nuclear strike. None of us can stop the wind if it carries radiation. But together we are capable of stopping a terrorist state. And the sooner we stop Russia, the sooner Europe and the world will be able to feel safe again. Everything that is necessary for this is well known to you. Sanctions against Russia must be strengthened and not allowed to be circumvented. In response to nuclear blackmail, tough sanctions are needed against Rosatom, this is a specific thing, and the entire Russian nuclear industry, not an agreement with them. Constant political pressure on Russia is needed to increase the number of countries participating in the anti-war coalition, and to reduce the circle of those who are at least somehow willing to help Russia in these circumstances. And most importantly, we need even greater support for Ukraine with weapons and ammunition. To really stop Russia, the Armed Forces of Ukraine must have as many shells as necessary to make it tangible that Russia is not able to put pressure on the battlefield. And Ukraine needs weapons of such power, such a long range that Russia is forced to finally think about finding a peaceful solution. Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov who is present among you at the Conference will definitely inform you about specific defense needs. The second point is finances. Russia still receives tens of billions of dollars due to trade with other countries, and Europe in particular. And in Ukraine, the monthly deficit of the state budget alone is about five billion dollars. And the destruction caused by the war is happening on the territory of Ukraine. And we cannot wait until the war is over to restore normal life. Our children have to go to school just like yours. Our youth, just like yours, have to study at universities. Hospitals and social infrastructure have to work in Ukraine just like yours. Therefore, Ukraine needs reconstruction. Now! Just now! And even more so on the eve of the winter season. We need to carry out demining. And, of course, we need to prepare the defense for winter conditions. Therefore, sufficient and timely financial support for our state, for the budget and for the Fast Recovery is as vital as weapons and ammunition for our army, and sanctions against Russia. And the state that blocks this financing for Ukraine cannot have excuses. It should remember that it is a European country and should fix this problem immediately. And the third point is the export to Russia, the supply of components and dual-use products to the companies of the terrorist state. Russia simply would not have a combat-ready army in modern conditions if it was not for imported parts. Electronics, optics and many other parts of foreign production are used in manufacturing missiles, drones, means of communication, armored vehicles, etc. This flow of technical assistance to Russian terror must be completely stopped! There must be an effective mechanism to control any supply to Russia, so as not to miss a single detail that could go to the production of weapons for shelling peaceful cities or nuclear plants. Ladies and Gentlemen! The response now needs to be full-scale, just like the war that Russia started. No one needs new disasters. It is necessary to draw conclusions from the disaster of 1986. From the decades that Russia used to prepare for this vile war against all of free Europe. From eight years of war in Donbas. And from one hundred and seventy days of terror against Ukraine after February 24. No silence - only the truth. No delay - only decisive action. No confusion - only confident, bold unity. We need maximum weapons and ammunition for our defense. Finances are needed for Ukraine in sufficient volume and without any bureaucratic blockages. Complete isolation of the terrorist state, primarily economic, technological, and the toughest sanctions are required. It is our duty to our nations, to all future generations of free people, to do everything we can to stop Russia, to ensure that it loses this war and that no other state can repeat this terror. And I believe that we will fulfill our duty! Thank you for your attention! I am grateful to Denmark and Great Britain for jointly organizing this Conference, which could become historic. Due to our joint efforts. Thank you again! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Only the complete withdrawal of Russians from the Zaporizhzhia NPP guarantees the restoration of nuclear safety for the whole of Europe - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-11</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Brief summaries of the day. I took part in the donor conference in Copenhagen. These are 26 partner states of Ukraine: European countries, the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand. They established another format - as a continuation of the well-known meetings at the Ramstein Air Base. This format is about long-term support, including weapons, ammunition, military training, demining, recovery of the liberated territory. We already have the first results of the conference. Immediately after the opening of the meeting, Denmark announced a new support package for Ukraine in the amount of 110 million euros. In general, the conference collected 1.5 billion euros in just one day, which will be spent, in particular, on the production of vital ammunition. By the way, this is a significant plus to those credit guarantees for 4 billion dollars that were previously provided by the United States to strengthen our defense cooperation with partners on the supplies for the Ukrainian army. I am thankful to everyone who supported Ukraine today in Copenhagen, and I believe that this format of cooperation will accelerate our joint victory. In my address to the conference participants, I emphasized that everyone needs to act much faster and tougher. And especially after Russia resorted to unconcealed nuclear blackmail. What is happening now around the Zaporizhzhia NPP is one of the biggest crimes of the terrorist state. Today, another shelling by Russia was recorded on the territory of the plant, in the immediate vicinity of the NPP facilities. Russia has once again gone through another floor in the world history of terrorism. No one else has used a nuclear plant so obviously to threaten the whole world and to put forward some conditions. And absolutely everyone in the world should react immediately to expel the occupiers from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This is a global interest, not just a Ukrainian need. We emphasize this at all levels - from the UN Security Council to contacts between states. Only the complete withdrawal of Russians from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the restoration of Ukraine&#x27;s full control over the situation around the plant will guarantee the restoration of nuclear safety for all of Europe. Today I would like to point out an important thing for all representatives of the state and local authorities, the military sphere and other persons who comment on the events at the front, the defense plan of the command, the preparation of specific operations, etc. The general rule is simple: war is definitely not the time for vanity and loud statements. The less concrete details you give about our defense plans, the better it will be for the implementation of those defense plans. If you want to leave the big headlines, that&#x27;s one thing. Frankly irresponsible. If you want victory for Ukraine, then that is another thing, and you should feel your responsibility for every word you say about our state’s preparation for defense or counteroffensive. Another conversation took place in the permanent format &quot;Yermak, Sullivan, Zaluzhny, Milley&quot;. The topic of the conversation is clear. The content is positive. And the details, I think, are superfluous. I met today with chef Jose Andres, the founder of World Central Kitchen international humanitarian organization. For more than ten years, he has been feeding people in countries that have become victims of war or natural disasters. A successful restaurateur, working in America, one of the most famous and influential people in the world. From the first days of Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against our country, his organization started working on the border with Poland - for migrants. Subsequently, it started activities in many cities of Ukraine - already 5 thousand people work there. More than 130 million meals have been cooked for our citizens. We agreed with Mr. Andres on the expansion of such a humanitarian mission, in particular to areas that are gradually being liberated from Russian occupation. And today I also want to thank all Ukrainians and citizens of the friendly states who help meet the humanitarian needs created by this war. Those who help displaced people with housing and jobs. Those who treat and rehabilitate those wounded by Russian shelling. Those who deliver medicine, food and means of communication to the frontline areas. Those who support lonely people and orphans of this war. And those who help restore everything that was destroyed by Russian terrorists. This is a multi-thousand-strong humanitarian army of Ukraine and the entire free world, to which Russia cannot and will not be able to oppose anything. I thank you! Tomorrow will be a busy day - there will be many international and domestic events tomorrow. We are already preparing for them. We do everything to ensure that our defenders have reliable support at the political, diplomatic, economic, humanitarian and all other levels. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Glory to each and every one who defends Donbas, the Kharkiv region, the south, the center and our entire state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Visa restrictions for Russian citizens fair, all defenders of European values should insist on them – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-12</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today, for the first time, Ukraine celebrates the International Youth Day simultaneously with most of the world&#x27;s countries. This decision was made last summer – to postpone its celebration to August 12 to be together with Europe in such a symbolic event. And it worked. Youth Day felt very organic today. And above all, together with the First Lady, we met with young heroes-saviors - you are great, I am proud of children and teenagers who are strong despite their age, responsible despite their age. They raise funds for the army, they help our wounded, they help people, they help save people&#x27;s lives. A special awarding ceremony for such our young heroes was held in the Mariinsky Palace, in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine. Maksym Brovchenko, Irynka Vasylieva, Oleksandr Hutsal, Yehor Shemet, Davyd Ponuliak, Hlib Bondarenko, Andriy Pokrasa, Danylo Serheev. They are from seven to sixteen years old, and they are heroes. And one can be proud of their deeds in such a way that not every adult has such a biography. I also met today with representatives of various youth communities and organizations – educational, volunteer, military, creative, Plast, with representatives of youth from the diaspora... I am very proud that Maryna Viazovska, one of the most famous young Ukrainian women, who received the highest award in the world of mathematics – the famous Fields Medal, also attended the meeting. We had a very warm and fruitful conversation about the defense of our country, about victory – and it is on the horizon, about the future of Ukraine, about our institutions. The ideas sounded very good – we will implement them. I had a talk with the pontiff today. I thanked Pope Francis for the support of Ukrainians. We discussed what we can do together to restore peace in the state. I briefed him on the situation on the front line and Russia&#x27;s constant efforts to increase the level of terror. He agrees with it, he supports us. The day before, a decision was made in Latvia – Latvia officially recognized Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. We are working to ensure that the whole world does the same. That&#x27;s fair. It is right. And it will be. After all that the occupiers have done in Ukraine, there can be only one attitude towards Russia - as towards a terrorist state. And, by the way, it is from this point of view that the attitude towards the citizens of Russia should be determined. I thank the Czech Republic, the Baltic states and other countries that brought the issue of visas for citizens of a terrorist state to the official level of discussion in Europe. Of course, we all understand: there are people who really need protection, who are persecuted in Russia, may even be killed, and therefore they should receive help from the civilized world. These are well-known legal mechanisms – through refugee status, asylum requests, and other opportunities to help and support. But it is for those who fight, for those who are persecuted. And this should not apply to the rest of Russian citizens in Europe, tourism, entertainment, business affairs. It is impossible to work for a terrorist state... First, there must be a guarantee that Russian murderers and facilitators of state terror will not use Schengen. And secondly, one cannot destroy the very idea of Europe, our common European values, that is, one cannot turn Europe into a supermarket where it does not matter who enters – the main thing is that a person simply pays for the goods. Therefore, visa restrictions for citizens of the Russian Federation are fair, and all defenders of European values should insist on them. In the evening, I signed a decree awarding our soldiers and heroes. A total of 181 combatants were given state awards, 33 of them posthumously. In total, more than 26,500 Ukrainian men and women were awarded during the war. I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! Who deters very brutal attacks of the occupiers in Pisky, in Avdiyivka, in the Bakhmut area... Who defends Kharkiv region and our south, our dear Ukraine. We will do everything so that each occupier, as well as the terrorist state in general, will fully feel what a strong Ukrainian response to their terror is. Glory to all our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will do everything so that new sanctions against Russia block its nuclear industry – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-13</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! And today I would like to address the residents of Nikopol, Marhanets, Enerhodar, Kryvy Rih, Zaporizhzhia and all our other cities and communities of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. The occupiers are trying to intimidate people in an extremely cynical way, using the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. They actually hide behind the plant to fire at Nikopol and Marhanets. They arrange constant provocations with shelling of the territory of the nuclear power plant and try to bring their additional forces in this direction to blackmail our state and the entire free world even more. If someone over there in Russia thinks that it can give them something, then they are wrong. Russian blackmail only mobilizes even more global efforts to confront terror. Every day of the stay of the Russian contingent on the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and in the neighboring regions of our country increases the radiation threat to Europe so much that even at the peak moments of the confrontation during the Cold War, this did not happen. Of course, there should be a robust response to this. Ukrainian diplomats and representatives of partner states will do everything to ensure that the new sanctions against Russia necessarily block the Russian nuclear industry. And absolutely all officials of the terrorist state, as well as those who help them in this blackmail operation with the nuclear power plant, must be tried by an international court. It will definitely be. And every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots under the cover of the plant, must understand that he is becoming a special target for our intelligence, for our secret service, for our army. I am especially grateful to everyone who defends this direction, who withstands the pressure of Russian terrorists and protects Ukraine and the world from the nuclear threat created by the occupiers. I am grateful to all our energy workers who support the stable operation of the energy system of Ukraine and the Zaporizhzhia plant itself. And we are doing everything possible to restore peace and security to this part of our state, and to all other cities and other regions of our beautiful Ukraine. Fierce fighting continues in Donbas. The hottest points of the front in this direction remain unchanged – Avdiyivka, Maryinka, Pisky, Bakhmut and the entire relevant area. Russia sent there a simply colossal amount of its military resources – artillery, equipment, people. All our defenders there are simply heroes. Ukrainian defense is strong in Kharkiv region, and the invaders&#x27; attempts to attack all the time fail. The struggle in the south of the country gives good news about the destruction of the forces and means of the Russian army. We do not lose a single day – we reduce the potential of the occupiers. It is very important that the export grain initiative gives results. Since the start of its implementation, a total of 16 vessels with grain for seven countries on three continents have left Ukrainian ports. These are Europe, Asia, Africa. Almost half a million tonnes of agricultural products were on board: corn, wheat, sunflower oil, soybeans and other goods absolutely necessary for the global market. This has already made it possible to reduce the severity of the food crisis, and has given some hope of peace to the countries that consume our agricultural products. And in the long run, it can help to completely remove the food crisis from the global agenda. Of course, if the partners ensure the implementation of the security part of the initiative and prevent Russian provocations and terror at sea or against our ports. The first vessel to be loaded within the framework of the UN World Food Program has already arrived. It is the supply of grain, in particular for Ethiopia, where the situation with hunger is particularly severe. Now the vessel is being prepared for departure from the Pivdenny port. For Ukraine, this has significant benefits. In less than two weeks, three of our ports – Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdenny – managed to export such a volume, which is equal to the entire agricultural export by road for July and more than two-thirds of the export by rail for the past month. I want to emphasize once again: these are jobs for our people, these are the funds needed for our sowing season next year, and these are the revenues of our state budget. Increasing economic activity is a necessary element of the path to victory. I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! Grateful to everyone in the partner countries who help fight against terror! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The stronger Ukraine will be, the weaker Russia will be and the less this war will last - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-14</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We are getting ready for the very active weeks of the second half of August – negotiations, meetings, the Crimea Platform, new appeals to foreign communities, international legal activity – on our initiative. This week, I will continue to expand our ties with African states and the Latin American region. Important contacts will take place at the European level tomorrow. In a few days, a ceremony of the presentation of credentials by the ambassadors of foreign countries who came to work in Kyiv will take place. Although there is a certain pause in global politics now - after all, it is August, for Ukraine, for the interests of our state, there haven’t been and will not be any pauses. We are working on new sanctions against Russia and on stimulating the citizens of the terrorist state to feel their share of responsibility for what is happening. The discussion about visa restrictions in Europe for holders of Russian passports is expanding every day, new states and new politicians are joining it. Ultimately, this should lead to appropriate decisions. I am grateful to our intelligence officers, law enforcement officers, journalists and everyone who works to establish the full data on the Russian killers. Ukraine and our partners are receiving more and more information about those directly responsible for terror and torture, for the so-called filtration and deportation of our people, for looting... All these savages will definitely be held to account. But we must remember that when evil takes on such proportions, people&#x27;s silence approaches the level of complicity. And the rejection of the real fight against evil becomes the assistance to it. Therefore, if you have Russian citizenship and you are silent, it means that you are not fighting, it means that you are supporting it. And no matter where you are - both on the territory of Russia and abroad - your voice should sound in support of Ukraine, and therefore against this war. In the near future, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine will have to make a decision on the extension of martial law and general mobilization. An obvious decision, obvious reasons. Ukraine has always longed and longs for peace and many times in various negotiation formats has offered the Russian leadership to end the war and free Ukrainian land from occupation. But so far, Russia believes in terror, remains in the grip of its propaganda illusions and still hopes that it can supposedly achieve something through various forms of blackmail. It won’t. And therefore, we must defend ourselves, we must respond to every manifestation of terror, to all shelling occasions - brutal shelling that does not stop for a single day. Unfortunately, we have losses. But we must fight at all levels and on all fronts, strengthen our state as much as possible, preserve our unity and attract even more countries to our anti-war coalition. The stronger Ukraine will be, the weaker Russia will be, and therefore, the less time this war will last. And everyone in Ukraine, everyone in the free world must do everything in their power and everything possible so that Russia and those who support the war pay an ever greater price for Russian state terror. I am thankful to all our defenders! I am thankful to all Ukrainians - all those who hold on, who help others, who believe in victory and bring it closer by their actions - as they can. Each new day should bring a new result for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russian troops must be immediately withdrawn from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP without any conditions - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-15</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! And all Europeans whose lives are already endangered by Russian terror. Russia does not stop its blackmail in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Provocative shelling of the NPP territory continues. Under the cover of the plant, the occupiers are shelling nearby cities and communities. The Russian troops hide ammunition and equipment right in the facilities of the plant. De facto the plant is mined. All this clearly shows that Russia is rejecting the security demands of the European Union countries and 15 other countries - 42 in total - that called on Russia to withdraw its forces from the plant. In particular, these are Turkey, Georgia, Great Britain, Korea, Japan, Australia, Canada, the United States of America. If a terrorist state allows itself to completely ignore the demands of the international community, especially in such a sensitive topic, this clearly indicates the need for immediate action. Any radiation incident at the Zaporizhzhia NPP can affect the countries of the European Union, Turkey, Georgia and countries from more distant regions. Everything depends solely on the direction and speed of the wind. If Russia&#x27;s actions cause a catastrophe, the consequences may also hit those who remain silent so far. This issue has already been brought to the highest international level - the UN and the IAEA. Of course, Russian nuclear blackmail is also discussed between states. There is a corresponding statement from the ministers of foreign affairs of the G7. They clearly understand that Russia is responsible for this nuclear crisis. But we need to move from discussions and calls to new tough sanctions against Russia, against Rosatom and the entire nuclear industry of the terrorist state. All Russian troops must be immediately withdrawn from the plant and neighboring areas without any conditions. The world has been fighting for many decades for proper control over all activities with nuclear materials and radiation safety. And if now the world lacks the strength and determination to protect one nuclear plant, it means that the world loses. Loses to terrorists. Gives in to nuclear blackmail. And this may be a precedent that other terrorists will see. There is still a chance to prevent this defeat. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The main item on the agenda is a thorough analysis of the military-strategic situation. Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov and Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service Lytvynenko delivered reports. A separate report was delivered by Commander of the Special Operations Forces Khorenko. Of course, there were Zaluzhny, Shaptala, Monastyrskyi, Danilov, Yermak, Reznikov. We also considered - from what can be said publicly - the issue of providing our military with weapons and ammunition and the status of implementation of the previous decisions of the Staff - all of them must be implemented 100%, the responsibility for this is personal. A rather productive meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine took place today. Among other things, the deputies voted for two members of the High Council of Justice. I continue to establish relations at the highest level with African countries. Today I spoke with the President of Niger - until today there were no contacts at this level between our states. I thanked him for the support within the UN. Of course, the key threats to global security were discussed. I held a meeting on the preparation of the Crimea Platform. I expect the expansion of geography, level and number of participants. Today, the Advisory Council on the Deoccupation of Crimea was created to coordinate all measures and projects in this direction and ensure the activities of the Crimea Platform. I met with Andriy Shevchenko and actor Liev Schreiber, ambassadors of our state charity platform UNITED24. We discussed how we can maintain the maximum attention of the world to the needs of our defense. Each week, this task becomes increasingly important. Russia has created so many crises, including the crisis of the cost of living in many countries, as well as food and energy crises, that spread insecurity and irritation with life throughout the world. We must keep global attention focused on the root cause of these crises, namely: Russian aggression. And we have to remind that it was Ukraine that suffered the most from Russian terror. I am grateful to all who perform this important function, in particular the UNITED24 ambassadors. Their activity means billions of hryvnias for Ukraine and a constant increase in attention to the needs of our state and people. The situation on the frontline has not undergone significant changes over the past day. The heroic resistance of our military continues in Donbas, the Kharkiv region. We are putting pressure on the enemy in the south of our country. I would like to especially thank all our gunners, our intelligence officers, the Security Service of Ukraine and all others who ensure the successive destruction of the occupiers&#x27; command posts and their ammunition depots. All Russian terrorists should know that every meter of Ukrainian land is an absolute danger for them. No matter how they try to hide. No matter where it is. They will be found and destroyed. Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to everyone who helps our state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>For us to expel the occupiers from Ukraine, every day must make it more and more difficult for Russia to wage a war - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-16</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Every day and every night we see new reports of explosions in the territory temporarily occupied by the occupiers. I am now asking all our people in Crimea, in other regions in the south of the country, in the occupied areas of Donbas, in the Kharkiv region to be very careful. Please do not approach the military objects of the Russian army and all those places where they store ammunition and equipment, where they keep their headquarters. The reasons for the explosions in the occupied territory can be different, very different, in particular, I quote the definition of the occupiers themselves, &quot;bungling&quot;. But they all have the same meaning: the destruction of the occupiers&#x27; logistics, their ammunition, military and other equipment, command posts saves the lives of our people. The fewer opportunities the occupiers have to do evil and kill Ukrainians, the sooner we will be able to end this war by liberating our land. And the queue these days to leave Crimea for Russia across the bridge proves that the absolute majority of citizens of the terrorist state already understand or at least feel that Crimea is not a place for them. And I want to thank all Ukrainians who help our Armed Forces, our intelligence, our special services weaken the army of the occupiers. This is a significant advantage of Ukraine and the root cause of our future victory - the struggle of our defenders is based on the unconditional support of the Ukrainian people. This is a people&#x27;s war of liberation, this is an all-Ukrainian struggle for freedom and independence for our country. Ukraine is protected by millions in one way or another. Millions of people who fight at the front, who fight for their cities and villages, including in the occupation, who stopped the occupiers&#x27; military equipment, who informed and inform our intelligence and special services, who oppose the occupiers in their rear, who ensure the necessary supplies for Ukraine and the work of all our state institutions and economy, who volunteer, who fight for our interests abroad, who fight in the information war. And we have to do - and will do - everything to preserve this nationwide foundation of defense. For the support of Ukraine in the world not to decrease and for our state to move towards victory, our own activity should not decrease either - the activity of absolutely everyone who in one way or another stood up for the defense of our state. Do everything, as you have been doing, for Ukraine. And even more, because the leadership of Russia expects that Ukrainians, Europeans and the whole world will get tired of this war. We must do everything so that it is not us or our friends and partners who get tired, but our enemy. For us to expel the occupiers from Ukraine, every day must make it more and more difficult for Russia to wage a war - this is our number one military-political task. I spoke today with President of France Emmanuel Macron. I informed him about the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and regular Russian provocations. I thanked him for the great support. In particular, Mr. President and I have discussed new security and macro-financial assistance to our state. I also held talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark. Also about increasing financial support for Ukraine, about new sanctions against Russia. I thanked Mrs. Frederiksen for the defense assistance and for the fruitful conference in Copenhagen which recently agreed on concrete decisions for our defense. For the first time in the history of our bilateral relations, I held talks with the President of Zambia. Cooperation in international organizations, food security and current global threats were discussed. Ban Ki-moon, the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations, and Juan Manuel Santos, ex-President of Colombia, visited Ukraine today. The main topic of conversation with them is security guarantees for Ukraine. We are doing everything to form a military, political and legal security architecture for Ukraine, which will be real, effective and work in the long term, guaranteeing peace to our people. The Russian army continued its absolutely senseless and brutal shelling of the cities of the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions - Orikhiv, Nikopol... Unfortunately, there are wounded, unfortunately, there are casualties. Shelling of Kharkiv and the border areas continues. But all this will not give anything to the occupiers and will not break our resistance. Our heroes repel constant and very powerful attacks in Donbas. The occupiers use everything there: aviation, missiles, phosphorus bombs, artillery... Very fierce battles are going on. We have to go through it, endure everything and gain life. Ukraine must win, and it will. Today I signed the decree on awarding our defenders. 189 warriors were awarded state awards. 158 are National Guard servicemen, 21 of them were awarded posthumously. 26 border guards, two of them posthumously. Three police officers, two of them posthumously. Two employees of the State Customs Service, one of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia deliberately deepening crisis of cost of living in many countries, that is why we must jointly resist its aggression – address of President of Ukraine to university community of Chile</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. Rector! Dear students and university teachers who joined our conversation today! Dear journalists and everyone present! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and tell you what is happening in Ukraine and why the Russian war against our country is still going on. Why there is no peace. A full-scale war, a full-scale Russian invasion of the territory of Ukraine has been going on for 175 days. For 175 days, millions of Ukrainians have defended the independence of our state. But not only independence. This is a struggle not only for the state and not only for the opportunity of our people to independently decide their future. Indeed, the primary motive of Russian aggression against Ukrainians is purely colonialist – the Russian leadership wants its domination over Ukrainian land and over our resources. And for a long time it was heard in Moscow that they would not restore the Russian empire without seizing the territory of Ukraine. However, it became a much deeper struggle than any imperial or geopolitical intentions. Russia is literally waging a war against the lives of our people, against the very right to life of Ukrainians. And this war started not 175 days ago. On February 24 of this year, Russia switched to massive aggression – to attacks from the north, from the east, and from the south at once; all our ports on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov were blocked; massive missile strikes were launched throughout the territory of Ukraine. But it was a continuation of the war. The war that began in 2014. It began when Russia occupied the Crimean peninsula, ignited the confrontation in Donbas, which claimed thousands of lives. They were thousands. Therefore, when we talk about Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine, we are talking about eight years and 175 days. And when we talk about the victims of this war, about Ukrainian losses, we do not start the story from February 2022. We start it in 2014, when Ukrainians began to be killed simply because they were Ukrainians. For the Ukrainian flag. For a pro-Ukrainian position. For defending the Ukrainian territory. Even simply for the suspicion that a person supports the Ukrainian state. Today I want to tell you about one such person. About a guy who would have turned 25 this fall, and he would probably be a lot like you right now. His name was Stepan Chubenko. He was from the city of Kramatorsk in Donbas. Bright young man. He was remembered as kind and very active – if he had entered a university similar to yours, he would probably have become one of the student leaders. Perhaps he would not have betrayed his dream and chosen the path of a sports career – and he would have been able to become the goalkeeper of one of the teams you know. I ask you to look at these photos now – that&#x27;s the kind of guy he was. He was killed on July 27, 2014. He was killed by militants – one of those whose hands Russia used to wage a hybrid war in Donbas and whom it is now using in the full-scale war. They detained Stepan when he was returning home. They saw a yellow and blue ribbon on his backpack – the colors of our flag. And that was reason enough for them to grab the boy. He was beaten for several days, tortured, and shot. Only in the middle of August of that year, weeks after the murder, Stepan&#x27;s mother managed to find out what happened to her son. But she was not given his body. Only in November 2014 it was possible to bury him. Stepan&#x27;s mother has the last text message from him: &quot;I&#x27;ll call you later, I love you.&quot; His killers hid in the territory of Russia and Crimea occupied by Russia. They received sentences from the Ukrainian court. But the terrorist state Russia protects them from being prosecuted. Them and thousands of other such murderers. Those who shot people simply because they were Ukrainians. Simply because they were Ukrainians in Ukraine. Those who shot men and women in the back of the head for the mere suspicion that the person was defending our state. Those who shot at residential buildings, at schools and hospitals point blank from tanks. Those who used artillery to bombard peaceful cities. It started back then – in 2014, and 175 days ago it reached the maximum scale that the Russian army, Russian mercenaries from the so-called military companies, which are de facto part of the secret services of the terrorist state, are capable of. Russia really wants to seize the territory of Ukraine. And it needs this territory without Ukrainians. The destroyed Mariupol and dozens of other cities and villages of Ukraine, the Bucha massacre and other cities in the occupied territory are not exceptions to the general Russian strategy, this is what it is – the Russian strategy towards Ukraine and Ukrainians. Tens of thousands of our people are kept for months in the so-called &quot;filtration camps&quot; set up by the Russian military. Thousands of Ukrainian children were deported from the territory entered by the Russian army. They are taken to Russia, and Russian officials are trying to do everything so that these children lose all contact with their families and simply forget who they are. Monuments and museums that simply remind of Ukraine are being destroyed on the occupied territory. They destroy books. They do everything so that people are forced to give up their national identity, their aspirations, dreams, and obey violence and robbery or die. Ukraine has already lost the lives of tens of thousands of its people in this war. Very small children – one-month-old babies, who were killed by Russian missiles, shells and bullets. Teenagers. Men and women. Elderly people. Russia does not care who to kill and who to abuse. Everyone is equally its target. And these are not excesses of war. This is its conscious policy. Therefore, we have no other choice but to fight for the lives of Ukrainians, so that in Ukraine they are not killed for a yellow-blue ribbon on a teenager&#x27;s backpack. And this struggle can last only until victory. I can&#x27;t count how many times before February 24 I suggested to Russia to end the war and negotiate peace. In different formats, through different mediation. It took many years to negotiate. But the leadership of Russia chose terror, not an agreement. They chose what they did in Mariupol, in Bucha, not peace. And when Moscow saw that the world would not turn a blind eye to Russian atrocities, they wanted to bring the whole world to its knees. That is why the food crisis has become so acute. That is why Russia is deliberately destabilizing the energy markets. That is why Russian policy is deepening the crisis of the cost of living in many countries for mercenary motives. And this is why we must jointly resist Russian aggression. When a state turns energy poverty or hunger into a weapon, it is a blow to everyone in the world. When a state tries to conquer another because it wants to be a colonizer, it is a threat to all who value their independence. And when people are killed simply because they are, because they belong to their people, because they do not give up their homeland, it is a threat to humanity as such. Can you stay away? Can you stay indifferent? I don&#x27;t believe that. That is why you are here today, because you value the truth. And I&#x27;m not asking too much of you. I ask you to spread only the truth – spread the truth about this war in your country and in your region. It is necessary to oppose Russian propaganda. Demand full accountability for Russian murderers and executioners. Every war crime must receive its verdict by a competent and honest court. Support sanctions against Russia – because the aggressor must pay the highest price for aggression. And most importantly, value peace, value life, value your freedom and always, when you have such an opportunity, help defend peace, life and freedom by protecting those from whom they want to take it. I am very grateful to each of you, thank you for your attention!</p>

  <h2>Only absolute transparency and controlled situation at and around ZNPP can guarantee return to normal nuclear safety – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Diplomacy in the interests of our country is very active these days. First of all, today a ceremony of presenting credentials to the new ambassadors of foreign countries who arrived to work in our capital was held in the Sophia of Kyiv. The work of embassies in full capacity, the presence of ambassadors in Kyiv is one of the important indicators of the strength of our state, the Ukrainian ability to fight and win. Already 55 diplomatic missions have resumed their work. And today, the new ambassadors of Belgium, Spain, Kyrgyzstan and Romania presented their credentials. Secondly, UN Secretary General António Guterres has already arrived in Ukraine. We will work to get the necessary results for Ukraine. Thirdly, Ukrainian diplomats, our nuclear scientists and the IAEA are in constant touch, now they are working on sending the IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Only absolute transparency and controlled situation at and around the ZNPP can guarantee a gradual return to normal nuclear safety for the Ukrainian state, for the international community, and for the IAEA. The Russian army must withdraw from the territory of the nuclear power plant and all neighboring areas, and take away its military equipment from the plant. This must happen without any conditions and as soon as possible. Ukraine is ready to ensure proper control of the IAEA, and the relevant mission can be sent to the Zaporizhzhia plant in a legal way, very fast and as efficiently as possible. Today, I made a very important address to the university communities, journalists and political circles of Chile and Latin America in general. This is not an easy direction of foreign policy – we are doing many things there now practically from scratch. We are working not only at the political level, but also establishing relations directly with the societies of the countries of this region. I called on Chileans and all freedom-loving people in Latin America to spread the truth about Russia&#x27;s war against our country and to support the sanctions policy aimed at making the terrorist state pay the highest possible price for terror. In the evening, I signed new decrees on awarding our soldiers. 230 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards, 43 of them posthumously. Also, 24 employees of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine were awarded state awards. All our soldiers – our army, our intelligence, border guards, the National Guard, the SBU and everyone involved in defending our state and people are doing everything possible to fight Russian terrorists and push them out of Ukrainian land. The Avdiyivka area, Bakhmut area, Kharkiv region, and some other regions are the regions where the most difficult fighting is going on right now. I am grateful to everyone who withstands this pressure, who defends positions and helps our soldiers. In Zaporizhzhia region, in some areas of the south of the country, the occupiers are trying to improve their situation, but strategically it is hopeless for them. Ukrainian soldiers will destroy the potential of the occupiers step by step, and the day will come when the enemy will die in Zaporizhzhia, in the south, in the east of the country, and in Crimea. The invaders will die like dew on the sun, and our defense is and will be this sun. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to all those who focused on helping our people in a true Ukrainian unity! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We can and should think only about how to win - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-18</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we are in Lviv, the Potocki Palace, now. At the end of this very busy day, here’s my report on events, meetings, negotiations and decisions. We have been here since the morning. And once again I want to thank the city of Lviv, all Lviv residents for the attention, comfort and emotional support felt throughout the day. First of all, I paid a visit to our defenders - those who are being treated after injuries in the hospital. Very brave guys, strong. I thanked the doctors who are doing everything to restore the health of our warriors as soon as possible. I was very happy to see the boys and girls studying at the Petro Sahaidachnyi National Ground Forces Academy. It was extremely pleasant to hear that more and more people want to become officers of the Ukrainian army. The competition for one place in the academy is of such a scale that used to be only in civilian universities before. And this really gives a reason to be proud not just of the patriotism of our youth, but of the fact that people believe in Ukraine, in our Armed Forces, in our victory. I presented awards to the best warriors. During a special ceremony on the Field of Mars of the Lychakiv Cemetery, we honored the memory of all those who gave their lives for Ukraine and for the independence of our country in this brutal war. There is no other alternative - we must return everything of ours and guarantee security for all future generations of Ukraine. I held talks with UN Secretary-General Guterres and President of Türkiye Erdoğan. Most of the points discussed are already in the news. I want to say a few main things now. First. There are no objective obstacles to prevent the IAEA mission from reaching the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Today, Mr. Guterres and I discussed the parameters of this mission and the fact that it can get to the plant very quickly and quite safely in a legal way through the free territory of our state. And just like that. The one who organized nuclear blackmail certainly cannot be the &quot;transporter&quot; of any such missions. Russia must immediately and unconditionally allow IAEA representatives to the plant and also immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from the territory of the plant. The world has the power to ensure this. If it does not ensure this, we can simply throw the entire body of international documents on nuclear and radiation safety into the trash. Russia is destroying this international order. The second extremely important point of the negotiations is Ukrainian prisoners of war held by the Russian Federation. I called on Mr. Secretary-General to use all the capabilities of the UN to ensure Russia&#x27;s compliance with all norms of international law regarding prisoners of war. And we discussed sending a fact-finding mission to Olenivka. The full truth about this Russian terrorist attack must and will be established. Of course, we talked about the grain export initiative. The result is there - and not only for Ukraine, but also for the world, as it is felt that the severity of the global food crisis is decreasing. Therefore, there is a great need for more security, a greater volume of exports, more ships that can deliver Ukrainian food from our ports. I held very substantive negotiations on many topics today with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. I am grateful to him for his unwavering support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. We discussed defense, economic and energy cooperation. I am grateful to Türkiye for its willingness to take under patronage the reconstruction of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region. This is a mission for a truly powerful country. Today, the first step was taken - an agreement on infrastructure was signed. I called on both Mr. President and Mr. Secretary-General to voice the strictest possible position regarding Russia&#x27;s planned pseudo-referendums in the occupied territory. Any pseudo-referendum will be a slap in the face of the international community. And I want to mention one more thing today. It was an extremely hard night in Kharkiv - more than ten people died. Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia were again shelled. The Russian army is spending enormous resources to capture at least one more kilometer in Donbas. Russian officials reiterate threats to Odesa and other cities of Ukraine. We see what is happening at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. We see what happened in Olenivka. We can and should think only about how to win. To win on the battlefield, on the political front, in the information confrontation, in the economic plane, everywhere... Let’s believe in ourselves, help each other, protect the interests of Ukraine and know that there will be peace. He who fights and fights wisely wins. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken away by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The restoration of full security at the ZNPP and Enerhodar can begin with the mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-19</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All Europeans! For 177 days already, the report on the events in Ukraine is important for the entire continent. Ukrainian diplomats, our partners, representatives of the UN and the IAEA are working out the specific details of the mission to be sent to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. With this mission, the restoration of full security at the ZNPP and in Enerhodar can begin. And I am grateful to everyone who joined this work and initiative. If Russian blackmail with radiation continues, this summer may go down in the history of various European countries as one of the most tragic of all time. Because not a single instruction at any nuclear power plant in the world envisages a procedure in case a terrorist state turns a nuclear power plant into a target. Of course, today it is worth paying attention to another aspect of Russian blackmail in the field of energy. Gas supplies to Germany via the first Nord Stream are again being restricted and absurd statements are being made again that it is allegedly possible to compensate for something via Nord Stream 2. These &quot;streams&quot; are needed by Russia exclusively to supply problems to Europe, not to help someone there with gas. Now it is absolutely obvious. The longer the terrorist state remains on the European and world energy market, the longer it will not be stable. And the sooner everyone in Europe prepares their energy systems to exist without any supply of energy carriers from Russia, the sooner they will be able to calmly go through any winter. Today there was a very important visit to Ukraine by Eurocities representatives led by the mayor of Florence. This Association unites the mayors of more than 150 European cities, as well as representatives of dozens of other partner cities. We will cooperate with them directly - Ukrainian cities and communities with European cities and communities. The key issue is, of course, the rebuilding of our cities. The relevant memorandum was signed today. But not only this will be the subject of our important cooperation. The modern development of any country is primarily the development of cities, the creation of new opportunities and institutions in cities, the exchange of experience between cities and urban institutions. And therefore, these are new jobs, greater social capital and higher level of security for people. On the Ukrainian side, the subject of relations with the Association of European Cities will be our Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. I want to assure that every city of our state will benefit from this. We are interested in sustainable development throughout the territory of Ukraine - and it will be so. Without any exceptions. And today I want to address separately the residents of all our cities of Ukraine, which are subjected to constant brutal shelling by Russia. Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, all the cities of Donbas, the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Zaporizhzhia region... All those who experience this constant horror of the destruction of life and the destruction of everything that gives life normality. We will not leave any of these strikes unanswered. We will establish the identity of every occupier who gives orders and executes these strikes at cities. And we will bring them all to justice in one way or another. No murderer will hide. And we will certainly restore everything that the terrorists try to leave in ruins. The word &quot;ruins&quot; will never be a word about Ukraine, will never be a word about our cities. Russia will definitely not succeed in this. Eternal glory to all who bring our victory closer! Eternal glory to all who fight for our beautiful, strong Ukraine, for our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We still need to fight for victory, but Ukrainians can feel proud of themselves, their country and their heroes – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-20</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians I wish you health! We are actively preparing for the new week, which is very important for all of us, for our country. Our Flag Day, our Independence Day is ahead. The commemoration of veterans of the war for the freedom of Ukraine is ahead. The Crimean platform is ahead. This year it is really special. This year, one can literally feel in the air of Crimea that the occupation there is temporary, and Ukraine is returning. We will definitely remember our legends – this is and will be a Ukrainian tradition. Let us remember those whose lives have become a part of our national history, which can never be erased by anyone – by no enemy. Next week, as usual, important negotiations and visits of true friends of Ukraine are planned... A significant milestone is ahead – six months of this full-scale invasion. The war that changed everything for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the world. Of course, there will be time to tell about it. And tell in detail. But let&#x27;s still think today, take a look, assess the path we have taken. How much has been changed – what almost everyone in the world thought was impossible to change. How much it was managed to win, wrest from the Russian army, which for decades was thought to be invincible. I remember the first days of the full-scale invasion, I remember what various &quot;advisors&quot; told me and advised me then... I know that many of them are now ashamed of the words that were said then. Since February 24, during these 178 days, Ukrainians have proven that our people are invincible, our defenders are invincible. And I thank everyone who showed their strength during this time, I thank everyone who fought and is fighting for Ukraine, I thank everyone who fights and helps our soldiers, our state. Our unity, our faith in ourselves made it possible to pass these six months and approach this week, which is always important for every Ukrainian. We have always said and we say honestly: for the sake of Ukraine&#x27;s victory, we still need to fight, we still need to do a lot, we still need to persevere and endure, unfortunately, a lot of pain. But Ukrainians can feel proud of themselves, their country, and their heroes. And let&#x27;s all feel it together today - let&#x27;s feel the power of our people, our beautiful people. This power has always been and will be – as long as we believe in ourselves, as long as we preserve our unity, as long as we fight for Ukraine, and as long as we work for our common Ukrainian victory. We should be aware that this week Russia may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel. Such is our enemy. But in any other week during these six months, Russia did the same thing all the time – disgusting and cruel. One of the key tasks of the enemy is to humiliate us, Ukrainians, to devalue our capabilities, our heroes, to spread despair, fear, to spread conflicts... Therefore, it is important never, for a single moment, to give in to this enemy pressure, not to wind oneself up, not to show weakness. We must all be strong enough to resist any enemy provocations – as much as it takes to make the occupiers answer for all their blows and terror – for Kharkiv and Donbas, for Azovstal and Mykolaiv, for the filtration camps, for Bucha , Irpin for all cities... We must all be strong enough to endure and go all the way to Ukrainian victory. That&#x27;s why we stay together! We help each other! We restore the destroyed! We fight for all our people. And we cheer for those who represent Ukraine, today – definitely for Usyk, our boy! We believe in ourselves! We believe in Ukraine! Glory to each and every one of you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia will cut itself off from negotiations if it organizes a show trial of captured Ukrainian defenders - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-21</span></div>
  <p>Good night, Ukrainians! All our defenders! The 180th day of our defense and a new week begin. The week we look forward to every year, as it is the time of our main holiday, the holiday of Ukraine - Independence Day. And this week the occupiers definitely did not expect to be such... They could not have imagined that even now, after six months of such a brutal war, we will celebrate our independence on our land and in our capital. But it is so. This is our land. This is our independence, which no one can break and no one can take away. And you know it is so. Everyone in Ukraine feels it. 180 days - almost six months - the absolute majority of our people have no doubt that we will achieve the victory of Ukraine. We are united, we are more confident now than we have been in many decades. And this is one of the foundations of our strength, our power. And therefore, it is one of the main targets for Russian terrorists. They strike at the feelings of Ukrainians, at the wounds in the souls of our people just as at our cities... They strike cruelly, cynically. But with a different weapon. And not only with propaganda, not only with lies. Tormenting people, all those who suffer the biggest pain, the greatest difficulties, is one of the terrible means of pressure, which has become commonplace for Russia. And now there are enough reports in the media that in Mariupol the scenery is being prepared for an absolutely disgusting and absurd show trial of Ukrainian defenders, of our warriors who are captives of the occupiers. No matter what the occupiers are thinking, no matter what they are planning, the reaction of our state will be absolutely clear. If this despicable show trial takes place, if our people are brought into this scenery in violation of all agreements, all international rules, if there is abuse... This will be the line beyond which any negotiations are impossible. Russia will cut itself off from the negotiations. There will be no more conversations. Our state has said everything. All partners of Ukraine have been informed about what the terrorist state can prepare for this week. Today I spoke with President Macron about all the threats. President of Türkiye Erdoğan is also informed about all this. The Secretary-General of the UN, I am sure, will also react. They and other world leaders received appropriate signals from us. Everyone understands everything. They understand what the occupiers are doing and what it threatens. And they understand that Ukraine will not tolerate this. It will not tolerate tormenting of people about whom only one thing can be said: they are heroes of their Homeland, they defended the freedom of their people from invaders on their land. Even in times of war, there must be rules. The power of the world is definitely enough to bring any state, any terrorist under the power of these rules. Well, all of us - all Ukrainians - must remember one thing: no matter what, our goal is victory. No matter what, we are heading towards victory in spite of everything. No matter what, glory to all our warriors! Ukraine is above everything! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>These days, if you are abroad, be there with the flag of Ukraine and spread the truth about the crimes of the occupiers - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-22</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on the activity during the day. I took part in the work of a special forum of veterans. And announced changes in state policy regarding the veteran community - we must create more opportunities for veterans. Without such changes, without this reform, it is simply impossible. Veterans of the war for independence of Ukraine have become one of the most significant and respected groups in our society. With their specificity, with their needs, with their expectations, which must be responded to so that veterans can contribute not only to the defense of our state on the frontline, but also to the post-war development of Ukraine. And not only the state must react, but also business, which is very important, employers, education. We will create such a system of veteran policy and services for veterans, opportunities for their transition from military affairs to civilian life, which will be on a par with the strongest similar systems in the world. You can cite the example of the Israeli model, as well as the American one. But our goal is for the Ukrainian experience of veteran policy to eventually become a new example for others in the world to follow. I held a large meeting with representatives of the defense and security sector. Zaluzhny, Monastyrskyi, Danilov, Budanov and others were present. The key issues are, of course, the situation on the frontline, the security situation in big cities, as well as specific security measures due to the holidays and important political events this week - meetings, negotiations. We are already fully prepared for the second summit of the Crimea Platform. This year&#x27;s summit will be even more powerful than last year, in terms of both the number of participants and the topics of discussion. We are significantly expanding the format of the Crimea Platform - tomorrow we will announce all the details. And today the new diplomatic and security format &quot;Kyiv Initiative&quot; was founded. Ukraine&#x27;s European neighbors are already participating in its work. These are Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and the Baltic states. We will gradually involve other countries. In the &quot;Kyiv Initiative&quot; format, the work takes place at the level of foreign policy advisors to the heads of state. From the Ukrainian side, these are Andriy Sybiha and Andriy Yermak. And this format will allow us to strengthen cooperation in the region and joint protection of our interests, primarily security. This is a very promising line of our work in the Euro-Atlantic direction. Today there is good infrastructural news - the railway branch connecting Ukraine and Moldova has been upgraded and launched. Moreover, we did it both on our territory and on the territory of Moldova - our &quot;Ukrzaliznytsia&quot; did it, well done. This route has been closed for almost 25 years, and now it is working for Ukraine again. This is an important transport direction. And the average volume of cargo per year can be about 10 million tons. I am grateful to our partners from Moldova. Search operations at the site of the occupiers&#x27; attack on a residential building in Kharkiv have ended. The building was destroyed by Russian shelling last Wednesday. Only today we managed to get the bodies of all the dead from under the rubble. This Russian strike alone claimed the lives of 19 people. One strike. And savages have not stopped such strikes at different parts of our country for 180 days. The total number of various cruise missiles that Russia has used against us is approaching 3,500. It is simply impossible to count the strikes of Russian artillery - there are too many of them, they are too intense. And at the same time, the terrorist state does not stop playing around with international structures and once again has the audacity to convene the UN Security Council to discuss its own provocations, its own terror at the Zaporizhzhia NPP... I am grateful to all European politicians who do not forget that the eighth sanctions package against Russia is needed. The longer the interval between sanctions packages is, the greater Russia&#x27;s audacity is. And I am grateful to all our friends, all friends of freedom in different countries of the world, who promote the need to recognize the objective reality and legally define Russia as a terrorist state. This decision will come sooner or later, and the only question is how many more lives Russia will manage to take away before the retaliatory strikes from the international community become truly tangible for those responsible for this terror. And, dear Ukrainians, especially these days, when we celebrate the day of our flag and the day of our independence, if you are somewhere abroad, please remind about Ukraine there, be there with the Ukrainian flag and spread the truth about the crimes of the occupiers. Let&#x27;s all stick together, no matter where we, Ukrainians, are! Glory to all who protect the state! Gratitude to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everything started with Crimea and will end with it - liberation of the peninsula from occupation is necessary - speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the opening of the Second Crimea Platform Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-23</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants and guests of the Crimea Platform, present here and there, not far from us, and we feel it! Dear citizens of Ukraine from Crimea and in Crimea. I know you are watching and hearing us today. It is very important for us. It is very important for me. For society, for each and every one of us. I know that Crimea stands with Ukraine and is waiting for us to return. I want you all to know, we will definitely be back. When we return and correct everything that the occupiers did on our Ukrainian peninsula. What has come to Crimea and the entire Black Sea region along with Russian aggression and Russian weapons? Catastrophic environmental threats, unprecedented destruction of Crimea&#x27;s nature, destruction of social life, economic decline, destruction of monuments, militarism. And when the Russian fleet, which is based in the occupied Crimea, blocked our ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, it provoked a global food crisis and the crisis of the rights of people - Crimeans, our wonderful citizens, citizens of our unitary state of Ukraine. But - in spite of everything, in spite of any threats - Ukraine is strong enough and capable enough to see a perspective for the Ukrainian Crimea. I have the honor to announce the start of the Second Summit of the Crimea Platform. In a year, we managed to significantly expand the capabilities of the Crimea Platform, Minister Kuleba mentioned that. Last year, 46 foreign countries and international organizations participated in the summit. This year the figure is almost 60. I am grateful to everyone. Much more state leaders - 40 presidents and prime ministers, including the leaders of the G7. I am grateful to all of you for understanding how important such actions are now - your support, our joint actions and our joint work. This year, representatives of two more continents - Africa and South America - have joined, and this demonstrates that there is no boundary in the world that the truth about the Russian war against Ukraine and our people would not overcome. Of course, it is obvious whom we have to fight. The presence of obvious security risks dictates that the summit takes place in online mode. But international practice has already proven that such a regime can be absolutely effective for politics, diplomacy, and most importantly, for the protection of freedom. And especially now I want to thank one of the leaders who is with us here in Kyiv today - Andrzej Duda, the President of Poland and a true friend of all Ukrainians. Andrzej, your presence next to me, next to the people of Ukraine, once again confirms the extremely close ties and historical understanding that exist between Ukrainians and Poles. Thank you! Ladies and Gentlemen! When I speak to our citizens, I often use the honorific address: all our defenders. In fact, today, addressing you, honorable leaders, honorable ministers, I can use the same words and with a related meaning: all defenders of the international legal order! This is why we are here today, this is why the Crimea Platform was established and has been working for a year already. We are restoring the power of international law, and it is thanks to this that we will return the Ukrainian flag to our land of Crimea, it is thanks to this that we will bring freedom to Ukrainian citizens in Crimea and certainly restore justice for all those who suffered from repression and abuse by the Russian occupiers. But to win, we must not forget the path that led to the current situation. The degradation of Russia began with the seizure of Crimea. It started with terror against the Crimean Tatar people, the indigenous people of Crimea. With repression on religious grounds, which probably became the largest religious persecution in Europe in the XXI century, against the Crimean Muslim community. There was also the expulsion from occupied Crimea of all ordinary people who said that Crimea is Ukraine, who were not afraid to defend Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian freedom in Crimea. Murders and torture - we saw it all - humiliation and looting - the occupiers committed all this in Crimea and continue to commit all this since the first weeks after its shameful capture. And then they spread these crimes to Donbas, to other countries, in particular to Syria, to African countries, where Russian banditry under the cover of Russian special services is now seen. Mass terror after February 24 became the logical completion of the degradation of this state, which not so long ago was invited to the table with the G7 and which now competes for supremacy with the most brutal regimes of the past, responsible for genocides, wars of aggression and deportations. We are grateful that many people in the world did not keep silent about all this, many people constantly resisted - helped us, fought. But at the same time, many remained silent - and it is true - tried not to notice what was happening in Crimea. And this, in my opinion, became one of the key reasons for everything that is happening now in Ukraine and in the world. It is important to remember that there was resistance on the peninsula. There were and are people, we know, who are not silent, who defend freedom and simply defend normal life in Crimea. They are oppressed. But we see them, we know about them, we are grateful to them. I recently received a letter from one of the qırımlılar, Nariman Celâl. Unfortunately, he is now behind bars. The occupiers imprisoned him on a completely false charge, for fighting for the homeland, for taking part in the first summit of the Crimea Platform, which took place last year. Last year, he left the already occupied Crimea to tell the participants of the summit what is really happening on the peninsula and what it all will lead to. And nine days after his return to Crimea, the occupiers deprived him of his freedom. For the fact that he was simply a free man. This was Russia&#x27;s response. In his letter, Mr. Celâl wrote: &quot;It began with Crimea, and it will end with Crimea.&quot; And it really will. I believe in it. In order to overcome terror, to return predictability and security to our region, Europe and the whole world, we need to win the fight against Russian aggression, and therefore we need to free Crimea from occupation. It will end where it began. And this will be an effective resuscitation of the international legal order. But this is not just a political and legal task for the world. This is about a specific land, about specific people living in Crimea. About cities, about culture, about specific landmarks. About hopes of specific living people. About the fact that someone invested his life in Crimea, and after the arrival of Russia, was forced to leave it and seek refuge in other lands, or fear that something of his own would be taken away: a house, land, work, any business... And he was forced to limit himself. Or lose everything when it was taken. Russia stole a part of life even from those in Crimea who were lucky enough not to become a victim of repression. It was impossible to imagine such a thing, but the occupation turned Crimea - which is a paradise for all of us - into a depressed and dependent region. Into a region of high fences, barbed wire and lawlessness. Into a zone of environmental disaster and a military bridgehead for aggression and the spread of grief. Since February 24, 750 different cruise missiles have been launched from the occupied Crimea at our cities and communities. Imagine - 750 in six months! They destroyed at least hundreds of civilian objects: schools, universities, ordinary residential buildings, hospitals. And that is why Ukraine&#x27;s restoration of control over the Crimean peninsula will be a historic anti-war step in Europe. This will restore security and provide justice, this will reintegrate Crimea into the modern world, and this will allow each of us - participants of the Crimea Platform - to tell our children, our relatives and friends that they can be proud of us precisely as peacekeepers. And I want to emphasize: for Ukraine, Crimea is not just some territory, not a chip in the geopolitical game, as for a terrorist state. For Ukraine, Crimea is a part of our people, our society. A community of people to whom we will guarantee freedom and restore modernity. Crimea was and is Ukraine, and after deoccupation, along with our entire state, it will become part of the European Union. I am sure of that. The passport of a citizen of Ukraine will also be the passport of the European Union. These are colossal opportunities for all our people living in Crimea. The roads of Crimea will be the roads of the entire European continent, the ports of Crimea will be the ports of all of Europe. Only Ukraine can connect Simferopol with Berlin, and Yalta with Naples. Only Ukraine is concerned about the real security of Crimea. That is, a normal supply of clean water, normal disposal of garbage, effective rules for waste and sewage management. Only Ukraine can build a modern irrigation system in Crimea and integrate Crimean agricultural production and the entire business sector into the colossal European market. Only our state will provide Crimea with a modern and affordable medical system, a modern and affordable educational system, and a modern digital system of public services. Ukraine will remove the barbed wire that blocks the path of ordinary people to the best locations, and the illegal fences that have torn the coast of our beautiful Crimea. Free access to beaches, real protection of protected areas, historical sites - this will be provided only by Ukraine, not by someone who came to capture, steal and humiliate people. It is Ukraine that will restore the system of sanatoria and rehabilitation centers in Crimea - professional institutions that will be able to host hundreds of thousands of people annually. Millions of tourists. Children and adults, civilians and veterans, our citizens and foreigners - everyone whom the precious nature of Crimea helps. And millions of tourists - at least of the middle class - can come to Crimea stably only thanks to Ukraine. There will never be repressions under the Ukrainian authorities in Crimea, and everyone knows that. The lack of freedom or moral suffocation that Russia brought in 2014. And even more so, Ukraine will never ignore the social needs of pensioners or anyone else in Crimea. Ukraine will never tell people: &quot;There is no money, but hold on&quot;, because we respect people, and even this year, already in the bloody times of a full-scale war, we indexed pensions for all our pensioners. Ladies and Gentlemen! I think you felt from my words that we have a very elaborated view of how to restore our Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea after the expulsion of the Russian invaders. That is why we are adding two more directions to the work of the Crimea Platform: economic and legislative directions. We have a strategy for the restoration of Crimea - today it will be presented as part of the economic panel. And we are creating a legislative foundation for Crimea - after deoccupation, as well as for all those for whom Crimea is much more than even home. We adopted the Law &quot;On Indigenous Peoples&quot;, which protected the rights of the Crimean Tatar people and Mejlis, Karaites and Krymchaks. We are developing the Crimean Tatar language. A law was passed on the protection of political prisoners - all those who suffered from the repressions of the occupiers. And these are just some examples. We are not going to stop there - there is still a lot of work to do. This year, the Crimea Platform will be continued in the autumn - in Croatia - with a parliamentary summit. No longer online, with the presence of parliamentary delegations of the world. We use all the power of democracies to protect our state and the international legal order. And, returning to the letter of Nariman Celâl, who was imprisoned by the occupiers, I want to read a few more important words: &quot;Thanks to the change in the agenda on the world stage, in Europe and in Ukraine itself due to the aggression of the Russian Federation, the members of the Crimea Platform have a more determined attitude focused on the implementation of specific measures.&quot; The person who was sent to jail by the occupiers only for defending the truth and participating in last year&#x27;s Crimea Platform hopes for specific measures from all of us - participants of the summit. And we all must not deceive this hope. We all have to be strong and effective. Thank you for your attention! I am grateful to each and every one for participating in our second summit, to everyone present on this platform. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This day has shown how strong our state has become, and this is not the limit yet - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-23</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today was a useful day for Ukraine, very meaningful. A day that showed how strong our state has become, and this is not the limit yet. We are doing everything so that the strength of Ukraine, the opportunities of Ukraine, the freedom of Ukraine only increase. Today we celebrate the day of our flag, and it happens at a time when we are fighting against the most dreadful threat to our statehood and at the same time when we have achieved the greatest national unity. That is why we endured. Because we united and united the world around true values. Our national flag has become a global symbol of courage. A symbol of all who value a free life. Where there is blue and yellow, there is no and will be no tyranny. Where there is blue and yellow, there are no and will not be savages. Our flag is everywhere - from the frontline, where our warriors beat the enemy, to capitals on all continents, and it means one thing everywhere - humanity. I am grateful to everyone who defends true values. I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who, since February 24, has chosen the path of struggle for what makes life real: for freedom, for independence. Very soon we will celebrate our main national holiday - our independence. Already tomorrow. We have planned many activities - something that will emphasize the path we have covered. Covered together - Ukrainians in Ukraine, throughout our territory - free and temporarily occupied, because our people are fighting everywhere. Ukrainians abroad - all those who helped, all those who spread the truth about Ukraine, all those who urged to fight for Ukraine. No occupier feels safe on our land. All collaborators know that they have no future. And we all do not just believe - we see that our state has a perspective. And for tomorrow, I have planned to award people who have contributed to our strength. These are people from different areas of life. Our warriors, all those who help warriors. Communication officers, railwaymen, rescuers, media workers, those who inform our people, who work in the national marathon &quot;United News&quot;. These are utility workers, electricians, drivers, volunteers, officials, athletes, artists - those artists who are known on the frontline, whom the army is grateful to, those who preserve and restore the positive emotions of our warriors. I asked various ministries, regional administrations, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, media representatives to submit their proposals on who deserves awards on Independence Day. It is up to you to decide. And tomorrow the awards will be given to those who really deserve them. Now I am near the office of the Crimea Platform, near the building that symbolizes that we care about every part of Ukraine, about every part of our people - the great Ukrainian people. Crimea is an integral part of our state, Crimea is Ukraine. Crimea is an integral part of our people. And we will certainly come to our cities in Crimea, to our people in Crimea and return to them the freedom that belongs to them by right, as well as to all our other people. That is why we have organized a special format - the Crimean format, the Crimea Platform. We held the inaugural summit last summer and today we have already held the second one. I am grateful to all participants of the summit - 40 leaders, almost 60 states and international organizations. European leaders, leaders of the G7, leaders of the countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America. This is not just a meeting, not just a discussion. The Crimea Platform became a global forum that united the leaders of the free world. This is a community of people who help restore peace and legality for Crimea, for the Black Sea region, for all of Europe. And the fact that we are holding the summit for the second time right now, with the expansion of the representation, is a clear response of the world to Russian aggression. Clear support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders. Russian aggression began in Crimea, and its finale will be in Crimea as well. In Kyiv, on Constitution Square, the Walk of the Brave was opened today - a place to honor the personal strength of those people who did not fail after February 24, who were not afraid, who did not retreat under the pressure of tyranny. Who helped us fight against Russian aggression and is still helping us. And the first name that we presented on the Walk of the Brave is the name of Andrzej Duda, the President of Poland. He was in Kyiv today, participating in the Crimea Platform. And for not a single day during these six months has he lost strength in supporting Ukraine. I am grateful to him! I definitely want to address our Kharkiv and all Kharkiv residents separately today. You are heroic people, a heroic city. A proud city. A city with a sense of self-respect. A city that knows how to defend itself. A city whose people know how to unite. A neat city. A city that always impresses everyone who comes and sees how Kharkiv residents take care of their streets and yards even when they are under the brutal pressure of Russian terrorists. Today is Kharkiv Day. Now our Kharkiv is not willing to celebrate. Yes, Kharkiv experienced a lot of injustice and cruelty. But Kharkiv will never be a city of black scorched windows and ruined districts. Kharkiv will never submit to this evil, which has nothing but artillery and missiles. We will definitely liberate the entire Kharkiv region. We will find a way to guarantee security to our Kharkiv. And we will do everything to restore the city. I promise! Fellow Ukrainians! Tomorrow is an important day for all of us. And that is why this day, unfortunately, is also important for our enemy. We must be aware that tomorrow hideous Russian provocations and brutal strikes are possible. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, special services will do everything to protect people - as much as possible. And we will certainly respond to any manifestation of Russian terror. But please follow the safety rules strictly tomorrow. Please observe the curfew. Pay attention to the air sirens. Pay attention to official announcements. And remember: we must all achieve victory together. Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Independence Day of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-24</span></div>
  <p>The free people of independent Ukraine! And that says it all. Just four words, but how much is behind them today. On the 182nd day of the full-scale war. How many symbols and meanings, feats and losses, joy and pain are in these words. And mainly how much truth is in them. Our truth. Truth about our present, with which it is impossible to argue, as it is impossible not to see and not to admit. We are the free people of independent Ukraine. After six months of the attempts to destroy us, we are the free people of independent Ukraine. And this is the truth about our future. The free people of independent Ukraine. Six months ago, Russia declared war against us. On February 24, the entire Ukraine heard explosions and gunshots. And on August 24, it wasn’t supposed to hear the words &quot;Happy Independence Day&quot;. On February 24, we were told: you have no chance. On August 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine! During these six months, we changed history, changed the world and changed ourselves. Now we know for sure who is really our brother and friend, and who is not even a casual acquaintance. Who did not lose his name and reputation, and who worried for the terrorists to save face. Who doesn&#x27;t really need us, and where the door is really open for us. We understood who is who. And the whole world learned who Ukrainians are. What Ukraine is. No one will say about it anymore: it is somewhere over there, near Russia. We started to respect ourselves. We understood that despite any help and support, no one but us will fight for our independence. And we united. We didn&#x27;t have HIMARS yet, but we had people willing to stop tanks with their bare hands. They were not ready to close the sky for us, but we had people willing to cover their native land with themselves. The Ukrainian people and their courage inspired the whole world. They gave humanity a new hope that justice has not completely left our cynical world. And it is still not force that wins in it, but truth. Not money, but values. Not oil, but people. Yesterday the world was not united. COVID-19 clearly showed: it&#x27;s every man for himself. Ukraine has changed this in six months. All world history textbooks will have a section &quot;Times when Ukraine united the world&quot;. When democracy grew teeth again. When tyranny receives an answer in the language it understands. Someone said: Europe is no longer a player. Weak, disunited, passive, sleepy. Ukraine invigorated the whole continent. Europe takes to the squares. Europe introduces tough sanctions. Europe unanimously recognizes that Ukraine is a future member of the European Union. Big business realized that money still smells. With blood, cinder, death. Corporations and brands are leaving the Russian market, and people have become more important than potential losses. Never before in the world has public opinion had such an influence on politicians. Today, people dictate trends and rules of behavior to the authorities. Being indifferent, inactive and slow is a shame. Being indecisive and too cautious is a shame. Speaking sluggishly, vaguely and too diplomatically is a shame. Not supporting Ukraine is a shame. And saying about fatigue from Ukraine is a shame. This is a very comfortable position: fatigue is a cover to close your eyes. And today we hear from world leaders and ordinary citizens: we will be with you until the end, until your victory. Dear people! We always paid tribute to all the fighters for independence, called this day the main holiday, and the blue-yellow flag - a shrine, put our hands to our hearts while singing the national anthem, and proudly said &quot;Glory to Ukraine!&quot; and &quot;Glory to Heroes!&quot;. On February 24, we had to prove our words with deeds. On this day, the second all-Ukrainian referendum actually took place. Again - the main question. Again - a decisive choice. But this time it was necessary to say &quot;yes&quot; to independence not in the ballot, but in the soul and conscience. Go not to the precinct, but to the military commissariat departments, the territorial defense units, the volunteer movement, the information troops or simply work steadily and conscientiously in your place, at full strength, for a common goal. We all changed. Someone was born again. As a person, individual, citizen, patriot, simply as a Ukrainian. And this, of course, is good news. Someone disappeared. Did not perish, did not die, but dissolved. As a person, individual, citizen, as a Ukrainian. And this is actually not bad news either. We will not hinder each other anymore. We made a choice. For some, it is Mariupol. For some - Monaco. But we know who the majority is. And we finally became truly one. A new nation that emerged on February 24 at 4 am. Not born, but reborn. A nation that didn&#x27;t cry, didn&#x27;t scream, didn&#x27;t get scared. Didn&#x27;t run away. Didn&#x27;t give up. Didn&#x27;t forget. This flag will be everywhere it should be by right. Both in Donbas and in Crimea. The enemy thought we would greet him with flowers and champagne. Instead, he received wreaths and Molotov cocktails. He was waiting for an ovation, but hears &quot;claps&quot;. The occupier believed that in a few days he would be on parade in our capital’s downtown. Today, you can see this &quot;parade&quot; on Khreshchatyk. The proof that enemy equipment can appear in the center of Kyiv only in such form. Burnt, wrecked and destroyed. It doesn&#x27;t matter to us what kind of army you have, what matters to us is our land. We will fight for it until the end. We are holding on for six months. It is difficult for us, but we clenched our fists fighting for our fate. Every new day is a new reason not to give up. Because, having gone through so much, we have no right not to reach the end. What is the end of the war for us? We used to say: peace. Now we say: victory. We will not seek an understanding with the terrorists. Although we understand the Russian language that you came to defend. And killed thousands of people you came to liberate. And Johnson, who speaks English, is much more understandable and close to us than murderers, rapists and looters who did it in Russian. And we don&#x27;t sit down at the negotiating table because of fear, with a gun pointed at our head. For us, the most terrible iron is not missiles, aircraft and tanks, but shackles. Not trenches, but fetters. And we will put our hands up only once - when we will celebrate our victory. The whole of Ukraine. Because we do not trade our lands and our people. For us, Ukraine is all of Ukraine. All 25 regions, without any concessions or compromises. We do not know these words, they were destroyed by missiles on February 24. Donbas is Ukraine. And we will return it, whatever the path may be. Crimea is Ukraine. And we will return it. Whatever the path may be. You don&#x27;t want your soldiers to die? Free our lands. You don&#x27;t want your mothers to cry? Free our lands. These are our simple and clear terms. The free people of independent Ukraine! We are facing this day in different places. Someone is in trenches and dugouts, in tanks and IFVs, at sea and in the air. Fighting for independence on the frontline. Someone is on the road, in cars, trucks and trains. Fighting for independence by delivering what is necessary to those on the frontline. And someone is on a smartphone or on a computer. Also fighting for independence by raising funds so that those on the road have something to bring to those on the frontline. We are facing this day in different circumstances, conditions and even in different time zones, but with one goal - preservation of independence and victory of Ukraine! We united. Happy Independence Day of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We all have to make Russia recognize that the inviolability of borders and peace are unconditional values for all nations - speech by the President of Ukraine at the meeting of the UN Security Council</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-24</span></div>
  <p>I am thankful to everyone present for this opportunity, for your support! Greetings from independent and free Ukraine! But from Ukraine, which is still forced to fight for its freedom against Russian terror. Just now, on my way to deliver this address, I received information about a Russian missile attack on the Dnipropetrovsk region, on the railway station, directly on the cars at the Chaplyne station, four passenger cars are on fire... As of now, at least 15 people have been killed, about 50 have been wounded. Rescuers are working. But, unfortunately, the number of dead may still increase. This is how we live every day. This is how Russia prepared for this meeting of the UN Security Council. Ladies and Gentlemen! Mr. President! Mr. Secretary-General! Dear members of the UN Security Council - all those who respect and adhere to the UN Charter! Today, our state celebrates the main national holiday - Independence Day. And now you all see how many things in the world are dependent precisely on the independence of our state, on whether Ukraine is at peace, whether our people are safe, whether the integrity of our territory and the inviolability of our borders are guaranteed. You can take any aspect of the terrible war that Russia has unleashed against us, and in every such aspect there will be the roots of one global crisis or another. What exactly is happening now? Russia has put the world on the brink of a radiation disaster. It is a fact that the Russian military made the territory of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe - the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - a combat zone. This is a fact. Because of Russia&#x27;s armed provocations, because of shelling, because of the deployment of terrorists under the Russian flag on the territory of the plant. Now all of Europe and all neighboring regions are under the threat of radiation pollution. This is a fact. Who among you has forgotten what Chornobyl is? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant consists of six reactors. One reactor exploded in Chornobyl. The IAEA mission must take permanent control of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as soon as possible, and Russia must unconditionally stop nuclear blackmail and completely leave the plant. Russia has put the world on the brink of an unprecedented famine. It is a fact that the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov has increased the deficit in the already destabilized food market. And this is against the background of the terrible climatic situation in different parts of the planet - you can take the drought in Europe alone, the largest in 500 years. Fortunately, we managed to achieve such conditions under which Russia was forced to accept the terms of the international community, and thanks to this, grain exports from three Ukrainian ports were restored. This already relieves part of the tension in the food market, but does not remove the threat completely. Only the full recovery of Ukrainian agricultural exports without any obstacles can be a guarantee that tens of millions of people around the world will have something to eat. And don&#x27;t you resent the fact that even now, in the XXI century, we still have to fight to save tens of millions of people in different countries from artificial famine, precisely artificial famine, which was provoked by one state with its insane aggression? And this is also a fact. Ukrainians are outraged. The UN was not created to discuss in the XXI century something that should have long remained in the past. But, nevertheless, I am thankful to the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, and Türkiye, Mr. President, as well as all other conscientious subjects of international relations who are fighting against the food crisis, which only Russia is responsible for. And in the coming weeks, we must do everything to expand the existing grain export initiative. Let’s take another aspect - energy. It is a fact that Russia is deliberately trying to bring tens of millions of people into energy poverty. Deprive them of normal access to basic goods by deliberately raising energy prices. And this is done by a permanent member of the UN Security Council, who still has the privilege of veto! Energy crisis for Europe, threat of large-scale famine, political chaos for African and Asian countries, price crisis for the whole world. Isn’t too much allowed to one state, whose representative is sitting among you? And I will mention one more aspect - values. Yes, indeed, we should be honest about the fact that values are perceived differently in different parts of the world. They look at it differently. But everywhere in the world, life has value. Peace has value. Economic prosperity has value. All states, if they respect themselves and their people, punish murder and do not honor torturers. However, we see that there is a state that not just behaves differently, but that is proud to behave differently. It awards murderers, encourages torturers. And this is a threat not only for Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed by the Russian invaders. Dozens of our cities were destroyed by Russian artillery. Russia does not adhere to basic conventions regarding prisoners of war. This was also discussed today. The deliberate murder by the Russian occupiers of our prisoners of war in Olenivka became one of the most dreadful pages in the history of Europe. And there is an urgent need for a UN fact-finding mission to Olenivka, whose mandate should be extended to all Ukrainian prisoners of war currently held by Russian forces. There is no war crime that the Russian occupiers have not yet committed on the territory of our independent state. But if we do not stop Russia now in Ukraine, if we do not stop it with the victory of Ukraine, all these Russian murderers will inevitably end up in other countries. Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America - traces of Russian war criminals are everywhere already, and we must all unite and act as resolutely as possible so that there are no more traces of Russian missiles and cities burned by Russian artillery anywhere else. So that there is never again a threat of a radiation disaster, Russia must leave the occupied territory of Ukraine. So that there is never a food crisis again, Russia must leave our land and our sea. So that no country in the world can ever again disregard the UN Charter and conventions binding on all mankind, without exception for anyone - Russia must be held accountable for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. The relevant resolution will be submitted for consideration by the 77th session of the UN General Assembly. In order for a sense of justice to return to international relations, we must all confirm and force Russia to recognize that the inviolability of borders and peace are unconditional values for all nations. That is why the independence and integrity of our state are of fundamental importance for international relations. Preserving our independence, guaranteeing our security, returning normal economic ties with Ukraine will restore the true power of the UN Charter and save the world from the crises we are all forced to experience now. Mr. Secretary-General, Distinguished António Guterres, has the ambitious intention of organizing the Summit of the Future next year. We support this intention. And we emphasize: in order to build the future, it is necessary to leave in the trashbox of history what has always prevented humanity from living in peace, namely aggression and colonial ambitions. That is, what Russia came to Ukraine with. And I believe that we will really be able to build the future. It would be very nice and symbolic for such a Summit to take place in Ukraine. As it is on our territory, on the territory of Ukraine, that it is now being decided whether we will have a future at all, whether the world will have a future at all. This is being decided at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, in our seaports, in Donbas and in Crimea. Our independence is your security. The security of the entire free world. I thank you very much for this opportunity, for understanding my situation, the situation of our country. Thank you! I am grateful to the Chinese Presidency for the opportunity to participate in this meeting in an online format. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>There are no such missiles that can break the will of the people who believe in themselves - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-24</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! It&#x27;s almost night, our main day, Independence Day of Ukraine, is coming to an end. But our independence does not end and will never end. And there will be our 32nd Independence Day, and 33rd, and all the following ones, as long as time on earth lasts. Ukraine will live forever. And it will only get stronger every day. And absolutely everyone in the world understands this - from the UN Security Council to all capitals without exception. Therefore, let&#x27;s not retreat from our path, let&#x27;s fight, express gratitude to everyone who supports us, take care of our state, preserve our unity - the same unity as today, as every day over these six months. And no enemy will be able to defeat us. There are no such bombs that can erase freedom, and there will never be such missiles that can break the will of the people who believe in themselves. Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died, a Russian missile destroyed his house. Search and rescue operations at the railway station will continue. We will definitely make the occupiers bear responsibility for everything they have done. And we will certainly drive the invaders out of our land. Not a single stain of this evil will remain in our free Ukraine. We will make our way to victory! It will happen! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by these invaders, these enemies. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Glory to our people! Glory to our Ukrainian strong world, our independence, our nation! Glory to all of you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans one step away from a radiation disaster - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-25</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All Europeans! Today, for the first time in history, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant stopped. The emergency protection of the power units worked - after the last working line of the plant&#x27;s power return to the Ukrainian power system was damaged by Russian shelling. Diesel generators were immediately activated to provide energy to the plant itself, to support it after the shutdown. The world must understand what a threat this is: if the diesel generators hadn’t turned on, if the automation and our staff of the plant had not reacted after the blackout, then we would already be forced to overcome the consequences of the radiation accident. Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster. The south of Ukraine - the occupied areas - is already in a state of humanitarian disaster. In addition to all the evil that the occupiers brought there, electricity, water and sewage were cut off. Russia has brought degradation to our land, which has never been seen here. All this was simply impossible before the occupation. But this is the essence and pride of the modern Russian state: it is capable of only one thing - making the worst possible. I want to assure all Ukrainians: we are doing everything to prevent an emergency scenario. But it depends not only on our state. The key thing is that such international pressure is needed that will force the occupiers to immediately withdraw from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The IAEA and other international organizations must act much faster than they’re acting now. Because every minute the Russian troops stay at the nuclear power plant is a risk of a global radiation disaster. Of course, we are doing everything so that the world knows every detail of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. And, in particular, today I talked about it in detail with President of the United States of America Biden. I am grateful to him for understanding and fully supporting the need to return the plant under the Ukrainian control and provide for the IAEA access immediately. This can be done in a matter of days, before the occupiers bring the situation to an irreversible point. And it&#x27;s easier to do it now than later, if the wind starts blowing radiation pollution across Europe. In general, our conversation with President Biden today was very constructive, positive, quite long and productive. We managed to discuss all issues that are of vital importance for the protection of Ukraine and freedom. I thanked Mr. President and all the people of the United States for the defense assistance and for the tangible leadership in the macro-financial support of our state. Just yesterday, President Biden approved a $6 billion package: three for defense assistance, three for financial assistance through the World Bank system. I expressed particular gratitude for the inclusion of air defense in this package. We can really achieve a situation when the Russian missile terror will be overcome after Ukraine receives NASAMS air defense systems. Today, I also had a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy who was on a visit to Ukraine. I thanked the Italian people, the President of Italy and personally Prime Minister of Italy Draghi for his principles in the defense of a united Europe. Mr. Draghi became one of those European leaders whose determination and personal morality made it possible at a critical moment to strengthen Europe and protect normal life on our continent. We discussed today the expansion of cooperation between our states and Italy&#x27;s experience in strengthening security, in particular energy security. By the way, due to Russian gas blackmail, gas prices in Europe today have already exceeded the level of $3,300 per thousand cubic meters. And this Russian anti-European policy is truly destructive, but in a strategic perspective – for Russia itself. There will no longer be such a player on the European energy market as Russia. Of course, now the situation is very dangerous, very acute. But most European countries have approached energy issues very responsibly and are doing everything to adapt, to protect themselves. If someone in Russia thinks that they will bring Europe as a whole or Ukraine or other individual countries to their knees this winter, then this is a miscalculation. I believe that Europe is strong enough to correct the mistakes of the past, to become independent from the Russian energy system, from Russian energy carriers and not to give in to the blackmail of energy terrorists from Gazprom. Ukraine is closely coordinating actions with its partners in these issues as well - in energy issues. The Government of Ukraine, our state-owned companies are doing everything to ensure that we are ready to go through this winter season, which will indeed be the most difficult in our history. And we are now in such circumstances, when it is already clear that the enemy will not achieve its goals, but it still takes time, efforts are still needed for the Russian calculation to fail, so that they lose in this direction as well. We have to endure this time and make all the necessary efforts together with our partners. And so it will be. We will put pressure on terrorists on all fronts - on the frontline, on the political front, in economic matters, in the information sphere. For every shelling, there will be a response to the occupiers. It will be for Orikhiv. It will be for Chaplyne. It will be for Shepetivka, for Myrhorod, for Kharkiv, for Mariupol and the cities of Donbas, for all others who are targeted by the Russian military. Russia has prepared many problems, crises and catastrophes for our country, for Europe and for the world. But the greatest disaster will still be experienced by it itself, the terrorist state itself. This &quot;Titanic&quot; came to its iceberg on February 24, and no matter how hard they try to stay afloat, they won’t. Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom! Eternal glory to all our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Armed Forces of Ukraine, our people prove to occupiers every day that they have no chance to stay safe on Ukrainian land – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-26</span></div>
  <p>Good evening, Ukrainians! Europeans! Our nuclear scientists, all specialists in the energy industry, manage to protect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the worst-case scenario, which is constantly being provoked by Russian forces. Currently, the plant has been connected to the grid. My congratulations. It produces power for Ukraine. I want to emphasize that the situation remains very risky and dangerous. Any repeat of yesterday&#x27;s events, that is, any disconnection of the plant from the grid, any actions by Russia that could trigger the shutdown of the reactors, will again put the plant one step away from disaster. That is why it is so important that the IAEA mission arrives at the plant as soon as possible and helps keep the NPP under continuous control of Ukraine. That is why it is so important that Russian troops withdraw from the plant and neighboring areas and that the threat of shelling of the plant itself or power lines connected to it disappears. Ukrainian diplomats and our partners continue to fight for the safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP every day. And today I want to thank all those who are mobilizing the world&#x27;s response to Russian radiation blackmail. To all our nuclear scientists – you are great, you are cool! To all our engineers – you are strong – whose professionalism is now literally saving both Ukraine and Europe when they overcome the consequences of Russian terror at the plant! Today, we can draw the first conclusions about the rescue of many countries and peoples from the food crisis, which Russia wanted so badly to exacerbate into real famine. The grain export initiative has been operating for almost a month, and during this time, the first million tonnes of foodstuffs were exported from our three seaports in Chornomorsk, Odesa and Yuzhne since February 24. This is a victory. This means in practice that Ukrainian grain and the very fact that the Ukrainian supply route to the world food market has worked, make it possible to prevent chaos on the market, reduce the severity of the food crisis and prevent a catastrophic shortage. Ukraine was, is and will be among the guarantors of global food security. By the way, 44 vessels with Ukrainian foodstuffs have already been sent to 15 countries of the world, we have 70 more applications for the arrival of vessels at ports for loading. The goal is to reach the volume of 3 million tonnes of export by sea every month. And this is extremely important for Africa, Asia and Europe. It is also important that our society realizes that this export not only supports the international subject status of Ukraine, but also provides jobs for our citizens – it is hundreds of thousands of jobs, it provides income for Ukrainian companies, for our budget and, what is very important, it provides funds for planting next year. I still remember the joy of port workers in Odesa, when they not only learned, but actually saw that the port had resumed operations. This is a really important result for Ukraine, for the Black Sea region and for the whole world. And I am grateful to everyone who joined this work, this initiative. I emphasize that it is the full responsibility of the partners to prevent any Russian provocations and disruption of exports. We continue mobilizing media support for Ukraine. Now it is time that we need to look for even more non-standard channels for spreading the truth about Russia&#x27;s war against you and us, about our independence, about the needs of our state. We constantly find new information friends – real friends – partners in the defense of freedom and in countering Russian disinformation. Yes, today I spoke with Jimmy Fallon – a very famous American talk show host, actor – about options for how to draw attention to Ukraine, how to convey the truth to the United States, to the people. How can we still help Ukraine? It was his main question. The question is how to win in this information war against the lies of the Russian Federation. The situation on the front line remains unchanged these days. Our soldiers are doing everything possible to reduce the firepower and logistical potential of the occupiers. I think you all see the relevant news – about the destruction of the bases of the occupiers, their warehouses, those river crossings that they use. And the more successful we will be in this – our intelligence, our army, the Security Service of Ukraine – the sooner we will be able to change the situation at the front in our favor. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, all our people, prove to the Russian occupiers every day that they do not have and will not have a chance to stay safe on Ukrainian land. The day will come when the occupiers will admit it. Or there simply won&#x27;t be any left. Eternal glory to all of you, defenders of our state! Eternal glory to our strong, indomitable, wise, beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today I thank all our pilots who are doing a lot to bring the victory of Ukraine closer – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-27</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health! Today is Aviation Day. It is traditionally celebrated in our country on the last Saturday of August. It is a professional holiday of people without whom the present cannot be imagined. And without which we cannot imagine the independence of our state. Russia hoped to destroy our aircraft in the first hours of the full-scale invasion. And, of course, this enemy had a completely insane goal, like many other such goals. The Air Force of Ukraine was preserved, and since the first day of the invasion, it has been honorably performing combat missions. In six months, 18 pilots were honored with the title of Hero of Ukraine. Dozens more have been given state awards. Their skills and combat results have become a true legend, and I have repeatedly heard the highest praise of our aviation from representatives of the armies and states of our partners. Ukrainian aviation is strong. It will be among the most modern, that&#x27;s for sure. This cannot be changed. But even in the extremely difficult conditions that exist now, Ukrainian pilots show the greatest skills. Today I thank all our pilots, everyone who services flights, prepares equipment for flights, and everyone who helps Ukrainian military aviation to be able to perform combat missions. And separately, I want to thank the parents of our soldiers, mothers and fathers of Ukrainian pilots, for such brave and intelligent sons who did and are doing a lot to bring our victory – the victory of Ukraine – closer. Once again – Happy Aviation Day of Ukraine! This week, for the Independence Day of our country, I signed a number of decrees on awarding representatives of various professions, various groups of our society. In general, those who really helped the defense of Ukraine, the defense of independence, our people, and who are really known at the front. I asked the military and law enforcement officers, all authorities – central and regional, ministries and regional administrations, as well as representatives of the media – to provide me with nominations of those who deserve awards. Those in the trenches, those who support our boys and girls. Name the people they know in the army, whom they are truly grateful to on the front lines. Who support the fighting spirit of Ukrainians, our faith in ourselves, who spread the truth about the war. Who are mobilizing assistance for Ukraine abroad. Who support the displaced people... Volunteers and officials, journalists and workers of utility service enterprises, communications operators, transport workers and athletes, artists, musicians, public figures, workers of the energy industry, post office... Many different people whose candidacies were proposed. There are also those who are awarded, unfortunately, posthumously. Of course, I also signed decrees on awarding our soldiers – in the Armed Forces, in intelligence, in the Security Service of Ukraine. In total, since February 24, 27,760 of our defenders have been given state awards of Ukraine. Tomorrow, on Sunday, these decrees will be made public. And there will be another decree – a very important, special decree – on awarding state awards to friends of Ukraine abroad, our partners, our helpers in the struggle for freedom and life. Those whose contribution is really significant. Those to whom Ukraine will always be grateful. Because the struggle for independence is the struggle of the entire nation, and only in this way it can be successful. It is nationwide here in Ukraine. And that is why Ukraine will win. The people always win. And the successful struggle for freedom in the world also cannot be the struggle of only individual people or individual states. It is a joint work, a common result, which is achieved thanks to the strength and solidarity of all who value freedom and who do not tolerate tyranny. Freedom always wins. We will definitely win! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal gratitude to everyone who helps fight for freedom, for our state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We have not forgotten and will not forget any of our cities and any of our people – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-28</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Every year, on the last weekend of summer, two holidays were celebrated in our country – they are closely related – Donetsk City Day and Miner&#x27;s Day. In 2014, everything changed for Donetsk because of the occupiers. And this year, all of Ukraine will not have holidays. But we have not forgotten and will not forget any of our cities and any of our people. Donetsk has always been one of the richest and strongest cities in Ukraine. Mining has always been one of the most respected professions. Now Donbas is almost destroyed by Russian strikes, devastated. The proud and glorious Ukrainian Donetsk was humiliated by the Russian occupation and robbed. Russia brought the most terrible thing there – absolute disregard for the value of any life, absolute disrespect for anyone. The invaders brought degradation and death. And they believe that they are there forever. But it&#x27;s a temporary thing for them. And Ukraine will return. For sure. Life will return. The dignity of the people of Donbas will return. The ability to live will return. The opportunity to live safely and happily. This is exactly what our Ukrainian flag will symbolize when we set it up in Donetsk, Horlivka, Mariupol, in all cities of Donbas, Azov area, in all areas under Russian occupation – in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions. And definitely – in Crimea. Ukraine remembers everything. I held a meeting today with representatives of the defense and security sector. It was attended by the heads of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other structures and areas of defense of our state. All the issues we considered are important, but secret, I cannot go into detail. But the occupiers will feel its consequences – in the further actions of our defenders. No terrorist will go unanswered for attacks on our cities. Zaporizhzhia, Orikhiv, Kharkiv, Donbas – they will receive an answer for all of them. We are preparing for a new week – it will be very active. Important visits of partners to Ukraine are planned. I will resume the practice of appeals to the states and nations that support us. And most importantly, we are working to ensure that there are new restrictions for Russia because of the war and that there are new support packages for our defenders, for our state. Defense support – weapons and ammunition, financial support, political support, media support, support for our reconstruction – every day every public official must demonstrate results in his area of responsibility. Only work for results gives the right to hold public positions. This should be remembered by everyone who was given power. Thank you to everyone who honestly works for the state! Thanks to all our defenders! Glory to our soldiers! Glory to our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Energy independence from Russia is of fundamental importance for all Europeans, and only together can we protect Europe – speech by the President of Ukraine at the Offshore Northern Seas Conference 2022</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-29</span></div>
  <p>Your Royal Highness, Mr. Prime Minister! Dear businessmen present! Dear Mr. Elon Musk! Dear friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful to each and every one of you who is present for the opportunity to talk and for the opportunity to participate in this important discussion. I&#x27;m sure you are well informed about the situation in Europe, about the risks - I heard you talked about them now - that we all face now in addition to the brutal terrorist war that Russia is waging against our citizens, our state, against our independence. And it is important to know that this is the independence of all other European states. This is a war for independence as such. We all see how destabilized the gas market is. We all see how European countries are revising their plans for coal, coal-fired power plants. We can all see that the threat of energy poverty is becoming real for tens of millions of people in Europe, who until recently could afford normal energy consumption. We all see that the price of energy is so high that thousands of businesses have gone into crisis. And this leads to a reduction in jobs and a drop in workers&#x27; incomes. And in winter, energy prices can rise even more... We all see that for the first time since 1986, when the Chornobyl tragedy occurred, we have to consider as seriously as possible the scenarios for countering the radiation disaster that Russia is bringing closer with its terror at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. These are all well-known facts. But what do they testify to? People often draw completely different conclusions from the same facts - some are right, and some are wrong. In the discussions, the opinion of the majority is determined afterwards - either right or wrong. Sometimes mistakes leave no trace. And sometimes the price of mistakes becomes very high, when erroneous conclusions lead to erroneous political decisions. This is what the authors of this large-scale – and completely artificial – crisis that Europe is going through are counting on. They want the Europeans to be scared. To draw wrong conclusions and give up European values in favor of illusory price reductions. Russia is using economic terror, price crisis pressure and poverty to weaken Europe just when its full force is needed to defend against terror in the war that Russia has been waging for more than six months. Full-scale war! And in general, its invasion of Ukraine has already been lasting for 8 years. This is what the Russian state, its officials and companies, such as Gazprom, are working for. For creating crises and for crises to turn into disasters. Right now, Russia is burning at least 10 million euros worth of gas near the Finnish border every day. Gas is being burned that should have been supplied to German and other European consumers. Russia cannot stop its production, does not want to supply it to the Europeans, as it is interested in the crisis, and has no other buyers. So it just burns this gas. Just like they burn our people. 10 million euros on fire every day at the border of Russia is hundreds of millions of euros in additional expenses of the European middle class, ordinary workers, pensioners on energy every day as well. Because of the inflated prices on the market, because of the shortage, because of Russia trying to prevent the replenishment of European gas storages before winter. A normal market player would have already supplied the free volume of gas to the market. The terrorist state does everything to ensure that there is as little gas as possible on the market at the highest possible price, which leads to an increase in other prices. And this is all part of the Russian hybrid aggression against all people, against all of us, against all of you, against all of united Europe. And take a look at the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Why is Russia doing this? What is the purpose of the radiation blackmail for Russia? The goal is the same, completely cynical, completely deliberate - to intimidate Ukrainians, to intimidate all Europeans. To blackmail and coerce. This pressure is for Russian state propagandists and officials to say that it is allegedly not Russia to blame, that someone else created another crisis and that this someone should be influenced, and that it is allegedly necessary to negotiate with the Kremlin precisely for this reason. Just think about it: Russia is the only terrorist in the world who managed to turn a nuclear power plant into a battlefield and who consistently does everything to make Europe watch where the wind may blow the radiation if, God forbid, a disaster occurs. Most of the older generation of Norway, I think, well remember that the consequences of the accident at the Chornobyl plant were felt even in central Norway - in the area of Trondheim and in the north of your country. And for all of us, this is a terrible risk. This is a memory of the unacceptable, and for Russia it is just an additional opportunity. The fact is that the Russian leadership has a specific bandit’s logic - they create problems, hoping that the victims of these problems will come and try to agree on their solution, and the bandit will get something for it. Russia wants Europe to turn a blind eye to the war, and for this purpose it is provoking internal chaos in Europe. Russia wants to take away freedom from us by force of arms, and from you - by these crises that it creates and exacerbates. Russia wants to force you to abandon European values. Here is a correct conclusion from the available facts. And based on this conclusion, a correct policy is needed. The policy of even greater unity, as the Prime Minister has said now, unity in Europe for our common defense. The policy of even greater energy independence of Europe from Russia. The policy of even greater sanctions against Russia. It is not normal when there are still no blocking sanctions against Rosatom for radiation blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, for which specific Rosatom employees at the plant are also responsible. And it is not normal when any Russian citizen can get a visa to European countries to go on vacation or go shopping - we know this very well - even if he is a war criminal or helps the Russian state work against Europe. It is not normal when some European companies are still hesitant whether to leave the Russian market or not. And it is not normal when someone still hopes for cooperation with Russia in the energy sector. There can be no concessions to bandits! Only new sanction strikes against them. I want to give an example of Norway - an example of true principles in the defense of Europe. Despite the fact that Norway is not a member of the European Union, you joined the European sanctions against Russia. Defense and other assistance to our country from Norway is vital - we will always be grateful for it. We are glad to hear that your energy companies are increasing the volume of gas supplies to European countries, while Russia is willing to simply burn gas in order not to supply it. And we note Norway&#x27;s contribution to the development of renewable energy sources, to carbon capture and storage, to the development of batteries and hydrogen energy. Europe will become truly strong and secure from crises when all European countries become as principled as Norway. For its part, Ukraine can already do - and is doing - concrete things to protect our common values and normal life on the continent. We are fighting for freedom and for everything that Europe is based on, defending all Europeans in this war. And this is not pathos - this is the truth! We have united Europeans and helped overcome the various contradictions that have been dividing the continent for decades. We have shown what power Europe has when united and what enemies it can overcome. In addition, Ukraine can become - I believe it will become - one of the guarantors of the energy security of the European continent. Together with Ukraine, you will be able to prevent such price crises ever again. We have a unique system of gas storage facilities near the border of the European Union, with a volume of more than 30 billion cubic meters. We are asked about help. That&#x27;s how practical it is - use our gas storages already this season. Today, for example, we have a free volume of 15 billion cubic meters. Ukraine needs 3 billion of additional reserves, which we ask you to keep in Ukraine, and another 12 billion cubic meters may be the gas needed in winter for the security of all of Europe. You can help us - and this will be your help both to us and to yourself. Ukraine also has significant deposits of natural gas. The leadership of Russia dreamed of stealing this part of our national wealth from us as well. But we will not allow it. We invite all investors, contractors and service companies to join gas production in Ukraine. If you want to help us pragmatically, please use this tool. Obtain licenses, enter into agreements on the distribution of products, carry out exploration and drilling. We would appreciate it. Our gas fields can play the same stabilizing role for Europe as the fields of Norway in particular. We are preparing to increase the export of our electricity to the countries of the European Union - despite the war, during the war we ensure this export, and our electricity is much cheaper than what is currently available on the market. We can really help overcome the cost of living crisis in our neighboring EU countries. And we invite you to invest in the production of green energy and green hydrogen in Ukraine. Our state is one of the best locations for providing all of Europe with green energy and green hydrogen. We have everything for this – enough land, good wind, good sun, as well as ready-made energy logistics – powerful power transmission lines, gas pipelines that can be used for hydrogen – of course, after appropriate modernization. We are not saying for the first time that Europe&#x27;s independence from Russia, particularly in energy, is of fundamental importance to all Europeans. And we are not saying for the first time that Europe can do much more together with Ukraine than with Russia. We don&#x27;t want to look into the past, we don&#x27;t want to repeat who didn&#x27;t hear us. Ukraine wants us all not to lose the opportunities we have at this historical moment. Only together can we protect Europe. Only by preserving our maximum principles. And only by achieving victory in this war together. I thank you for your attention! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is important to do everything so that Russia can never again blackmail either Ukraine or France - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the annual meeting of French entrepreneurs under the auspices of the MEDEF business association</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President of the MEDEF! Dear ministers, dear MEDEF members! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful to you for the invitation, for this opportunity to address you, to address in your person the entire people of France - each and every one who believes that no one has the right to destroy someone&#x27;s life. I know that MEDEF unites and protects the interests of hundreds of thousands of businesses in France. You represent people who have created and who are developing businesses in different areas, completely different industries. You represent people who work hard to be able to provide for their children and exercise their rights. The right to live, the right to be free, the right to happiness, the right to well-being, the right to housing, the right to education, the right to work, the right to a decent wage and other absolutely common modern human rights. And in fact, your association represents the very people that I, as the President of Ukraine, represent. Our people wanted nothing more than to live in their own country, enjoy their freedoms, work for their own good and the future of their children. Ukraine did not go to someone else’s home with weapons. Ukrainians were not going to rob any other people or any state. We cared about our social development, our democracy and dreamed that one day we would be in the European Union together with you and other nations of Europe. And that is why this Russian war against Ukraine began. The leadership of Russia saw that Ukraine can become and is becoming a positive example for our region. An example that democracy can give more to society than dictatorship can. This seems to be an obvious opinion in Western Europe, but in the east of our continent, and especially in the territory of the former USSR, this is not an obvious fact, it needs to be proved. And Ukraine did everything to prove it. Our state set an example of how to take care of society without crazy dollars and euros earned from the sale of oil and gas. How to create opportunities for social development. How to strengthen the regions of the state, not drain money from them. How to build modern infrastructure. How to create such opportunities for citizens that others in our region simply do not have thanks to the openness of society and the modernity of state institutions. In particular, we conducted and continue to digitize public services. Our goal is to ensure that relations between a citizen and the state, between any company and the state take place without the mediation of a government official. This is a necessary condition for overcoming any risks of corruption and for the real freedom of people and business - something that dozens of other governments cannot dare to do. And this is something that every Ukrainian has in his smartphone today. This is &quot;Diia&quot; state service, which gives people dozens of different opportunities: from digital documents and vaccination certificates to the ability to register a business or pay fines. We combine our economy and energy sphere with the European market and other advanced world markets. We have deposits of natural resources that are critically important for the world economy, including lithium, titanium, uranium, etc. Ukraine has already become a guarantor of global food security. The value of our agrarian exports was fully demonstrated when Russia blocked Ukrainian ports, and as a result, the global food crisis aggravated. Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine is not just a colonial war in the worst sense of the word, it is not just an attempt to appropriate our land, resources or the potential of our people. Through the destruction of Ukraine, Russia is trying to destroy the hope of all nations near its borders and all peoples in the territory of Russia itself that freedom will really work. That democracy will help with development. That human rights and human dignity can give society more than the mercy of some dictator. That is why the Russian war against Ukraine is so brutal. That is why it became total from the first minute on February 24. That is why Russian cruise missiles and artillery destroy everything from day one. Everything that was built and developed by generations of Ukrainians. Schools and hospitals, universities, railway stations, airports, residential buildings of ordinary people, factories, bakeries, port facilities and even ordinary tire repair stations, ordinary shopping malls, machine-building plants, water plants, power plants - absolutely everything. Dropping a bomb on a maternity hospital, a theater or a warehouse with food is all the same to the Russian occupiers. All these are the same targets for them. Burning cities and making millions of people forcibly displaced are just tools for them. Because Russia&#x27;s goal is to destroy Ukraine as a democracy, a social state, an economic power, a society of educated people who know how to work for their own interests. Like all people. But that is why I believe in our victory. When someone is at war with an entire nation, he has no chance. For us, this is a people&#x27;s war. And nations are invincible! And when the nation has such friends like the Ukrainians have, victory becomes inevitable. I am sincerely grateful to you, the people of France, and I am personally grateful to President Emmanuel Macron for support in this fight for freedom. I saw how Emmanuel was looking for a diplomatic way, looking for steps to stop the war. I have devoted several years as president to finding a solution, a peaceful, diplomatic model of coexistence without war. But, unfortunately, the leadership of Russia does not want to live without war. The leadership of Russia considers the free and democratic life of Ukraine as an existential challenge for itself. That is why they want war and destruction. They think that this way they can secure their dictatorship for many years. And that is why it is important to achieve victory. It is important to do everything so that the victory takes place as soon as possible. It is important to do everything so that Russia can never again blackmail either Ukraine or France. You don&#x27;t feel it as much as we do yet. And hopefully the war will not come to your land, but this is it. All this is their plan. Neither any European state, nor Europe in general can be blackmailed with a war, an energy crisis or a food crisis. It is important to rebuild Ukraine after the war. Peace for Ukraine, guarantees of security, restoration of everything destroyed by the Russian occupiers will be clear proof that the European idea is stronger than any dictatorships, and the values of freedom, equality and mutual aid overcome any terror. And that is why I am addressing you today. Ukraine can give you thousands of contracts, thousands of jobs. We need your experience and your participation in post-war reconstruction. We have already started - on the free territory of our country. We invite construction companies to take part in infrastructure reconstruction, localization of production of construction materials. We invite companies that can help in the modernization of communal infrastructure - water supply, water purification, waste sorting and processing. We invite energy companies to produce and store gas, build green energy, produce hydrogen and develop our nuclear energy industry. We invite automotive companies to localize the production of electric cars and components. We invite food companies to engage in agro-processing and food production for the 40-million market of Ukraine and the entire European market with which we are fully integrated. And we will come to the entire territory of our country currently occupied by Russia in order to return this territory to Europe. Perhaps some of you already know that at the level of our Governments - Ukraine and France - we are preparing to hold such an initiative in Paris in the autumn - a forum on the recovery of Ukraine. I invite your companies to participate in this initiative. I know that there are companies that have already responded and are participating in the reconstruction of our state. In particular, I am grateful to Matière company for its support in the restoration of our bridge infrastructure. I would also like to thank the Île-de-France region for starting a partnership with the Chernihiv and Kyiv regions, and the Grand-Est region for a partnership with the Kharkiv region. And I am also grateful to all other small and large cities of France, which came to the aid of Ukraine in this important, cruel time. I remember how last year, even before the start of the full-scale war, we met in Kyiv with the MEDEF delegation. Good ideas and ambitious projects were discussed. I want to confirm - we will be able to implement them, we will be able to do a lot together. Because we equally value freedom, equally respect human rights, equally care about social development. We are all people, we are all Europeans, and that says it all! Thank you for your attention! Thanks, France, for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>European countries and the entire free world should encourage Russian citizens to fight for a change in Russian policy – address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Bled Strategic Forum (Slovenia)</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-29</span></div>
  <p>Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants of the Forum! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and everyone present, as well as all Europeans! Today is an important day for us - the Day of Remembrance of the Defenders of Ukraine who died in the struggle for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. At this time, in August 2014, Ukrainian warriors were vilely killed near the city of Ilovaisk in Donbas. They were brutally shot by Russian troops. Ukraine lost hundreds of its sons then - in a few days. Hundreds of those thousands perished in the war since 2014. In the war that reached the scale of a total war on February 24 of this year. Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against the life and freedom of our people, against ordinary peaceful cities that are being destroyed by Russian artillery, and against the culture of our people, which Russia wants to completely erase - Russian propagandists and officials do not even conceal this goal, they say absolutely openly that they want to destroy everything Ukrainian. So that it does not exist. They do not perceive the very fact of the independent existence of our people. Like any of your people. As we repel Russian aggression on our soil, we protect every European people from exactly the same expansion - the expansion of those who have nothing human left in them. Is there any human in someone who rapes children in front of their parents? In the one who forces the inhabitants of the entire village - everyone from small children to the elderly - to sit in the basement of the school for a month? Is there any human in someone who strikes heavy anti-ship missiles, which were built to destroy aircraft carriers, at an ordinary shopping mall full of people. In the one who supplies shells to the artillery, which day after day burns city blocks, ordinary residential buildings. In the one who interrogates and tortures people in the so-called filtration camps created by Russian forces throughout the occupied territory. Imagine: XXI century, filtration camps. Is there any human in someone who separates Ukrainian children from their parents and gives them for criminal adoption in Russia knowing that these children have relatives in Ukraine. Relatives who are alive and who are looking for them. When we talk about Russian aggression against Ukraine and all of Russia&#x27;s pressure on Europe accompanying this aggression - and this is very cynical pressure, this is the deliberate destruction of normal economic and social life, this is the energy and price crises in Europe, which are artificially exacerbated by Russia - when we talk about all this, we mean not only those who are at the highest levels of the Russian power hierarchy. We are talking about thousands and thousands of different people with the passport of a Russian citizen. About those who shoot at our soldiers on the battlefield and shoot civilians in the back of the head. We are talking about those who press the buttons to strike Russian missiles at Ukrainian cities. About those who design and manufacture these missiles and other weapons used for terror. Those who work in companies that provide for the Russian army and special services. Those who conscript, transport and in every way support Russian murderers. We are talking about those who provide for corrupt Russian officials and generals, who manage numerous businesses that are related to corrupt Russian officials. Those who sow hatred for any manifestation of freedom, promote war, support repression. Those who remain silent when they see all this and do nothing - do not protest, do not fight - even when they are completely safe in European countries. Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014. For more than six months, the Russian state has been spending all its available resources to destroy our state and split Europe. Most European countries have already seen and experienced one or another of Russia&#x27;s attempts to put pressure, inflict damage and bring suffering to people. And according to the logic of any normal person, it is the citizens of Russia who have something human left in them who should be the first to oppose the war. If they have conscience, if they have shame. But we do not see constant and noticeable anti-war protests with the participation of citizens of this state - even where there is no risk for them of any repression for protests, I repeat this once again. Why so? I&#x27;ll leave you with that question. It is complicated - so why is it so? Europe is not a quiet haven where you can just sit out the time when someone else is fighting against Russian terror. But, unfortunately, many citizens of Russia perceive Europe this way. That is why they need European visas. And, unfortunately, none of your states is immune from the fact that war criminals, on whose hands there is the blood of Ukrainians, will come to you simply as tourists, and one day they will receive an order - and they will become not tourists at all. It shouldn&#x27;t be like that. And all of us in Europe have to protect ourselves from this. Both those who are part of the European Union and all other European countries. Because Russian terror is an equal threat to all of us, to all who live here, to all European nations. The one who does not fight against terror supports it, and therefore shares the responsibility for all its consequences. This should be the rule that overrides all other rules. A state that threatens everyone around it - from the Baltic states to Kazakhstan - should be under a full embargo from everyone in the world who values freedom and respects themselves. We need an embargo on all relations with Russia, with a terrorist state, as long as Russia continues the war, occupies foreign territory, destroys the lives of other nations. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine is paying the most terrible price for freedom and for the ideals we share with you. Thousands of people died. Dozens of cities and villages were destroyed, now they are black ruins that look through burned windows at Russia and whether the world is able to stop it and bring it to account for everything done against peaceful people. Millions of Ukrainians were forced to leave their native places fleeing hostilities. And we can’t stand seeing how someone under the flag of the occupiers humiliates our people in some European cities sometimes. We can&#x27;t stand seeing how thousands of those responsible for this war smile cynically, hoping that Russia will succeed in breaking Europe and returning to, as they call it, business as usual. And hundreds of millions of people throughout the free world can’t stand seeing it either. Hence, we need to act now so that our shared freedom is protected for generations to come. The stability and free development of Eastern Europe, the Balkans and all other parts of our continent of values, our continent of freedom must be protected and guaranteed. And that means very specific things. Sufficient defense support for Ukraine, support with weapons, shells, so that this war does not drag on, so that victory is achieved as soon as possible. Sufficient sanction pressure on Russia - to destroy the illusion of the Russian leadership that they will be able withstand the struggle against the free world. Sufficient protection of Europe itself - our people, our markets from Russia&#x27;s hybrid aggression, which is betting on the spread of crises and poverty as much as it is betting on weapons. This also means our close coordination in strengthening our association, in the integration processes in Europe, in security cooperation between our states. A stronger Ukraine means a stronger Europe. A stronger Balkans means a stronger Europe. We must continue to help each other on the European path, as we are doing now. And it is imperative that the entire European Union, all European countries and the entire free world encourage Russian citizens to fight for a change in Russian state policy, encourage them not to remain silent and not to be complicit in terror. You know what to do. I am grateful to everyone who is already helping Ukraine. By helping us, you gave not excess, but what really matters to you. We appreciate it. We know that when we are fighting, when all of us are fighting together against this aggression, we are not just fighting for ourselves, but for Europe to win. The real struggle of each country for independence is a difficult path, it is what generations gain. And now we have the opportunity to achieve victory for ourselves, for our children, for our grandchildren, for all generations of our nations who fought for freedom earlier. I am sure we will win. We will win together. And this will be done in the name of Europe, in the name of all those who gave their lives for freedom. I thank you for your support! I thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The occupiers should know: we will oust them to our border, the line of which has not changed - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-29</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today we honored the memory of our warriors who gave their lives for our state, for our independence. This day of remembrance is set for the end of summer, August 29, to remind everyone about the tragic events of 2014, about Ilovaisk, about the fact that this war, which began with Russia&#x27;s occupation of our Crimea, with an attempt to seize Donbas, must end precisely there - in the liberated Crimea, in the liberated cities of Donbas, with our troops reaching the state border of Ukraine. We have always kept this goal in mind. We do not forget about it. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, our defense forces are doing their job. I am sure that you all understand what is happening, what we are fighting for and what we are striving for. And our warriors do not need any announcements or information waves in the back. Ukraine is returning its own. And it will return the Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Crimea, definitely our entire water area of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov - from Zmiinyi Island to the Kerch Strait. This will happen. This is ours. And just as our society understands it, I want the occupiers to understand it, too. There will be no place for them on Ukrainian land. Anyone want to know what our plans are? You won&#x27;t hear specifics from any truly responsible person. Because this is war. And this is what it is during the war. But the occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed. The invaders know it well. If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee. Go home. If you are afraid to return to your home in Russia - well, let such occupiers surrender, and we will guarantee them compliance with all norms of the Geneva Conventions. If they do not listen to me, they will deal with our defenders, who will not stop until they liberate everything that belongs to Ukraine. And it is not something special. It&#x27;s not something that supposedly started. We&#x27;ve been talking about it for 187 days. Today, I held meetings with the military, with representatives of the military-industrial sector, and with government officials. Important meetings, important topics, it is wrong to reveal them. But everyone can see the result over time. When our defenders destroy the logistics, bases, and headquarters of the enemy. We will continue this. I’ve made three appeals to foreign partners today. The first is Norway. I took part in the work of the energy forum, and I would like to thank the Prime Minister of Norway, Mr. Støre, for the new support package for Ukraine - about 200 million dollars as part of the energy preparation for winter. The second is France. A powerful association of entrepreneurs - hundreds of thousands of businessmen, millions of owners, managers and employees. I am grateful to them for their support and understanding of what we are fighting for in Ukraine, understanding that this struggle is shared by all Europeans. The third appeal is to the participants of the security forum in Slovenia, in particular, to our friends - the leaders of the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans. In the evening, I signed a decree awarding our warriors. 141 combatants were awarded state awards, ten of them posthumously. It is very important - today I had the honor to present the Gold Star Orders to the relatives, families of Heroes perished while performing combat missions. Eternal memory to all our heroes! Eternal glory to all those who fight for freedom for our entire land! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine will be a full member of the EU and is already closer to Europe than ever - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-30</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today, the Verkhovna Rada worked quite effectively and, in particular, endorsed several important laws and ratifications that bring us closer to the European Union. No matter how difficult it is - even in the conditions of such a war - we are moving step by step towards full membership in the EU. I have just signed these documents - on accession to the Convention on the Simplification of Formalities in Trade in Goods and to the Convention on the Common Transit Procedure. They are the actual implementation of the customs visa-free regime. We did it in record time and in a completely coordinated manner - all branches of government. And I want to thank all our diplomats, government officials, deputies who ensured this result. Ukraine will be a full member of the EU - and we are already closer to Europe than at any time in previous decades. Representatives of the IAEA have already arrived in our country and are to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It&#x27;s an important mission, and we&#x27;re doing everything we can for it to be safe and work at full capacity. Unfortunately, Russia does not stop provocations precisely in those directions from which the mission is supposed to arrive at the station. But I hope that the IAEA mission will be able to start its work. The situation at the ZNPP and in Enerhodar, in the surrounding areas, remains extremely threatening. The occupiers do not leave the plant, continue shelling and do not take away their weapons and ammunition from the territory of the NPP. They intimidate our plant’s staff. The risk of a radiation disaster due to Russian actions does not decrease for a single hour. Tonight I spoke about it with President of France Emmanuel Macron. We coordinated our positions in protecting Ukraine and Europe from Russian radiation blackmail. In the afternoon, I discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the dispatch of the mission to the plant with IAEA Director General Grossi. I hope that together with international organizations, with all our partners, we will be able to return the plant under the full control of Ukraine and force Russia to withdraw all its military personnel and weapons from the plant. Immediate and complete demilitarization of the ZNPP is needed. Only Ukraine can guarantee that all processes at the Zaporizhzhia plant will take place in accordance with standards and under control. Russia simply does not need it. Today I also held a meeting with American senators - Mr. Portman and Ms. Klobuchar, who arrived in Kyiv. These are people who have done a lot to protect our state and generally freedom in Europe and the world. I thanked them for the bipartisan support. The key topic of the negotiations is, of course, our interaction with the United States of America and the necessary steps for our joint victory in this battle for freedom. In particular, we discussed the strengthening of support for Ukraine - financial and security, strengthening of sanctions against Russia - these sanctions should grow like a snowball in order to demolish the terrorist potential of this state. Over this day, the occupiers brutally shelled Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and our other cities. And almost everywhere - civil infrastructure exactly. Only one Russian shelling of Kharkiv took the lives of 5 people today, another 12 were wounded. There are also victims as a result of other shelling occasions... Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken away by the occupiers! The Armed Forces of our country, our special services, our intelligence are doing everything possible and impossible for every Russian military to necessarily feel the Ukrainian response to this horrible terror that Russia has brought to our land. Throughout the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, from Crimea to the Kharkiv region, the Russian army does not have and will not have a single safe base, a single quiet place. Our defenders will destroy all warehouses, headquarters of the occupiers, their equipment, wherever they are located. Near Sevastopol - then near Sevastopol. Near Luhansk - then near Luhansk. This is Ukrainian land, and the occupiers can do only two things - flee or surrender. We leave them no other options. Currently, active hostilities are taking place almost along the entire frontline - in the south, in the Kharkiv region and in Donbas. Today I especially want to thank the warriors of the 56th and 110th brigades, who are showing maximum resilience and heroism in the Avdiivka direction. The warriors of the 53rd and 93rd brigades, who are defending the Bakhmut direction, defending courageously, intelligently, heroically. The Russian military command was instructed to capture the Donetsk region by the end of August. The end of August is already tomorrow. And in Donbas there are the Ukrainian flag and the Ukrainian heroes. Despite everything - despite the round-the-clock Russian fire, despite the occupiers&#x27; efforts to send various mercenaries and convicts there... I thank each and every one who stands firm, who defends positions and who accurately &quot;subtracts&quot; the invaders, their equipment, logistics and ammunition. Also, today I want to once again draw the attention of all our people in Crimea - please stay away from Russian military facilities, do not stay near Russian bases and military airfields, inform the special services of Ukraine of all the information you know about the occupiers, so that the liberation of Crimea can happen faster. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal glory to all those who help in the fight for life, for independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The decisive battle for freedom is taking place in Ukraine now; we are grateful to you that we are not alone in this battle - President&#x27;s address to the participants of the 26th annual Forum 2000 Conference in Prague</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-31</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister Fiala! Dear participants of the Forum! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today. Today is already the 189th day of the full-scale war of the Ukrainian people for freedom. And this is a war for freedom not only for our people. At different times and in different parts of the world, just such battles in which freedom either wins or loses take place. Not for one nation - for many. For many countries and for a long period of time. We all remember 1968. We remember how people then felt the desire for freedom, how they fought for freedom, and how a historic chance for freedom arose in the center of Europe for a huge space that was under the rule of tyranny at that time. That chance was destroyed by Soviet tanks in Prague. The world then did not feel the scale of this battle and what exactly was being destroyed. It did not feel what the result of victory would be, and did not want to see immediately what the defeat of freedom in this battle would lead to. Europe is still forced to overcome the consequences of the fact that tyranny managed to hold on for another 20 years at that time. Managed to hold on due to the fact that freedom did not get help. Did not get help to express itself to the fullest. Was not armed as it should have been. And due to the fact that people did not unite for its sake. What did it lead to? To death and suffering. To the wave of refugees. To the point that the countries of eastern and central Europe remained without freedom for more decades. And not only without political, cultural or personal freedom of people. But also without economic freedom, without many manifestations of normal social development. Only children and grandchildren were able to get the opportunities and well-being that should have been rightfully enjoyed by the generation of their parents who were young during the Prague Spring. But the most terrible thing is that the supporters of tyranny who lived at that time and who saw the destruction of freedom by tanks, all those who are annoyed by freedom, all those who despise the right of peoples to self-determination, just then got the illusion that freedom would lose to tanks. The illusion that it is just necessary to be cruel enough, to send a sufficient number of tanks, to intimidate the democratic world - and freedom will not endure and will inevitably fall. You hear exactly this illusion when the opponents of freedom say that it is necessary to more decisively suppress with tanks this or that protest, this or that uprising. When they say that it is just necessary to send more tanks to suppress the independence of this or that nation. This illusion caused a lot of evil after 1968. And this illusion is at the heart of Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24. But right here, on our land, and right now, in our time, we have a historic chance to destroy this illusion! In Ukraine, there is now a decisive battle for freedom. I am grateful to you that we are not alone in this battle. I am grateful for the support we have received. Grateful for the unity we maintain. I want to note the role of the Czech Republic in the protection of freedom - it is really significant. The personal involvement of Prime Minister Fiala and many representatives of your state is really important for us. We have already done a lot. Tyranny has felt that free nations know how to defend themselves, and that the victory of freedom is absolutely probable. This was achieved in different vectors of confrontation. From the frontline, where our Ukrainian warriors physically defend freedom, to the political sphere, in which we managed to achieve a historic result for the sake of Europe. Even in such a terrible time, Ukraine did everything necessary to obtain the status of a candidate for membership of the European Union. I am grateful to the people of the Czech Republic, your government and parliament for supporting us on the European path. However, the battle for freedom still continues! The length of the frontline on Ukrainian soil is 2.5 thousand kilometers. Active hostilities - with the use of all possible types of weapons, except, fortunately, weapons of mass destruction - continue on a line of 1.3 thousand kilometers. Imagine this scale! It is like the road from Kyiv to Prague. Russia is throwing everything it has to the frontline. And it has a lot of weapons and ammunition left from the time of the Soviet Union. And the occupiers are not restrained by the norms of any conventions or even elementary humanity. They are brutally shelling our cities with artillery. Every day and every night, people die from these terrible shelling occasions, from missile and air strikes. The mass terror against the people in the occupied territory has reached a level that Europe had only seen during World War II from the Nazis. Russia is blackmailing Ukraine, Europe and the world with a radiation disaster at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Think about it! No enemy of humanity has ever resorted to such blackmail - turned a nuclear power plant into a battlefield. Therefore, we all need to do a lot more together to win this battle for life. Ukraine needs constant and sufficient support with weapons and ammunition. So that we can not only hold the frontline, but also expel tyranny from our land, finally destroy its plans to subjugate Ukraine and anyone else in Europe. We also need financial support, and all leaders of the free world, heads of European structures are aware about this need. Winning a war requires financial stability. The world has already armed freedom in this battle against tyranny with powerful sanctions against Russia. But the potential of the terrorist state has not yet been destroyed by these sanctions. Russia still hopes that it will adapt to the sanctions and be able to withstand the pressure of the free world. Therefore, new sanctions packages are needed. From everyone - without exception. Rosatom and the entire nuclear industry of Russia must face blocking sanctions for radiation blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Russian nuclear scientists are working to repeat the Chornobyl disaster - this must be punished. Before it&#x27;s not too late. Thanks to sanctions, all potential aggressor states in the world should see that the price of radiation blackmail will be unbearable for the blackmailer. It is necessary to finally completely block the Russian banking system. How much can we talk about it? It is absurd that Russian banks can still work with the world financial system, as the Russian state is doing everything to cause the world as much damage as possible! We have already mitigated the acuteness of the food crisis provoked by Russia. Likewise, we must do everything to alleviate the energy crisis, due to which Russia is trying to destroy our unity and ability to defend ourselves. Russia is doing everything to ensure that the price crisis hits the democracies, hits powerfully, so that chaos spreads in Europe and the world. Hence, we must do everything we can to remove any energy dependence on Russia, to eliminate its ability to make money from energy sources and to help people survive this crisis. For our part, we offer our electricity to the EU countries - it is much cheaper than on the European market. Ukraine joined the unified energy system of the continent. We can export many times more electricity than now. Due to this, Ukraine can help at least its neighbors in the European Union overcome the price crisis, and this will definitely reduce the severity of the price crisis in the whole of Europe. We must think together how to get through this winter, given the situation on the gas market. No country in Europe - neither Ukraine, nor the Czech Republic, nor anyone else - should be left alone with the gas problem, as this is Russia&#x27;s goal. To ensure that we do not help each other. And finally, there must be a value-based response to everything that tyranny has brought to Europe now. To all this terror. Of course, I hope for your support in the creation and functioning of the Special Tribunal to punish those who started the war against Ukraine for the crime of aggression. Of course, we must do everything possible together to punish everyone who killed, tortured, deported Ukrainians. And, by the way, all this will become a historical punishment, in particular, for the system that sent tanks to you in 1968. Another imperative step we must take now. A value-based step. An ethical one. Russian propagandists can still work in European countries. Russian television, which is probably the biggest disinformation source in the world, is still available in European countries. And who are they working against, tell me? What exactly are they trying to destroy or at least discredit in the first place? European democracy! And Europe needs full protection from Russian propaganda. No Russian propagandist should remain on the territory of the EU. No Russian state television channel should operate on the territory of the EU. And the territory of the EU should be closed to those citizens of Russia who use Europe to rest from the evil they condone at home with their silence. Visa restrictions will encourage Russian citizens to feel that freedom must be fought for. Closing the European visa space for tourists from Russia will definitely protect all countries from the killers who were in Salisbury or Vrbětice. Ladies and Gentlemen! I have no doubt that we will win the battle for freedom. I have no doubt that we are capable of protecting Europe from any crises that Russia creates. And I have no doubt that we will rebuild everything that was destroyed by the war. But for all this to happen, we must have no doubt that we will preserve our unity - the unity of all Europeans, the unity of the free world. I believe that the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union will protect and strengthen our unity. Everyone who stands for freedom should stand together! Together until victory! Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>On behalf of intelligence, I express gratitude to all our people in the south of Ukraine and Crimea for the information provided - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-31</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today was a really busy day. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. All relevant leaders were there: Zaluzhny, Monastyrskyi, Budanov, Maliuk, Danilov and others. I think it is obvious what issues we considered. The military reported on the situation on the frontline, on the development of the situation. I will not reveal the details now. I will say only one thing: on behalf of our intelligence, I want to thank all our people who support us very strongly in the south of our country, and especially in Crimea. The intelligence officers are grateful for the information provided and will use it to the maximum. Let the enemies not forget whose peninsula they are staying on. Temporarily staying. The fighting in Donbas remains fierce – the hot spots in the region have not changed. Our guys are holding their ground. I am grateful to every warrior for resilience! Today I held a meeting with representatives of the Parliament and the Government of Ukraine regarding the current plans of the state’s work. I took part in the work of a very respectable forum in the Czech Republic, in Prague, called Forum 2000. It was founded by Václav Havel and is attracting significant attention in Europe. I addressed the participants of the forum and urged them to strengthen the support of our state in this war and the protection of all of Europe from Russian pressure. In particular, the issue of limiting European visas for citizens of Russia should be finally resolved. I think it is humiliating for Europe when it is considered as just one big boutique or restaurant. Europe is primarily a territory of values, not primitive consumption. And when the citizens of the state that wants to destroy European values use Europe for their entertainment or shopping, for the vacation of their mistresses while they themselves work for the war or to simply silently wait out the immoral fall of Russia, which is happening right now, this is completely contrary to everything which Europe was united for in general. The European Union was intended to maintain peace on the continent. Work for peaceful and democratic development of European countries. Europe cannot become morally deaf. And none of the European leaders will be able to justify the fact that the money allegedly doesn’t smell for them with the consequences of COVID. Because if there is such deafness, if there is such a loss of the ability to distinguish the smell of blood on bills, there will be no Europe, there will be no peaceful Europe. I am grateful to those Europeans who understand that in wartime it is the duty of any normal person to fight for the aggressor to lose, for the occupation to end, for the Russian military to leave Ukrainian land. Today I want to thank all our agricultural workers, port workers, diplomats and government officials who returned the status of a real guarantor of food security in African countries to Ukraine. 23 thousand tons of Ukrainian wheat under the UN World Food Programme have already arrived at the port of Djibouti. And they will be delivered to the people of Ethiopia, where there is the worst drought in the last 40 years and millions of people are on the verge of starvation. We are also restoring the relevant connections with the countries of the Arabian Peninsula - almost 40 thousand tons of wheat are headed to Yemen. And in general, more than 1.5 million tons of our food have already been exported by sea from the three ports that became operational thanks to the grain export initiative. We are doing everything for the world to feel the importance of Ukraine and be grateful to our people. I signed the decree on awarding our warriors today. 149 combatants were awarded state awards, 15 of them posthumously. We will always remember our heroes! Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia wants the world to make three mistakes: to get used to the war, to put up with the war and to forget about the war; this intention should never succeed - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Venice Film Festival</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-08-31</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants and guests of the Venice Film Festival! I appreciate the opportunity to address you today and tell our story. Tell about Ukraine, its people and the war that Russia has been waging against us for 189 days. A story that is beyond competition and beyond the limits of humanity and common sense. A drama based on real events. Embodied in life by real savages, murderers, torturers, terrorists. A tragedy accompanied not by Morricone&#x27;s brilliant music, but by gruesome ditties and sounds of explosions, gunshots and air raid sirens. Horror, not 120 minutes but 189 days long. 189 days of war, which continues in Ukraine and which Europe and the world are allegedly tired of. This is what Russia claims. This is what Russia wants. A primitive plot in three acts for the world to make three dramatic mistakes. To get used to the war. To put up with the war. To forget about the war. This intention should never succeed. Cultural figures, directors, producers, actors, screenwriters, DOPs, composers, artists, designers, film critics and thousands of other people - from different countries of the world and one cinematographic family. Your position is important, your voice is influential, your word is loud. The least you can do today, or rather, NOT do, is not to be silent, not to be afraid, not to turn away, not to pass by and not to be indifferent to the war in Ukraine, which was unleashed by Russia. Ladies and Gentlemen! For someone, power is only missiles and nuclear warheads. For us, power is in philosophy, mentality, these are meanings and words. For us it is also a weapon. I want every country, every nation, every institution and community in the world to have a clear idea of what Ukraine is going through now. To hear about this war in the most understandable language. For you, this is the language of cinematography. But you won&#x27;t see any scary footage now: explosions, gunshots, destruction, smoke, pain and tears. You will see things that most people don&#x27;t usually see. An integral part of every film, which not everyone pays attention to. Important names that fade into oblivion and obscurity, because the moment they appear on the screen, most viewers do two things: stand up and leave. I know that the first thing today is important. The second is impossible. To be continued… To be continued? The answer to this question today depends on all of us. Whenever someone talks about being tired of Ukraine, these titles should be mentioned. To get tired of Ukraine means to brush off these names. To forget these names. I am confident that the whole civilized world will never do this, will never give up, will stand with Ukraine to the end, to the victorious end, when truth and justice will hear applause! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>&quot;Knowing&quot; and &quot;defending&quot; always go hand in hand – President of Ukraine congratulates preschoolers, schoolchildren and students on the start of the new academic year</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-01</span></div>
  <p>Dear children! Dear schoolchildren, students! Dear children of Ukraine who are going to school for the first time today! Dear schoolchildren returning to school! Dear students who acquire professional skills! Dear friends! Today, September 1st is your Day, an important day for all of us, the Day of Knowledge. This year&#x27;s September 1st is very different from the thirty previous ones. But it still combines dozens of previous ones. Previous years, previous centuries. Battles that have been and battles that are going on. The victories that slipped away from our people, and the victories that the Ukrainians won, and the victory that will surely come. Today is the Day of Knowledge – the 190th day of knowledge. Knowledge that summarizes more than a thousand years of Ukrainian history, Ukrainian culture, Ukrainian life. Life – against all odds. Despite any threats. Despite enemy&#x27;s aspirations that have always lost and will lose to our desire to live. Your desire. The desire to love and be friends, to develop and grow, to defend what was received from parents and learn new things. That is, to learn and get stronger. That&#x27;s what makes this school year so special. It starts differently for everyone. Someone is far from home – in other regions of Ukraine. Someone is far from home – in other countries. Someone remotely – online. Someone is at their home school or at their university, but still – not at peace. However, it is important that the school year begins. It is important that learning continues. And that knowledge about Ukraine is not interrupted. Because this knowledge gives us strength. This knowledge has become our weapon. &quot;Knowing&quot; and &quot;defending&quot; always go hand in hand. To know more than a thousand years of history of our statehood and to defend when someone says that Ukraine did not exist. To know our geography – our beautiful land, our wonderful sea – and to defend not just the territory, but the incredible places where our identity was created at different times. To know our culture, to hear the Ukrainian word, because the answer is in our culture, in our literature, in our poetry. The answer of Shevchenko and Franko, Lesya Ukrainka and Stus, Symonenko and Honchar, Lina Kostenko and many others... The answer is why we will win. The crystal-white night was pierced by the sound of rockets. The sky is all in a bloody wreath, in a wreath of fires. How did the Ukrainians respond to this? On February 24, we united. Everyone united. We stood up for defending the dearest thing that we have. And you showed yourself – our children. We&#x27;re warriors, not lazy, not lying down. And our cause is true and holy. Don&#x27;t care what others are fighting for, We&#x27;re fighting for independence. That&#x27;s why our lives are so hard. Our children supported us, supported the state. They grew up very quickly. They did not get scared. And they helped. They helped – in bomb shelters. They took care of parents who were injured. They brought water and food – to the military. They raised money – to give to volunteers for the army. One can only be proud of Ukrainian children. Be patient, be patient – patience you grind, Steel your spirit - and be patient therefore, endure. No one will save you from troubles. No one will knock you off your own track. Stand on it. To death. Firmly. As long as light and sun, stand and wait. Pave your way – the one that you identified yourself, The one who chose you forever and ever. You have committed yourself to it since childhood, The Lord himself doomed you to it. This summer - no one had a summer. Time passed, as if from winter to winter. Instead of playgrounds, it was possible to be in basements. Instead of playing football in the street, children had to stay with adults and hear too much tragic news. But you were brave. And you made your choice – a choice in favor of Ukraine. Entire Ukraine – from Uzhgorod to Yalta, from Chornomorsk to Kharkiv. For the benefit of all our people. My Nation exists, and my Nation will always continue to exist! Nobody will scratch out my nation! All renegades and strays will disappear. And so will the hordes of conquerors-invaders! And it was a lesson for them, When the whole world could see, As if in millstones, our strong hands Ground the barbarian horde. We all know that victory will come. You all know that there will be victory. They stole part of your childhood, part of your youth... But you are free. You always will be. So be worthy of your will – and of our Ukraine. And everyone holds heavy iron hammer, And loud voice from top like thunder booms: &quot;Thou split this rock! Don&#x27;t let no cold, nor heat To stop you! Endure the drudgery, and thirst, and hunger, Because you are to break this rock apart!&quot; And on the reborn earth There will be no enemy, no tyrant There will be a son, and there will be a mother, And there will be people on the earth. Today you go to school, begin your studies, continue getting an education. Today you are going to the opportunity to see, hear, know – Ukraine. Knowledge about it, words about it, dreams about it - which were all about you. About your life. Free, clean, brave and smart. Today, I cannot but congratulate our people for having such children in Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will do everything so that Ukrainians, Poles and all the peoples of Europe live freely – President of Ukraine addresses the people of Poland on the 83rd anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-01</span></div>
  <p>Dear friends! Dear Polish people, brothers and sisters! Already 83 years separate us from that morning that put Europe and the world on the brink of ruin. On September 1, 1939, around 4 a.m., the Polish city of Wieluń was the target of a terrible bombardment. Nazi Germany went to war against all free nations, starting with Poland. And there will not be such a generation of Ukrainians, Poles, all Europeans or people in general who will forget what Nazism brought and what the Nazi executioners were held accountable for. People believed that it would be possible to avoid the repetition of those terrible crimes and such a cruel war. But it was such a morning again. Only on February 24, 2022, when bombs and missiles hit peaceful cities. Once again, the ideology of hatred is trying to seize space in Europe through mass murder and terror. Wieluń is repeated – in Kharkiv, in Mykolaiv, in the cities of Donbas, in Mariupol. Burnt cities and villages were repeated. Katyń was repeated – in Olenivka. The deportation was repeated. But there is something that did not happen again. No one made criminal pacts with hatred. And from the first minute of this war, we receive real help from true friends and brothers, who have become our powerful rear and are doing everything to help us win. We will do everything to ensure that Ukrainians, Poles and all the peoples of Europe live freely. So that every generation of our peoples, all Europeans and people in general remember what racism was and what the racist executioners will be punished for. We will do everything to ensure that the morning of September 1, the morning of June 22 and the morning of February 24 do not repeat. Never again. We will do everything so that hatred finally loses. Thank you for your support! Thank you, dear Andrzej, for your leadership! Glory to Poland! Glory to Ukraine! Eternal memory to all innocent victims!</p>

  <h2>It is demilitarization of the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP that is the goal of Ukrainian and international efforts - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-01</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today, a new academic year began in our country, as it should be. Despite everything. More than six months of full-scale war. Extraordinary destruction caused by the occupiers. But the education of Ukrainian children continues. It takes place in various formats, yet systematically and professionally everywhere. And I am grateful to all our educators who continue their work and guarantee with their attention to children that all young Ukrainians have an opportunity to become educated and live a decent modern life. More than 300,000 first-graders, almost 4 million pupils - this is the scale of September 1 this year. So, in addition to many other conclusions, a very important political conclusion can be made today - about the resilience of our state, about the strength of our society. Our educational institutions are effective. Our state and local communities ensure the restoration of education even in those areas where schools were destroyed during the occupation. Today I was in Irpin, Kyiv region. I saw the beginning of the work of such a restored school. 1,300 pupils will get their education there. The children went to the first grade, as is customary. I was happy to see them starting to study and to see the conditions it happens in. A good, comfortable, humanly warm school. And it will be the same on the entire territory of our state, which we will definitely oust the invaders from. No matter what they destroyed, we will restore everything, we will rebuild everything. No matter how much they want to destroy Ukraine and anything Ukrainian, our children will still go to their schools and universities and get an education absolutely freely. National education. Humanistic education. Education built not on lies and propaganda spread by the terrorist state, but on real knowledge, openness to the world and the best human values. Today, the IAEA mission arrived at Zaporizhzhia NPP. It&#x27;s good that it happened. The fact itself despite all the provocations by the Russian military and the cynical shelling of Enerhodar and the territory of the plant. Ukraine did everything to make this mission happen. But it is bad that the occupiers are trying to turn this IAEA mission - a really necessary one - into a fruitless tour of the plant. I believe that this will be prevented. It is good that the IAEA representatives have an opportunity to draw objective conclusions about the risks that have arisen at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for the first time in history. Moreover, the risks that have arisen precisely because of the occupiers. The main thing is to have the will to draw objective conclusions. Constant shelling, the presence of Russian military and weapons at the plant, tormenting Ukrainian personnel and attempts to put the plant under the control of Rosatom representatives who are not at all capable of a responsible attitude towards such an object... These are the reasons for the risks. We have clear evidence that Russia did a lot of cynical things to deceive the mission. In particular, with the help of intimidation of residents of Enerhodar. The occupiers forced people to lie to the IAEA representatives - to hand over some papers, sign something, say something. When we met with Mr. Grossi and members of the mission in Kyiv, we agreed that the mission would be accompanied by journalists from Ukrainian and international media. Independent journalists. For the world to see the truth. To see what is really happening. Unfortunately, this wasn’t done. Although it was promised. Unfortunately, the occupiers did not let the journalists in, but organized a bunch of their propagandists. Unfortunately, the IAEA representatives did not protect the representatives of independent media. We are hopeful that the mission will nevertheless draw objective conclusions from the circumstances at the plant. For more than three decades, 5 facilities have been under the control of our specialists - the Chornobyl plant and 4 operational nuclear power plants. The IAEA never had any claims regarding the activities of any of these facilities until Russia invaded our territory and brought its madness here. When the Russian military finally leave the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, when they take away their weapons, ammunition, when they stop shelling Enerhodar and neighboring areas and cease their provocations, the Zaporizhzhia plant will be able to return to a completely safe functioning, which has always been the case under the control of Ukraine. And the key thing that should happen is the demilitarization of the territory of the plant. This is exactly the goal of Ukrainian and international efforts. And it is bad that we have not yet heard the appropriate calls from the IAEA. Although we talked about it with Mr. Grossi at our meeting in Kyiv. This was the key - the key! - security point of our agreements. It was clearly stated: demilitarization and full control by Ukrainian nuclear specialists. Today I had a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark who arrived in Ukraine. I thanked him for the support, which is a very useful support, in particular in the field of defense. We discussed further steps to defend Ukraine and the entire united Europe, the sanction policy and the restoration of our state after hostilities. I held the first conversation with the new Prime Minister of Israel Lapid. I emphasized the necessity of Israel’s accession to the sanctions on Russia, sanctions for all the evil brought by this war. The evil that should have never returned again. I addressed the Polish people - September 1 is the anniversary of the beginning of World War II. I said an important thing in this address: just as that aggressor was defeated and convicted, this aggressor will inevitably be defeated and convicted as well. When the free world is united and the victim of aggression is not left alone, when no one signs disgraceful pacts with evil, the war ends with the victory of the forces of good. I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 155 combatants were awarded state awards, 22 of them posthumously. In total, since February 24, 28,042 Ukrainian warriors have received state awards. Those who heroically defend our state in all directions. Who ousted the enemy from the north, who are beating the occupiers in the east, who are destroying them in the south and, what is very important now, are working for the liberation of our Crimea. And today I especially want to express gratitude to our defenders in the Kharkiv direction - the 92nd brigade, all warriors and сommanding officer of the brigade Fedosenko. Thanks for your bravery guys! And also to our Air Forces. Yesterday, the anti-aircraft troops in the Donetsk region did a very good job - shot down another helicopter of the occupiers, already the 205th during the full-scale war, and two UAVs. In total, more than 800 Russian drones have already been destroyed. Today, our Air Forces did a good job against enemy missiles - thank you for the result! I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will force Russia to peace if all our partners keep their word as Ukraine does - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Ambrosetti Forum</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-02</span></div>
  <p>Dear participants of the Forum! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you right now as we are all going through a very risky time in this war. I would like to start with a fact that you may have missed. But I ask you to pay attention to it. Pay attention to the fact that the work of the Forum is currently being monitored by independent media. As far as I know, representatives of such media as Corriere della Sera, Rai, La Repubblica, La Stampa, New York Times, Financial Times, Reuters, Fox Business Channel, CNBC Europe are present at the Forum. And I think many others. In general, 280 media representatives cover the Forum. We are open to all. And we are open to them. And I can&#x27;t imagine that any of us are afraid of such or similar media. But I will tell you who is afraid of them. As you know, Ukraine is at the epicenter of Russian radiation blackmail right now. The Russian army seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant back in March and still holds it captive. This is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe - there are six nuclear reactors. The plant was repeatedly shelled. On the very first night, when the Russian occupiers entered there, on the night of March 4, they fired at the plant’s premises from tanks. There is video confirmation. Over the months after that, the situation has not changed - shelling and provocations every day, constantly. Under the cover of a nuclear plant, the Russian army is shelling neighboring cities and districts - this was the strategy. The occupiers are also shelling the plant itself - to put pressure on Ukraine and on all of you in Europe and on the world. The whole world. They want you to show weakness, to give up and stop supporting Ukraine. This is why Russia is doing this radiation blackmail. Recently, the Zaporizhzhia NPP was literally one step away from disaster - when the power transmission lines were damaged as a result of shelling, automation began to shut down the reactors. Only the Ukrainian nuclear engineers, who work there absolutely professionally even in such difficult conditions, manage to prevent the accident. If it was not for our professional people, Russia would have already provoked the worst disaster in the history of Europe - even worse than Chornobyl. And it is logical that this requires a strong international reaction. With the help of our partners, we ensured that the IAEA mission was sent to the plant - just yesterday the mission was there. We agreed with the head of the IAEA, Mr. Grossi, the members of the mission, when I met with them, that they would help with the key issue - the key issue of the safety of the nuclear power plant, the key issue is the demilitarization of the plant. Because this is key to protecting all of us, all Europeans, from a radiation disaster. We also agreed that together with the IAEA mission, independent journalists from Ukrainian and international media will arrive at the territory of Zaporizhzhia NPP. The same media that are currently covering this Forum. But what did we see? The Russian military stopped the journalists traveling with the mission at a checkpoint and did not let them go any further. Obviously, the occupiers felt that in the presence of a free media it would be impossible to lie to the IAEA and the whole world. Free media scares Russia. And this says everything at once - if you do not allow independent journalists to the plant, it means you are definitely aware of your responsibility for the catastrophe that the plant is on the verge of, and you are afraid that the world will draw conclusions about your responsibility. Unfortunately, the mission did not protect the journalists and did not put enough pressure on the Russians so that independent media would still be at the plant, so that everything would be open and fair there. And we talked about it with the mission and agreed. We said that without the admission of independent journalists, Russian propagandists would dominate the place. It would be a theater. Unfortunately, we also have not yet heard from the IAEA the key thing - the call to Russia regarding the demilitarization of the plant. And how can you do without it? I really hope that the mission will adhere to what the parties have agreed upon and what is in the interests of the entire international community. The greatest risk of a radiation disaster in 40 years must be removed. It is impossible to leave the military of the terrorist state at the nuclear power plant. There are situations when the fate of everyone on the continent depends on keeping one&#x27;s word. This is exactly the situation now. Ukraine has repeatedly demonstrated that we always keep our word. Always. This is evident in many areas. Of course, we did everything to ensure that the IAEA got access to the Zaporizhzhia NPP. I believe that this mission can still be fruitful. And also - this is another example - we have fulfilled our obligations for the grain export initiative, which alleviates the food crisis in the world. And therefore, it prevents a new migrant crisis. Famine in the countries of Africa and Asia would lead to new waves of migrants to Europe and, in particular, to the Mediterranean coast, to Italy. But we do everything for this not to happen. Ukrainian food has already reached 20 countries by sea. Our wheat was also sent to such countries as Ethiopia and Yemen, where the situation is particularly difficult. We will continue to keep our word on food safety guarantees. We are ready to help stop the price chaos in Europe. While Russia is making efforts to increase gas shortages on the market and prices, Ukraine is willing to increase electricity exports to EU countries. The return of the Zaporizhzhia plant to a safe mode of operation and its connection to the Ukrainian power grid is important particularly for this as well. The Russian presence at the plant significantly weakens our ability to help Europe in the energy sphere. At the expense of our electricity exports, we can stabilize the energy consumption of our neighbors in the EU, and as a result, this will reduce Russia&#x27;s energy pressure on the whole of Europe, and therefore on Italy. Even now, despite all the difficulties, we can export such a volume of electricity that corresponds to at least eight percent of the consumption of the whole of Italy. Moreover, Ukraine can become a green energy hub for Europe, which will replace Russia&#x27;s dirty energy resources. Dirty - in different senses of the word: both environmentally and morally. Our country has a huge natural potential for the development of capacities in green energy and in the production of green hydrogen. This is a potential of at least tens, and possibly hundreds of gigawatts of green electrical power and millions of tons of green hydrogen. It is important that there is already an infrastructure for transporting electricity and hydrogen to the EU. All this is there. And we have always kept our word on providing Europe with energy resources. Just compare it to the typical behavior of Russia, which always breaches treaties and uses the economy for political blackmail, not fulfilling its own promises. Even during a full-scale war, Ukraine did everything to gain the status of a candidate for EU membership. We quickly and efficiently fulfilled our obligations and we will do everything to start negotiations on EU membership. We will definitely be together with you in a united Europe. I am grateful to Italy and I am personally grateful to Prime Minister Mario Draghi for supporting our country on this European path and in protecting it from Russian aggression. Every word of our agreements with Mr. Draghi has been adhered to one hundred percent. A truly worthy person, truly worthy relations between our states. And life itself demonstrates that we need even more integration, even more agreements and results. We must ensure full compliance with every promise to increase pressure on Russia to finally stop the radiation blackmail, guarantee the complete safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and four other large nuclear facilities in Ukraine. All words regarding the support of Ukraine with weapons, shells and finances must be confirmed by actions as long as this war continues. Russia does not understand the words of peace. But it feels the strength on the battlefield very well. Strength should be with Ukraine, with the free world. Including the sanctions that the world applies as self-defense against Russian aggression. Strength should also be with business, primarily in Europe. The reputation of none of the companies will withstand radiation sickness. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately sever relations with the country that resorted to radiation blackmail. And don&#x27;t wait for disasters to make decisions, switch to predictable partners. Ukraine is just such a partner. Of course, now it is the war. Of course, Russian missiles hit our land. We lose people every day. And I will remind you of just one terrible number - 379. This is the number of Ukrainian children killed by Russian strikes. More than 735 children were wounded. All together in Europe and in the free world we have the power to end this war. And therefore, over time, we can move to much more meaningful economic relations. Ukraine is already one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of agricultural crops. You have already talked about this today. And together we can build one of the largest agro-processing clusters, strengthen our ability to be a guarantor of food security making Ukraine a place of production of affordable food for the whole world. Also, Ukraine is ideal for locating any processing enterprises. From woodworking to all types of mechanical engineering. We have a large amount of almost all resources and minerals - from gas to lithium, qualified people, fast logistics to the European market, good access to it. We want it, we strive for it. Ukraine is an ambitious reconstruction project after hostilities. Reconstruction worth hundreds of billions of euros - of everything that Russia destroyed with its terror. Tens of thousands of different objects have to be created virtually anew. And I am grateful to those Italian companies that have already shown their interest. And Ukraine is a completely new defense and security sector, whose power will match what we experienced in this war, and which will make a fundamental contribution to the security of Europe in the coming decades. Of course, after we force Russia to leave our land and make peace. And this will be possible if all our partners keep their word. Just as Ukraine does. Just as Italy does. I thank you for the firmness of the Italian word, for the actions that confirm that word. Thank you for supporting our state, for supporting our people who found refuge on your land. We will never forget it. I say this frankly, honestly, from the heart, from every citizen. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine&#x27;s movement to EU, transformation within the country is guarantee of freedom for all Ukrainians – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-02</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health! Today, I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief this week. The heads of the defense and security sectors were present, as usual: Zaluzhny, Monastyrsky, Budanov, Maliuk, Danilov and others. The commanders of operational areas – Syrsky, Litvinov, Kovalchuk – reported on the state of affairs. I think that you all understand what the main questions are. Certain decisions have also been made. I think we will all see them. We also considered today the issue of supporting our military, comprehensive support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I held a meeting devoted to the state&#x27;s further steps in European integration. This is another operational direction of our work – daily important work. For us, the movement of Ukraine to the European Union and the transformation within our country is one of the key elements of the long-term protection of the state, a guarantee of freedom for all Ukrainians. Therefore, the European integration process deserves not just separate attention to political, economic, social, and legal aspects, but a holistic approach. Moving towards Europe, we are strengthening Ukrainian national life as a whole. I am sure that Ukraine will become a full member of the EU. At least let&#x27;s do everything for it. I took part today in the work of an important forum in Italy. One of the most influential economic forums in Europe is the Ambrosetti Forum. I thanked Prime Minister Draghi, all Italians who help us and also protect the Ukrainian desire for freedom, for Europe. He proposed new directions of cooperation between our states – now and after our victory. It is important for Ukraine to maintain and strengthen Italian support despite any changes in political attitudes. By the way, this week it was the second address to Italian society – after the address to the participants and guests of the Venice Film Festival. We are fighting for support and understanding of Ukraine in all European countries, in all audiences of European societies. I remind you every time that the protection of Ukraine is the protection of all of Europe. Not only ours, but the entire democratic world. It is from this point of view that it is worth considering the decision agreed today by the G7 countries to cap the price of Russian oil. When this mechanism is implemented, it will become an important element of protecting civilized countries and energy markets from Russian hybrid aggression. Indeed, the price of Russian gas must also be capped. I am grateful to Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, who said this today. It is long overdue for such energy sanctions against Russia. The sanctions that will not only limit the flow of petrodollars and gas euros to Moscow, but also, importantly, restore justice for all Europeans, whom Russia is trying to blackmail with artificially inflated prices on the energy market. I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. 166 combatants were given state awards, 44 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our soldiers who beat the invaders everywhere in Ukraine, on our land! The Kharkiv area, Donetsk region, the entire Donbas, the south, Crimea – Ukraine is and will be everywhere. That&#x27;s it! There will be freedom. That&#x27;s it! And there will be Europe. We will never give ours to the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia prepares for energy attack on Europeans in winter; answer should be our unity and increased pressure – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-03</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today, our Air Force has a good result – downed Kaliber missiles, an attack helicopter of the occupiers, drones. I want to thank all our defenders of the sky from the East air command. Well done, today and always. Each such result is a saved life of our citizens, an opportunity not to be afraid for all our people. We will do everything so that Ukraine can fully defend its skies from Russian missiles and aviation. This is one of the fundamental issues for our country. And, of course, we are grateful to all our partners who help with the answer to this difficult question. Helping Ukraine with air defense is the most literal, most obvious way to protect people from Russian terror. Fierce fighting continues in many areas of the front – both in Kharkiv region, in Donbas, and in the south of our country. Russian troops again attacked Mykolaiv region, the districts of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk regions, and Kharkiv. Unfortunately, there are victims, and among them, unfortunately, are children. Ukrainian artillery is doing everything to destroy the striking potential of the occupiers, so that every Russian headquarters and all their ammunition depots, all logistical routes in the occupied territory are neutralized. I thank our soldiers who ensure this. Today, in particular, the fighters of the 55th artillery brigade in the Donetsk direction merit special mention – for their accurate fire on the enemy. I&#x27;m grateful to our intelligence and the Security Service of Ukraine for the accuracy of our answers regarding the positions and objects of the occupiers. Unfortunately, today we have an absolutely unacceptable event in the city of Chernihiv. In the afternoon, an explosion rang out at a public event in the city center, and a grenade launcher went off. Children are among the victims. The little boy is now in serious condition in intensive care. The law enforcement officers should find out as soon as possible why this happened, who brought combat weapons to this city event. All those responsible must be brought to justice. And they will be. And I call on the representatives of local authorities throughout the country, all our law enforcement officers to be very careful so that this never happens again anywhere. These days, Russia is trying to increase the energy pressure on Europe even more – gas pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline has completely stopped. Why do they do this? Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European – in all countries of our continent. It wants to weaken and intimidate the entire Europe, every state. Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons. It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles. And to protect against this, we all in Europe need even more unity, even more coordination, even more help to each other. This winter, Russia is preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans. And the key answers to this should be two things: first, our unity – unity in protection against the terrorist state, and second – Increasing our own pressure on Russia – this includes increasing sanctions at all levels, and limiting Russia&#x27;s oil and gas revenues. The more strikes we all make together, the fewer strikes these terrorists will be able to make. Thank you to everyone who defends our country! Thanks to everyone who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will return freedom to Crimea and make the peninsula one of the most comfortable places in Europe - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-04</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today is the anniversary of the detention of the first deputy chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, Nariman Celâl, by the occupiers in Crimea. He did not commit any crimes. The only thing he annoyed the occupiers with was the defense of his people and his country – Ukraine. Nariman Celâl took part in the work of the Crimea Platform last year. He arrived at the summit from Crimea and told the guests and participants what was really happening on the peninsula. Told about repression against all those who try to preserve their freedom and their culture. About the degradation of life in Crimea during the occupation. The Russian presence in our Crimea has turned it into one of the most dangerous and unfree places in Europe. And Mr. Celâl wanted to do everything to change this - to return normal life to Crimea, to return Ukraine. I believe that the Ukrainian flag and free life will return to Crimea again. We will liberate all our lands, all our people. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, special services are already taking the necessary steps for this. These steps can be heard. And everyone can see that the occupiers have already started fleeing Crimea. This is the right choice for all of them. We will return freedom to Crimea, to all our people in Crimea, we will return freedom to qırımlılar and we will definitely make Crimea one of the best, most comfortable places in Europe. Crimea deserves it. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. Although it is Sunday, there are no days off during the war. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, the commanders of operational areas and the head of intelligence delivered reports. Those were good reports. And today I want to thank the warriors of the 63rd battalion of the 103rd territorial defense brigade who ensured the result in the Donetsk region: the settlement was liberated. The 54th brigade in the Lysychansk-Siversk direction also took good steps, advanced and regained certain heights. I would also like to mention the 42nd separate motorized infantry battalion - thanks to its heroic actions, two settlements in the south of our country were liberated. I am grateful to all of you, guys! I spoke today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. It was, as usual, a very meaningful, very useful conversation about all the aspects of our relations. I expressed gratitude for the support already provided and for the efforts to limit Russian excess profits from oil and gas. I called for speeding up the provision of financial aid to us, to Ukraine. New sanction steps were discussed. In particular, I believe that the eighth package of sanctions should provide for pan-European visa decisions regarding Russian citizens so that none of those involved in this war can enjoy European hospitality. If the citizens of Russia support terror against Ukraine, against the whole of Europe, if they silently watch the genocide in Ukraine, they should not be able to use Europe for entertainment and fun. This is an important moral thing. Europe is a land of values, not Disneyland for supporters of terror. And visa restrictions will definitely demonstrate this. The free world must call the Russians to action - to action against those who started this war. By the way, it is the same as with the gas issue. Ukraine has repeatedly warned Europe that maintaining &quot;Nord Stream&quot; ties with Russia will be a problem that can turn into a disaster at any moment. That&#x27;s exactly what happened. Visa omnivorousness regarding citizens of the aggressor state, financial ties with Russia, energy dependence on Russia are all things that Moscow uses against Europe. And I am grateful to those European leaders who are aware of the level of the threat. A very important aspect of today&#x27;s conversation with Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen is the ability of the European Commission to carry out a rapid assessment as soon as we implement all its recommendations. We work every day for Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the EU! And every day we do everything to return our flag to our entire territory invaded by the occupiers. I am grateful to all our warriors who are holding and moving our positions forward! I am grateful to everyone who helps the defense of Ukraine! Together we will win! And finally. Today I received a report that two people who were directly involved in the tragic incident in Chernihiv were detained on suspicion of committing a criminal offense. The one who gave the order to bring combat weapons to a public city event. And the one who allowed the child to take the weapon in hands. Criminal proceedings are carried out by the State Bureau of Investigation. Once again, I warn all representatives of the authorities and law enforcement agencies on the ground: make sure that there are no combat weapons or other dangerous items at public events. People&#x27;s lives are the joint responsibility of everyone who must guarantee safety. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The shelling of the territory of the ZNPP means Russia does not care what the IAEA says and what the international community decides - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-05</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and a great friend of our people, Boris Johnson, is leaving his office. But I believe that he will not leave political activity and will continue to support the defense of freedom in Ukraine, in Britain and around the world. I spoke to him today. As always, it was a very good conversation. It is usually said that there is no friendship in politics, but Boris is the case when you understand each other with half a word, when friendship exists, when it is strong and when it really strengthens both our states. From the first minutes of Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against Ukraine and Europe, Boris was with us. His first and most important question was always: How else can I help? And I want to emphasize: even before February 24, we always felt that Britain stood with Ukraine. In a few years, we really managed to bring Ukrainian-British relations to the highest level throughout the entire time of our independence. This is an unprecedentedly high level. We have signed a very ambitious Political, Free Trade and Strategic Partnership Agreement. We have done a lot to strengthen the ties between our societies - economic, social, cultural. We have launched a program to renew the Ukrainian fleet. And now, during a full-scale war, we have agreed on the specific participation of Britain in the program of rebuilding Ukraine after hostilities. Today I thanked Boris on behalf of all Ukrainians, and I am sure that this is truly a multi-million Ukrainian &quot;thank you&quot;. I am already looking forward to continuing our cooperation with Boris in his new status. And I am no less looking forward to the start of cooperation with the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mrs. Liz Truss. We in Ukraine know her well - she has always been on the bright side of European politics. And I believe that together we will be able to do a lot more to protect our nations and to thwart all Russian destructive efforts. The main thing is to preserve our unity, and this will definitely be the case. Today I also spoke with President of France Emmanuel Macron, for more than an hour and a half. Very meaningful negotiations. First of all, about the situation at the front, about defense support for Ukraine. I am grateful to Mr. President and all the people of France for their unwavering striving for the protection of our common European values, our common united Europe. Separately and in great detail, we have focused on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We exchanged views on the results of the IAEA mission to the plant - by the way, the conclusions of the mission are to be presented tomorrow. I hope they will be objective. All the more so, today the last power transmission line connecting the plant to the energy system of Ukraine was damaged due to another Russian provocative shelling. Again - this is the second time - due to Russian provocation, the Zaporizhzhia plant is one step away from a radiation disaster. I consider the fact that Russia is doing this right now, right on the eve of the IAEA conclusions, very eloquent. Shelling the territory of the ZNPP means that the terrorist state does not care what the IAEA says, it does not care what the international community decides. Russia is interested only in keeping the situation the worst for the longest time possible. This can be corrected only by strengthening sanctions, only by officially recognizing Russia as a terrorist state - at all levels. Ukraine has a very clear, transparent and honest position: while we controlled the plant, there was no threat of a radiation disaster. As soon as Russia came, the worst scenario imaginable immediately became possible. This requires an international response - from the UN to every normal state. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to consistently, very thoroughly and accurately destroy warehouses, bases, crossings, headquarters of the occupiers. The Russian army entered the territory of Ukraine without expecting resistance. And it will run away from here having no other hope of salvation. And I want to once again thank all our defenders, our intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine who are doing everything to make it more and more difficult for the occupiers to stay in Ukraine every day. I also want to thank all our people in the temporarily occupied territories who help our army destroy the objects of the invaders. And today I especially want to thank the warriors of one of our rocket artillery brigades, who with their accurate fire destroyed the very Russian depot from which the occupiers took S-300 missiles to bomb Kharkiv. MLRS is a good thing. Thank you, our heroes! The occupiers will definitely get a response for today&#x27;s missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, for the constant shelling of Zelenodolsk, shelling of Nikopol, the Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the Kharkiv region, the cities of Donbas and our entire territory. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for the independence of our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is on Ukrainian land that the new center of economic growth in Europe will be - President&#x27;s speech at the meeting with the heads of big businesses in the framework of the opening of the New York Stock Exchange</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-06</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for your interest in Ukraine! Today is the 195th day of Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of our country. And today we are 195 times more confident in our independence than any time before this war. And it may sound paradoxical, but it is a fact. Ukraine does not for a single moment doubt itself, its future, its victory. Despite the fact that the enemy is still on our land, despite the fact that we still have a long way to go to liberate our entire territory. We have no doubt that it will happen. We already know the outcome of this war, and we are on our way to that outcome. I think you also feel this confidence of ours now, I believe that, at least, otherwise you would not waste your time on Ukraine. Today I want to talk to you about this feeling. About why any success story in Europe is now simply impossible without Ukraine - a story of both political and business success. They are possible only with Ukraine and in Ukraine. Let me provide some facts. First, the fact that we preserve and will preserve our independence is a fundamental factor of security for the entire region, for the entire east and center of Europe. The resilience of Europe depends on our resilience, and we have it. Just recall: when else was the European Union as united and capable of acting together as it is now, when else did we together with our partners - in particular with the United States of America, with President Biden - manage to unite Europe and the entire free world around the struggle for freedom, for our values, the values of freedom? We did an unprecedented thing. And this is not just a temporary thing, this is a fundamental factor. The struggle for our independence is a struggle for the right to stability, the right to security for all of us, for all of Europe. The second fact is that we are perfectly integrated with our region and will be fully integrated with the European Union. Ukraine has already obtained the status of a candidate for EU membership - this happened precisely during this war - and we will definitely obtain full membership. And not only geographically, economically or politically are we integrated with other European nations, but also in terms of values. It is very important. Ukrainians appreciate freedom, education and work. Appreciate in the same way as any developed society. Although our country is attributed to the group of developing countries, we already have all the foundations to become a developed country. It just takes time. Speaking purely about the economy, we already have very profitable logistics and trade relations with the EU market - and these are duty-free conditions. We also have special conditions for access to the markets of Great Britain, Canada and Japan. We have traditional and very strong ties with the United States market. Without our agricultural exports, it is impossible to imagine stability in the markets and in general in many countries, primarily in Asia and Africa, and this was proven by the Russian blockade of our ports - when our agricultural sector stopped, dozens of countries found themselves on the verge of starvation. Now we are re-establishing export links, including by virtue of new routes and partial restoration of traditional sea exports - millions of tons of Ukrainian food are already being exported again, again by sea. The third fact is that we have an almost complete range of natural resources and minerals. From gas to uranium, from lithium to titanium, from coal to quartzite and much more. And we have not only resources, but also a strong culture and tradition of extraction, processing and production. We have qualified people. We have a developed transport sector and convenient logistics - with access to the European Union market. By the way, one of the reasons why Russia started a war of aggression against Ukraine is their apprehension that we will become not just an industrial competitor for Russia, but a real substitute for it in many markets of many countries. The fourth fact is that Ukraine can and, I am sure, will definitely become a green energy hub for Europe. We are capable of replacing dirty Russian energy resources. Ukraine has a huge natural potential for establishing capacities in green energy and in the production of green hydrogen. This is a potential of at least tens, and realistically looking at things – hundreds of gigawatts of green electrical power. Look at the situation in the European energy market - this market desperately needs a player like Ukraine. Of course, we have already started exporting electricity to the EU. It is a very important factor that it happened during the war. We export, but the scale of cooperation can be hundreds of times larger - imagine the profit for each participant in the energy business. The fifth fact is that we have already started the implementation of the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after hostilities. At this stage, this is the Fast Recovery Plan, which allows us now to restore everything that is needed in the liberated territory urgently: social, educational infrastructure, heat supply, transport. But the general project of Ukrainian reconstruction will be the largest economic project in Europe of our time. The largest for several generations. Its volume is already estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. And with the necessary modernization of the Ukrainian infrastructure, taking into account security needs, it is more than a trillion dollars and in a fairly short term - less than ten years. No company will find such opportunities anywhere else in the world as in Ukraine. Your companies will not find anywhere else such opportunities as in Ukraine. Our government delegation headed by First Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Economy Yulia Svyrydenko is present in New York. Mrs. Svyrydenko and other members of the delegation will be able not only to answer your questions about opportunities in Ukraine, but also to present industries and projects for investment. Infrastructure funds will find a large number of projects in the airports and in the construction of new roads and bridges. Real estate funds will receive a market with hundreds of millions of square meters of new housing, offices, logistics, and industrial real estate. Banks and financial institutions can enter the huge lending market for all these projects in Ukraine. Insurance companies will be able to offer new insurance products, taking into account the specifics of our region and our risks. Hotel operators will be able to reveal our great tourist and business potential - the whole world is interested in seeing Ukraine, feeling it and being here. And I encourage you to plan your investment now. Without waiting for us to reach our victory. Pay attention - today about 80 percent of our territory is free from the enemy. Our warriors, our people are constantly increasing this figure. Moving towards victory every day. But victory is not only a military way, it is also an economic way. Our business makes its contribution. Our business is functioning. And most of Ukraine is already willing to implement new business projects. You all know very well that preparation for the implementation of any business project takes time. Time for team building, market analysis, site purchase, design, permitting procedures, etc. The preparation period is always a minimum budget, but a lot of time. Time that is spent while others could already start working. Therefore, start now - to be the first. We have hundreds of thousands of qualified young engineers and IT specialists, and this Ukrainian industry is world-renowned. We have an extremely favorable tax regime for IT. Taking into account all economic and logistical factors, we are a uniquely advantageous location for the offices of technology companies. Deploying production in Ukraine - from metal to pharmaceuticals, from mechanical engineering to agricultural products, you get advantages that you will not find in any other country next to the European Union market. Perhaps some of the companies whose representatives are here now or companies related to you are still working on the Russian market - and not just selling, but producing there. The prospect for all businesses is that they will have to leave Russia in any case. And therefore, it is profitable to come to Ukraine. It is on Ukrainian land that the new center of economic growth in Europe will be. You may ask me: how can you come to Ukraine now, as the war is still ongoing? I will answer you: any company that will have an opportunity to put the Made in Ukraine label on its product will automatically become a part of the story of Ukrainian bravery and victory, a globally known story, and at the same time - a part of our life, which we defend with all our strength - and with the help of the strongest world powers and leaders. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Europe is not a place for promenade for Russian murderers and those who support them – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-06</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! We’ve got important events today. The European Union has taken a significant step in the visa issue regarding the citizens of Russia. The European Commission has approved a proposal to suspend the simplified visa regime currently in force between the EU and Russia. Of course, this is not yet a complete visa ban. But this already demonstrates to the citizens of the terrorist state that they bear certain moral responsibility for their state&#x27;s aggression against Ukraine and the whole of Europe. There is such a situation now, when it is inadmissible to remain silent. And it is inadmissible not to oppose terror. It is absolutely unacceptable that European territory can be used for tourism or shopping by those who at home, in Russia, not only support the split and mockery of Europe, but also work for it. And it cannot be taken lightly that Russian propagandists can still stay in European countries, lie daily in reports and broadcasts from European capitals. Lie about Europe! Humiliate Europe! And at the same time be in Europe. An absurdity that must be stopped immediately. I am grateful to Mrs. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and to all European leaders who support visa restrictions for Russian citizens. And we must remember: in addition to the moral side of the issue, it is also a matter of elementary security. Russia has repeatedly sent killers to Europe under the guise of ordinary tourists. They have already admired enough the spire in Salisbury, German streets and warehouses with weapons in the Czech Republic. Enough. Europe is not a place for promenade for murderers and those who support them. The second important piece of news is the IAEA report. The mission, which visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, presented a documentary summary of its work. The report notes the presence of Russian military equipment on the territory of the NPP, emphasizes pressure on our nuclear specialists, and makes clear references to the Russian military occupation. That&#x27;s good. As for IAEA Director General Grossi&#x27;s proposal to create a protection zone at the plant, we need to look at the specific content of such an instrument: what exactly can be the protection? If the content of this proposal is to demilitarize the territory of the nuclear power plant - and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster - then we can support such a demilitarized protection zone. In any case, I believe that modern international organizations need a much broader mandate for their actions. I believe that the world not only deserves, but also needs the representatives of the IAEA to force Russia to demilitarize the territory of the NPP and return full control to Ukraine. If Russia puts the world on the brink of a radiation disaster, the world must have adequate means to put Russia in the conditions where the terrorist state will be forced to stop the terror. I took part in a number of important economic events in New York today - our government delegation led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko is there. Resistance to Russian terror and protection of our state take place at different levels. Defense goes hand in hand with diplomatic efforts, information work and, of course, the economy. Saving and creating new jobs in Ukraine, attracting investments and business projects, expanding logistics capabilities, protecting our needs for financial assistance - all this is absolutely necessary. And it is necessary now - when the war is still ongoing. One of the most famous stock exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, is one of the best places to attract the world&#x27;s economic attention to Ukraine. And today was a Ukrainian day at the stock exchange. And this Ukrainian day started a global campaign to promote our economic potential. We will do everything to ensure that the world&#x27;s leading businesses work with Ukraine and in Ukraine. It is obvious that the key challenge here is security. We are constantly improving our ability to respond to this challenge - to protect our state and our people. Today I want to thank the warriors who distinguished themselves in this. Five out of six Russian Kh-101 missiles were shot down only in the first half of the day. This is an expensive loss for Russia - and it saved many Ukrainian lives. Four of these missiles were shot down by servicemen of the Air Command South. Well done, guys! Also, special thanks today to the warriors of the 79th airborne assault brigade, who heroically repel the enemy in the Donetsk direction. By the way, today I want to address all our people who create an information picture - in one way or another. Please draw your attention and the attention of society to the fact that the fierce confrontation continues almost along the entire frontline. This is one thousand three hundred kilometers of active hostilities. And it is simply unfair, when there are a lot of talks about certain areas of the front, while others seem to be forgotten. Although our warriors in many directions are doing an absolutely great job, they are absolute heroes. In Donbas, in the Kharkiv region, in the Zaporizhzhia region, in the south, in the border regions of the north and east of the country. The defense of the whole state needs equally sincere and serious attention. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief - we are solving all issues related to the advance of our Armed Forces and the destruction of the occupiers as quickly and accurately as possible. 50,000 Russian lives have already been lost in this completely senseless war for Russia. And the occupiers do not care about even such a level of losses. And we do care about every life of our heroes, our defenders. We do everything to protect the lives of Ukrainians. And I am grateful to the partners who help us with this. Today, my diplomatic day began at 8 am - with a conversation with Mrs. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives. As always, productive and very warm. We coordinated our steps to protect Ukraine and freedom as such from Russian aggression. In the afternoon, I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte about increasing sanction pressure on Russia, about new defense and macro-financial assistance to our country. I am very grateful. I have just had a conversation with the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mrs. Liz Truss. It was her first conversation in her new status with a foreign leader - and it is a great honor for Ukraine. I congratulated Mrs. Prime Minister on the beginning of her work and I feel that we will be able to build a profound and productive relationship. Mrs. Prime Minister takes office at a time of great difficulties. Russian energy blackmail, constant efforts of the terrorist state to destabilize the political situation in Europe and the free world, constant Russian disinformation... However, by maintaining our unity and working in full coordination, we can overcome this, too. We have discussed how to further increase the pressure on Russia, so that the price of aggression for it would constantly increase. And so that the defense support for our state would also constantly increase. I’ve heard very important words about our cooperation, future security guarantees for Ukraine, and about the reconstruction of our state. It is very important that Great Britain retains a leadership role in consolidating the free world and protecting freedom. I invited the Prime Minister to visit our country. And I am thankful for the firm confidence that Ukraine and the free world will definitely win in this war started by Russia. I am grateful to everyone who protects Ukraine and freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This week we have good news from the Kharkiv region; I think every citizen feels proud of our warriors - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-07</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! From now on, every year on September 7, Ukraine will celebrate Military Intelligence Day - a professional holiday of people whose contribution to our defense and future victory cannot be overestimated. Previously, we did not have such a holiday specifically at the state level, although military intelligence officers usually received congratulations on this day. I signed a decree that brings this day to a proper level. In the morning, I congratulated our intelligence officers, thanked them for their service, thanked Kyrylo Budanov, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, for the results Ukraine needs. Presented state awards to the best intelligence officers. And I believe that I will repeatedly award representatives of the intelligence community of Ukraine for their achievements, for operations that continue constantly, and for successes that help our Armed Forces and the entire state move towards the liberation of our entire land. This week we have good news from the Kharkiv region. Probably, you all have already seen reports about the activity of Ukrainian defenders. And I think every citizen feels proud of our warriors. It is a well-deserved pride, a right feeling. Now is not the time to name the settlements to which the Ukrainian flag returns. But it&#x27;s time to say thank you to the 25th airborne brigade, the 92nd separate mechanized brigade and the 80th airborne assault brigade for their bravery and heroism shown during combat missions. I also express gratitude today to the 406th separate artillery brigade for the extremely successful hits in the areas where the occupiers are concentrated in the south of our country and to the 60th separate infantry brigade, which consistently advances our positions. Each success of our military in one direction or another changes the general situation along the entire frontline in favor of Ukraine. The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions of our defenders in Donbas will be, the more reliable the defense of Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region will be, the faster we will be able to liberate the Azov region and the entire south. I want to say one more thing today - it is very important and very sensitive. This applies to Ukrainians held captive by the occupiers. At the level of Ukrainian intelligence and other involved structures and people, we are constantly trying to achieve the liberation of our prisoners of war. This work never stopped. And the active actions of our defenders also mean the possibility of capturing a sufficient number of enemies to encourage the exchange and release of Ukrainian prisoners of war. I emphasize: we remember all our people held captive by the occupiers. An important decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine was made today. Sanctions have been applied to 606 individuals who belong to the ruling elite of Russia. 28 members of the Security Council of Russia, 154 members of the Federation Council of Russia, 424 deputies of the State Duma of Russia. They are all responsible for this war, for the terror against our people. And none of them will avoid responsibility - it&#x27;s only a matter of time. We have already taken some of the necessary legal, diplomatic and political steps for this responsibility for them. We also take all other steps deliberately. Today, an important operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine - regarding the activities of some persons subject to sanctions on the territory of our country. I have repeatedly emphasized: there will be no place for smugglers and criminal networks in Ukraine. It seems that some of them did not understand. Well, they will understand. The customs officials who helped the smugglers, including the leadership, have been removed from office and will receive a legal response for all their illegal actions. As for those persons subject to sanctions, who also have foreign citizenship, in particular Russian and Romanian, based on the proposal of the Security Service of Ukraine and in accordance with the norms of the current legislation, I made a decision to terminate the Ukrainian citizenship of these persons. I’ve held a meeting with the head of the government, the minister of finance, the relevant deputy head of the Office regarding the draft budget for the next year. It is clear that this will be the budget of a warring country. Government officials will present the parameters of the project, but I will now mention some important points - politically important points. First. More than a trillion hryvnias will be allocated to the security and defense sector next year. That will be priority number one. Second. Social obligations must be provided in full. In particular, I want Ukrainian pensioners to hear me: next year, as well as this year, the government is tasked with indexing pensions for all our pensioners. Third. To withstand this period and ensure financial and social stability, it is necessary to reduce as much as possible all non-critical expenses of the state, all that does not help defense, does not help the economic development of the country, social and cultural provision of our people. Accordingly, the government should present a program to reduce expenditures on the state enterprises, on the apparatus, on the institutions that do not meet the needs of this special time. I am waiting for proposals from government officials. Fourth. This is the intensification of economic relations. The lending program &quot;5-7-9%&quot; is maintained. There will also be other programs and solutions that should help businesses work, save jobs and attract new employees. And fifth. A special recovery fund will be established, which will be filled, in particular, at the expense of confiscated Russian assets. I expect that the draft budget will be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on time, as required by law. I spoke today with German Chancellor Scholz. Many topics: the responsibility of the terrorist state, the further strengthening of the defense capabilities of Ukraine, and the financial support for our state. I thanked Mr. Chancellor for confirming the €5 billion macro-financial aid from the European Union. This is an important decision. A decision that will enable us to support Ukrainians and provide social payments for our people. I also thank the European Commission and all our partners in the EU for this financial package. The provision of another three billion euros is being discussed, we are waiting for the format of the decision. The implementation of the grain export initiative, which is an important tool for our economy and for all partners of our state, continues. Ukrainian food was exported to three continents. To Africa, Asia and Europe. In detail, 54 vessels have already been sent to Asia, 16 vessels have already been sent to Africa, 32 vessels have already been sent to Europe, and part of this volume, by the way, is again sent to Asian and African countries afterwards. Today Russia voiced another blatantly false statement that the absolute majority of Ukrainian grain is allegedly exported to European countries. Well, words of truth have not been heard at the official level in Russia for a long time, and this does not surprise anyone. By the end of this month, at least 3 million tons of agricultural products can be exported from our seaports. And a significant part is for the poorest and most needy countries. In particular, the first cargo was delivered to Ethiopia. The route was not easy: first by sea, then by trucks. But hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians are actually saved from starvation. Perhaps Russia is not OK with this and does not want to notice it. However, this is exactly what the world needs. It is necessary to save countries on different continents from chaos, it is necessary to save people from starvation. Unlike Russia, we do not make a racist division of the world into those who deserve security and those who supposedly do not, into those who deserve to live without famine and those who supposedly do not. We support all people, all countries. Both those who help us and those who still refrain from helping us. Both those that are more stable and those that are less stable. I emphasize once again: Ukraine was, is and will be the guarantor of world food security. I am thankful to everyone who defends our country! I am thankful to each of our partners who help us fight for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In total, more than a thousand square kilometers of the territory of Ukraine have been liberated since the beginning of September - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-08</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! It is with deep sadness that I learned of the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. A great loss for all of Europe, for the world. On behalf of the people of Ukraine, I extend condolences to the Royal Family, the entire United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken paid a visit to Kyiv today. We held negotiations very useful for both our countries, as we are making a common cause, defending freedom. I thanked the Secretary of State for his personal role in helping us; President Biden – for the decisive and effective leadership; the US Congress – for the unwavering bipartisan and bicameral support, and every American – for their sincere understanding of our struggle. We have President Biden&#x27;s decision on a new $675 million defense aid package. It was also announced that Ukraine will receive more than a billion dollars from the general package of support for European democracies. Each of these steps of our partners has a real impact on the strength of our state and the whole of Europe in defense against Russian terror. As always, the range of topics at the negotiations with Mr. Secretary of State was wide. We discussed political cooperation, our interaction in the financial sphere - macroeconomic support is now as important as support with weapons and ammunition. Of course, attention was paid to the Fast Recovery Plan and, in general, to the reconstruction of Ukraine after the Russian strikes. I’ve raised the issue of officially designating Russia a terrorist state. The legal reality must always correspond to the actual reality. And it is a fact that Russia has become the biggest source of terrorism in the world. You can choose one or another format of procedures, one or another formula of legal pressure against Russia for terror, but the world must receive an unequivocal signal that Russian terror will not be forgiven. I continue to establish new ties for Ukraine - I had a conversation with the President-elect of Kenya, the first conversation in the history of relations between our states. I congratulated him on winning the elections, and we agreed to enhance cooperation. We also talked about overcoming the food crisis - we are doing everything for this. Just today, four ships with agricultural products for Asian countries left our ports. At these hours, more than 65 thousand tons of wheat enter the port of Sudan for unloading. Yesterday, a bulker with wheat departed for Kenya - more than 50 thousand tons. Vessels for Lebanon and Libya are now being loaded in Odesa. In the Pivdennyi Port, a ship bound for India is waiting to be loaded... That is, the geography of Ukrainian agricultural exports by sea is very broad. Literally every working day of the grain export initiative refutes Russian lies about it. Ukraine supplies agricultural products to consumers from different continents. And it is our supply that guarantees food security at the global level. I held a new meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. First of all, regarding our active actions on the frontline. Within the ongoing defense operations, our heroes have already liberated dozens of settlements. And today this movement continued, there are new results. In total, more than a thousand square kilometers of our territory have been liberated since September 1. I am grateful to everyone who made it happen! I am grateful to the army, intelligence officers, and special services for every Ukrainian flag that has been hoisted these days. We listened to the reports of the commanders of operational areas at the meeting today, there are certain decisions. The Staff will continue its work in the format of such fairly frequent meetings, so that our commanders on the ground have full support at all levels and so that the Armed Forces of our country, intelligence and the entire defense and security sector receive all the necessary resources, all the necessary material, political, information, diplomatic and any other means for the effective defense of Ukraine and the expulsion of the occupiers. All state activity is focused on the needs of the front and protection of our people. I am grateful to all Ukrainian warriors, to all those who fight for freedom for our people - both in the south and in the east, those participating in the battles at the front and those who contribute to our victory with respective operations in the rear of the enemy. The liberation of our land is the merit of everyone who clearly and timely fulfills the general defense plan. And I especially want to thank today the fighters of the 115th separate territorial defense brigade of the Operational Command &quot;North&quot;, who distinguished themselves with bravery and the necessary results for Ukraine in the battles in February-March, when they stopped the advance of the enemy, and who continue to defend our state in the north direction. I am also grateful to the fighters of the 117th separate territorial defense brigade operating in the direction of Sudzha - Sumy, and the 1st tank brigade, which is firmly holding its position in the direction of Gomel - Horodnya. We remember all the threats, we thank all our heroes. I want to once again call on those who inform the society, who comment on the military situation: please analyze the whole picture, express gratitude and support to all our defenders, do not forget about any of them. Eternal glory to all those who stood up for the defense of Ukraine! Eternal glory to our indomitable people! Ukraine is and will be free! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>As of now, the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberate and take control of more than 30 settlements in Kharkiv region – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-09</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! We have good news from the European Union. The provision of EUR 5 billion of macro-financial assistance to our state has been approved. It&#x27;s very important. And secondly, there is a decision of the Council of the EU to suspend the visa facilitation agreement signed by the EU and Russia. This decision will be effective from Monday. And there are specific recommendations of the European Commission regarding visa restrictions for citizens of Russia. This is the protection of Europe, it will make it difficult for those who do not want to change anything, do not want to fight against the war, but just want to consume and have fun, as if nothing is happening in Europe, as if there is no Russian terror. United Europe is the second target for Russia after our state, our independence. And it is right that Europe defends itself. Today in Kyiv, I discussed this topic with our friends – the President of Latvia and the Prime Minister of Poland, who arrived on a visit. Of course, the recommendations at the pan-European level are very important. However, there is legal scope to go further to do more. As the Baltic states and Poland did. A terrorist state can hardly be regarded as a source of tourism or any business visits. We also talked today about our bilateral cooperation with EU countries. In particular, this concerns the mitigation of procedures at our border. We must remove the barriers that still hinder our citizens and companies. Peoples who together defend European freedom should be as close as possible. It is known that there are certain difficulties and queues at the Ukrainian-Polish border. I discussed this with the Polish Prime Minister today – we agree on how to solve this problem. The Prime Minister of Ukraine and his Polish counterpart will agree on all technical details. So today, we discussed the issue of joint customs control, expansion of border crossing points, facilitation of postal exchange between Ukraine and the EU countries - I turned to Mr. Prime Minister of Poland with a proposal to lower the price of postal items. This is important for our people, for everyone who needs special support now. And one more important aspect: Poland asked us to help in the energy sector, in particular with the export of electricity. Of course, we will provide it. We will always help the Polish brothers who have been helping us since the first day. Two more plaques appeared on our Alley of Courage in Kyiv today – with the names of Mr. Levits, the President of the Republic of Latvia, and Mateusz Morawiecki, the head of the Polish government. We will gradually note all the leaders of politics, culture, sports and business, who personally visited Kyiv during the most difficult half-year from February 24 to August 24, and personally participated in the defense of our state. Today, I had the honor of presenting state awards to representatives of the media who were honored on the occasion of Independence Day this year. These are reporters, operators, producers, editors, and presenters... They all made a significant contribution to our victory in the media confrontation with Russia, to break through Russian propaganda and spread simply the truth about the war, about our independence. A moment of silence was observed for representatives of the media whose lives were taken by this war. As of today, they are 38 people – not only citizens of our country, but also foreigners who came to Ukraine for the truth and died from Russian weapons. Our army, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine continue active actions in several operational areas. They continue successfully. I want to once again appeal now to some bloggers, who are sometimes in a hurry to announce the results of certain active actions of our troops on the front lines... Please do not hurry with the reports, do not complicate the task for our army with your haste. Please do not report the specific details of the defense operation earlier than the official representatives of our state will say about it. At this time, the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated and took control of more than 30 settlements in Kharkiv region. In part of the villages of the region, actions to check and secure the territory continue, we are gradually taking control of new settlements - everywhere we are returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for all our people. I am asking Ukrainians from the liberated territory: please give the representatives of our forces any information known to you about the crimes of the occupiers on Ukrainian land. Units of the National Police are returning to the liberated settlements of Kharkiv region. And I want to thank today our intelligence, our secret services, who once again showed themselves very effectively in throwing the enemy out. Many thanks to the soldiers of the 14th separate mechanized brigade named after Prince Roman the Great – the commander in the Kharkiv direction especially noted the heroic actions of the guys from this brigade. We do not forget about other directions. Fierce battles continue both in Donbas and in the south of our country. I&#x27;m thankful to the Marines of the 503rd Battalion for their courage in Donetsk region. My thanks to the intelligence of the 131st Separate Reconnaissance Battalion who, risking their lives, are the first to come forward and ensure the performance of the assigned tasks by the combined military units in Kherson region. I&#x27;m thankful to all our boys and girls, men and women who are fighting for Ukraine! I signed new decrees on awarding our soldiers. 293 combatants were given state awards. And today in Kyiv I held a meeting with Haluk Bayraktar - a person whom Ukrainians do not need to introduce. The context of the meeting is clear, and the results will be clear. We are strengthening our state. I presented Mr. Bayraktar with the Order of Merit of first class – it was truly deserved. Glory to everyone who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Since early September, about 2,000 kilometers of Ukraine&#x27;s territory have already been liberated – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-10</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! First of all, today I want to congratulate two of our cities, beautiful, strong cities, on their day – Lyman and Dnipro. Lyman in Donetsk region is still waiting for our flag, and this is inevitable – Ukraine always returns. We demonstrate it well. The entire Donetsk region will be liberated, will be safe and happy again, as it should be in Ukraine, as it should be everywhere on our land. The Armed Forces of Ukraine and all those who defend our state, the Special Operations Forces, our intelligence, special services, the National Guard, the police will restore peace in every corner of our state, where Russia has brought only grief and suffering. There will be peace. Peace goes together with the Ukrainian flag, together with our defenders. Dear residents of Dnipro! Your city has done so much for Ukrainian defense both since 2014 and since February 24 that the history of our victory is also the history of Dnipro, it is undoubtedly well deserved. The health and lives of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers were saved in Dnipro. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians received shelter and help in Dnipro during the war years. The front has always felt and still feels the support of the people of Dnipro. I thank you all for this! And I wish you all, as well as all Ukrainians, one thing – the fastest possible victory. I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Headquarters today. Reports on the situation on the front lines from the commanders of operative areas were presented. The necessary decisions were made. We discussed support of our military. We listened to the report of Defense Minister Reznikov on the results of the meeting at Ramstein Air Base. Thanks to our partners for their support! The movement of our soldiers in different directions of the front continues. As of now, as part of active actions since the beginning of September, about 2,000 kilometers of our territory have already been liberated. These days, the Russian army is showing its best – showing its back. And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. There is and will be no place for the occupiers in Ukraine. However, I emphasize once again: if any of the Russian troops or security forces men are afraid to return to Russia now, we guarantee that everyone who is detained by our soldiers will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. I spoke today with French President Macron. I briefed him on our activity at the front, about further prospects. We discussed Russian provocations at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the need for immediate demilitarization of the plant and the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from there. I also talked with Mr. President about increasing defense support of our country, about increasing pressure on Russia, in particular about sanctions pressure, about visa restrictions for citizens of the Russian Federation. The arrangements reached during yesterday&#x27;s agreements with Head of the Polish government Morawiecki were developed at a meeting devoted to the issues of support for our Polish brothers during this autumn and winter, our energy cooperation with Poland, as I promised him. I instructed to speed up the reconstruction of the power transmission line from the Khmelnytsky NPP to the Polish city of Rzeszów – the first Savior City. Thank you, Rzeszów. Let me remind that this special title was awarded to Rzeszów back in the spring for extremely important assistance to Ukraine. We must complete this reconstruction by December 8 and provide Poland with the necessary amount of electricity. Of course, all this is possible only if Ukraine maintains normal control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We are working on the international solutions required for this. I also instructed the Cabinet of Ministers to work out the possibility of an urgent supply of 100,000 tonnes of thermal coal to Poland right now. We currently have sufficient volumes for ourselves and can help our brothers prepare for this winter. Today, I welcomed the delegation of UK parliamentarians who arrived in Kyiv. Their negotiations with Head of the Office Andriy Yermak took place – they were very substantive. Among the most important things are security guarantees for Ukraine, our interaction with the UK, as well as the possibilities of our coordination in such regions as, for example, Latin America. We must continue expanding our anti-war coalition. Today, I had a very interesting and useful meeting with Timothy Snyder, a well-known historian, Professor at Yale University and a great friend of Ukraine. Mr. Snyder did a lot to make our country, our people, and our history known and understood in the world. His books are well known to Ukrainian and international readers. And soon there will be another book, he is preparing it now. I was pleased to share some memories of both February 24 and the events of the previous time. We discussed the nature of Russian aggression, propaganda, and the evil that the occupiers are doing. They will definitely be responsible for everything they have done on Ukrainian land. Today, I&#x27;m thankful to the soldiers of the 15th Slavic Regiment of the National Guard of Ukraine, who distinguished themselves in the Kharkiv direction. Well done! I&#x27;m thankful to the troops of the 214th separate rifle battalion for securing the situation in Balakliya, who, together with units of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Special Operations Forces, special forces of the National Guard and the police, returned full control to the city. I&#x27;m thankful to all our defenders, who during these weeks made the approach of the main thing we need – our victory – even more tangible! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Currently, the geopolitical configuration in the world is changing, but the completion of the unification of Europe is impossible without Ukraine - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the annual YES meeting</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-10</span></div>
  <p>Dear attendees! Mr. President Levits! Dear Mr. Prime Minister of our friends - the Republic of Poland, Mr. Morawiecki! Dear participants and guests of the forum! Dear journalists! I am glad to see you all here at the annual meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. This year, we are meeting at the forum in Kyiv again, but still we are the closest to our Yalta in all eight years of the Kyiv YES period and the most united for the sake of Ukrainian interests in all the years of independence of our mighty state. I think you all have this feeling - even confidence. I think you have a feeling that we are coming back and getting stronger. And I’m asking now all of you who are in this hall to express gratitude with applause to our warriors who are bringing our victory and our return home closer. The path to the return of our entire territory is all there, every day it becomes clearer. We see the contours of restoring the territorial integrity of our state. We know that this is a difficult path, but we know that this difficult path is real and we are doing it. But this is the path. The path, on which there are certain difficult stages, and none of them can be bypassed unfortunately. This is a path that requires bravery – all the time. A path that requires endurance all the time as well. A path on which we cannot allow the weakening of our unity, both within the state and the unity of our global anti-war coalition. This is the path from the Kharkiv region, where people who have been under occupation for months are now greeting the Ukrainian soldiers with tears of happiness... The path to those cities and villages of ours that are still waiting strenuously, and also many with tears, because they are living people, for the return of the Ukrainian flag, and therefore, the return of freedom, security, a chance for the future. We cannot afford to stop. This is my main message to anyone out there who is thinking about something. Even to some of the leaders that are pushing us somewhere, into someone&#x27;s inappropriate embrace. No, we cannot afford to stop. The path from this time, when the whole state is fully focused and united for the sake of victory, to that special moment when we will finally be able to feel that the victory has taken place. I know the key question on everyone&#x27;s mind right now is when? When will we pass this path? When will the victory come? The answer to this question can be given by the stage that is right ahead of us. I speak frankly: it will be a difficult stage. We have to endure this winter. I don&#x27;t want to talk in ephemeral numbers, just some words, I&#x27;m talking about specifics. This will be the most difficult winter in the whole world. These will be 90 days that will be a test for our faith in victory. A test for our endurance and unity, for our ability to protect ourselves, the whole world, freedom and fundamental values for any person in the world. Russia is doing everything to break the resistance of Ukraine, the resistance of Europe and the world in 90 days of this winter. Because this is what Russia hopes for. This is its last argument. The last one, I am sure of it: the cruelty of the winter period, which is supposed to help when the cruelty of man is not enough. And we must be ready - not to break down, not to split, not to deviate from our path. There are 90 days ahead, which will be more crucial than 30 years of Ukraine&#x27;s independence. 90 days that will be more crucial than all the years of the existence of the European Union. Winter will determine our future and the risks. We have no doubt in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in our intelligence, in our special services and in all our people - great people of Ukraine in the occupied territory, who are helping Ukrainian warriors liberate our land. But for this to happen, we need specifics - weapons, ammunition, financial and political support, stronger than ever diplomacy, determination at different levels of the world. Therefore, we need the preservation of the unity of our partners and their willingness to help. To help without waiting for us to say that that’s enough. We are grateful for everything you have done, but there will not be enough for victory until there is victory. We have no doubt that we can get through the winter without Russian energy resources. Not only Ukraine, but all reputable European states. But for this to happen, you need to be ready to prevent any Russian sabotage - armed or political, and it is very important to prevent disinformation steps by Russia. And therefore, we need even more coordination, firmness, and pressure on Russia. The world must overcome the price crisis, which Russia is trying to exacerbate with various of its well-known tools - it destabilizes markets, provokes hunger, intimidates people, ordinary people, intimidates them in various countries. And it is possible to protect yourself from this price crisis only through the complete dismantling of Russian influence - influence on European societies, on world markets and on the global information space. It is an ambitious, complex goal, it exists, it is alive, but it is necessary to complete the dismantling of Russian influence now in preparation for winter - before the crucial 90 days. During the autumn, it is necessary to strengthen sanctions on Russia, officials, banks, and companies as much as possible. You know all this. It is necessary to agree on all mechanisms for real limitation of Russian export income. It is necessary to provide all the legal and political bases for the implementation of an international compensation mechanism and the confiscation of Russian assets abroad to compensate for the losses caused by this war to the people of Ukraine. Maximum visa restrictions for the citizens of the Russian Federation are needed to encourage them to launch a visible anti-war movement. Not just populism, but a noticeable movement, noticeable courage. And also the blocking of Russian propaganda and the deportation of all propagandists from all democratic countries - so that Russia does not even have a chance to sow political and social chaos. Chaotization, splits, discord are Russia&#x27;s bet, the bet in their bloody casino, the bet there and then, where and when it cannot use conventional weapons. We must prepare our societies, they must know the truth, for the existing risks. The winter will be difficult for everyone - from Latvia and Poland to Britain and the United States. War is war. It is in the world. Winter will be hard. But we can make this winter the most difficult for Russia, for the one who is responsible for all the created problems - military, social, price problems, energy problems and many others. We can make the path to our victory clearer after these 90 days. Although different societies will have a hard time in the winter, each society should know that after these 90 days, real security begins for decades from all those threats that are so painfully experienced now. When we endure all this, our neighbor will never be able to do anything to all of us. Russia has already embarked on the path of its historic defeat - and the clarity of this path, the contours of its defeat will become obvious after these 90 days. If we are all honest and persevere. All who value peace more than war. Ukrainians, Europeans, the whole world. We see how the countries of our continent are now preparing for the winter. These restrictions are complex - restrictions on energy consumption, restrictions on temperatures in homes for the heating season. The EU already did a lot to protect itself when Russia triggered this energy price shock, and today only 9 percent of gas is supplied to EU countries from Russia. And be sure that Russia will make zero gas supplies, and our energy systems must be fully prepared for this. Every day we try to do everything necessary to protect our sky. This is even more important in the winter, when Russian missiles can and will target enterprises and infrastructure that provide people with heat and electricity. Now is the time for partners to fulfill their promises to help Ukraine with air defense systems. Now is the time to end the Russia-created crisis at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The threat of a radiation disaster is definitely not what the European Union, Turkey and other states - those in the directions of the wind that can spread radiation pollution - should enter the winter with. But something else is also important - the stable operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the framework of the Ukrainian energy system can become one of the key, important elements of guaranteeing stable energy consumption by Europe during these 90 days. We already export electricity to our neighbors, which helps replace dirty Russian energy resources, and we can easily increase exports to at least two and a half gigawatts, and eventually even more. Today we talked about it with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland - they want it, we want it. So we will do it. But for this, it is necessary to ensure that the Russian troops withdraw from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. This is a fundamental European interest now, at this time before winter. Ladies and Gentlemen! When I said that we cannot afford to stop, I did not mean only our heroic warriors who are liberating the Ukrainian land. Now there is a change in the geopolitical configuration in the world as a whole, in Europe. And economic unification in Europe has been achieved. I believe that political unification in Europe has been achieved. This is all obvious at the level of institutions, relations, and everyday life. But now a real value-based unification of the entire continent is being achieved - and, by the way, thanks to Ukraine as well. The last barriers that existed between European countries are disappearing - and this is thanks to the fact that Europe really protects freedom. Europe is gaining real independence. Russia creates the illusion that Europeans must make a choice - such a difficult choice between prices and values, between freedom and security, between independence and peace. But there is no such choice. It is an impossible choice. When values are weak, prices are sky high. When freedom suffers, there is no security. When independence is lost, peace is impossible. Therefore, we must not deviate from our path, we have no right to get tired, God forbid, of Ukraine and stop. All of us - all Ukrainians and all of us Europeans. We must fight. Endure the winter. Help those who are weaker. Protect those who need protection more. Limit ourselves in what can be limited. And limit Russia in everything that should limit it. Give warmth to those whom Russia wants to leave without warmth. And give food to those who are forced by Russia to starve. Continue to fulfill the three fundamental conditions for achieving peace - weapons, ammunition, finances. Support for Ukraine in the war must be maintained. And one more important element. Completing the unification of Europe is impossible without Ukraine. Therefore, this winter we must do absolutely everything to say in the spring: we are fully ready to start negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union. It will be a historic moment, a historic time - when it will be an honor for Europe to welcome our state. The state that wins. Believe in victory! Defend Ukraine! Help our heroes! And we will definitely endure the winter! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I want to dedicate this address to those who have been bravely standing for 200 days, being the exact reason why Ukraine stands - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-11</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today is 200 days of our resistance. Our struggle. Our people’s war. For freedom, for independence, for the right to be. In these 200 days, we have achieved a lot, but the most important, and therefore the most difficult, is ahead. And I want to dedicate this address to those who are ahead. Who are having the hardest time now, as they are doing the most important thing. These are all defenders of Ukraine. All those who have been courageously standing for 200 days, being the exact reason why Ukraine stands. Strong, and that is why we are free. Unbreakable, and that is why we are independent. Our fighters, who heroically restrained the enemy, and now they do not restrain themselves. And they drive the occupiers out in the north, south and east. In all directions, but moving in only one direction - forward and towards victory. 200 days of Ukrainian resistance. Almost 5 thousand hours. Almost 300 thousand minutes. Almost 20 million seconds. And just as many reasons to say &quot;thank you&quot; today to everyone who made this possible. Millions of times. Without any &quot;almost&quot;. To say that we believe in them, believe in their victory. Without any &quot;almost&quot;. These are all our warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ground troops, our infantry. You know better than anyone else: there is little romance in war and a lot of hard work. These days, it is courageously and selflessly performed by our separate mechanized brigades. The 92nd – named after Kish otaman Ivan Sirko. The 54th – named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa. The 14th – named after Prince Roman the Great. The 60th Inhulets separate infantry brigade. Step by step in the Kharkiv region, Kherson region, Donbas, with weapons, shovels, hands, teeth – you are &quot;gnawing away&quot; every meter, every frontier, every city and village of ours. These are our tank troops. Those who forge the future victory in iron gloves. And today, on the day of the professional holiday, as well. These are the 3rd, 4th, 5th separate tank brigades, tank regiments and battalions, tank companies within the airborne assault troops, the 17th separate Kryvyi Rih tank brigade named after Kostiantyn Pestushko. And especially - the 1st separate tank Siversk brigade. I sincerely congratulate all of you and everyone involved on Tanker&#x27;s Day. These are our missile troops and artillery. You are rightfully called the &quot;gods of war&quot;. You send the occupiers to the divine trial. You send the demons back to hell. Today, the 406th separate artillery brigade named after brigadier-general Oleksiy Almazov is doing this with special fervor and spark in their eyes. We are grateful to its fighters and in general to everyone whom we warmly call &quot;our arta&quot;. How would one describe your jewelry work in two words? Accurate and loud. We thank you for every &quot;accurate&quot; and every &quot;loud&quot;. For all destroyed enemy convoys, warehouses, bases and headquarters. Important crossings and bridges. Where your efforts cause fire and where the enemy violated the rules of fire safety. People online wish you accurate calculations and new hits, and they address the occupiers in a language they understand: &quot;Stop smoking everywhere. Smoke where there hasn’t been a hit yet&quot;. These are our Air Forces. Bombing, assault, fighter, reconnaissance, military transport aviation. Defending Ukraine you are always on top. These are our Airborne Assault Troops. You are always the first! Because it is no one but you! These slogans are not just words. The enemy has been aware of this for eight years and 200 days. And today, the occupiers especially feel the strength and power of the 79th airborne assault brigade, the 25th and 80th airborne brigades. In particular, in the Kharkiv region, which you are successfully liberating from the enemies. And in the Donetsk region, where you are successfully repelling the enemy. We are sure: in both areas there will be one finale - your victory. For this, one doesn’t need to read forecasts, it is enough to read your oath. You are the paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. You will never accept defeat. You will never retreat in the face of difficulties. You will never leave your brothers-in-arms in danger. You are always ready to destroy the enemies of Ukraine in battle. You are the paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine! These are our Naval Forces. You proved that it doesn&#x27;t matter what fleet the enemy has, what flagship he has, when Neptune is on your side. Guards of native shores. Missile boats, artillery, minesweeping and landing craft, naval aviation, naval artillery and, of course, marines. And I especially want to note the 503rd separate battalion of the marines. On your chevrons there is an inscription: &quot;If this is an offensive, this is us.&quot; In our hearts there are words: if this is you, this is success and victory. These are the air defense troops of Ukraine. Anti-aircraft missile troops, radio engineering troops, air defense of the Ground and Naval Forces. You hear an air raid alert differently than most. Most descend into shelter. You direct your gaze upwards to destroy enemy missiles, aircraft, helicopters and drones. This is our intelligence. For obvious reasons, very few people know your names, your faces. Your operations are not usually written about in the news, but they will definitely be written about in military science textbooks. Your successes are often quiet and imperceptible to our people, but always painful and tangible to our enemy. These days, intelligence officers are especially showing themselves. The 131st separate reconnaissance battalion of military intelligence of Ukraine. Those who are always ahead. I thank you, I thank all the units of the Main Intelligence Directorate and all our intelligence officers, thanks to whom we always see, always hear, always know, always act. And we will definitely win. These are our special forces, Special Operations Forces. Those who attack. Those who prevail not in quantity, but in quality. Those who have a special power to fight on the edge of possible and impossible. These are the territorial defense forces. And we especially note the fighters of the separate 115th and 117th territorial defense brigades. These are medical troops that save the lives of our warriors. These are military clergy, chaplains who pray for the lives of our warriors. These are our engineers, communications officers, cyber army. These are those who have been defending and serving the state side by side with the Armed Forces of Ukraine for eight years, for 200 days and right now. I thank all the warriors of the National Guard, its special forces, in particular the 15th Sloviansk regiment. I am thankful to all our border guards. To the officers and employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, the State Emergency Service, our firefighters, rescuers, sappers. And altogether - to all our warriors, defenders, the best sons and daughters of Ukraine who are liberating its north, south and east today. To everyone who in 200 days destroyed more than 2,000 enemy tanks, 4,500 armored combat vehicles, more than 1,000 enemy artillery systems, 250 aircraft and 200 helicopters, almost 1,000 drones, 15 ships and boats, thousands of other enemy equipment units. Liberated hundreds of our towns and villages. Who broke the plans of the enemy, because they did not break themselves. All those who held the defense and defended Kyiv. Saved our capital, and thus preserved our faith in our victory. All those who strengthened and multiplied it by protecting Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro. Everyone who defended Mariupol and Azovstal. Liberated the Kyiv region, Zhytomyr region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region. Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Vorzel, Hostomel, Makariv. Okhtyrka, Sumy. And now - Balakliya, Izyum, Kupyansk. All those who liberated, liberate and will liberate all temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Bring back the Ukrainian flag to Kherson, Berdyansk, Melitopol, Luhansk, Horlivka, Yenakijeve, Mariupol and Donetsk, Yalta, Dzhankoy, Kerch, Yevpatoriya, Simferopol. Who have been working 200% all these 200 days. The enemies said that they got lost, that they were going to an exercise. You taught them a lot. The ability to quickly get dressed and get out of our land, and the understanding that, by abandoning equipment and weapons, it can be done much faster and easier. Many of them have forever learned that it is correct to say not &quot;on Ukraine&quot; but &quot;in Ukraine&quot;. I am talking about all those who set foot on our land and stayed in it. Many will forever remember what awaits all uninvited guests in Ukraine. Our warriors. Today, everyone sees and notes your actions in the north, south and east of Ukraine. The world is impressed. The enemy is panicking. Ukraine is proud of you, believes in you, prays for you, and is waiting for you. The path to victory is a difficult one. But we are sure: you are capable of it. You will reach our border, all its sections. You will see our frontiers and the enemies’ backs. You will see the shining of the eyes of our people and of the occupiers’ heels. They will call it &quot;goodwill gestures&quot;. We&#x27;ll call it a victory. We believe in you, in those who have been doing their job, risking their lives, defending their country for all these 200 days at -15°C or +35°C, at 2 am or 6 am, on an ordinary Monday or on Independence Day, despite fatigue, tension and danger. All who were definitely ready. Who do not pay attention to rumors and gossip. Who do not read fakes on the Internet, but write the history in real life. The history of independence. The history of victory. The history of Ukraine. Our warriors, our fighters, our defenders. For us, you are definitely the first army of the world. Glory to you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We still need to strengthen our cooperation with partners to overcome Russian terror – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-12</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All Europeans! And everyone in the world who believes that terror should have no place on earth. Why is the biggest source of terror in the world - Russia - still able to wage this war? And why can it wage the war so cruelly and cynically? There is only one reason - insufficient pressure on Russia. The response to the terror of this state is insufficient. Just look at what Russia can afford. No other terrorist has ever done this in history - so many things at once. Radiation terror at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Six power units! The presence of Russian troops at the plant, constant Russian provocations and shelling of the plant’s territory alone put Ukraine and all of Europe on the brink of a radiation disaster. Energy terror. Residents of many countries around the world are suffering due to the painful increase in prices for energy resources - for electricity, for heat. Russia does it deliberately. It deliberately destabilizes the gas market in Europe. With its strikes it deliberately limits our Ukrainian ability to export electricity to Europe. The export of electricity from Ukraine could alleviate the severity of the energy crisis in Europe in the same way that the export of our food relieves the severity of the food crisis in the world. Hunger terror is a very cynical and completely deliberate tactic of Russia. And it is directed not just against poor countries, but specifically against those regions of the world from which a new inflow of refugees may come to Europe. Severe migrant crisis in Europe - this is the calculation of the terrorist state. Fortunately, together with our partners, together with the UN, Turkey, we managed to achieve an export grain initiative. Russia was forced to unblock our ports. But now it is threatening a blockade again. And how does the world react? There is still no official recognition of Russia as a state - sponsor of terrorism. Citizens of the terrorist state can still travel to Europe for vacation or shopping, they can still get European visas, and no one knows whether there are torturers or murderers among them who have just returned from the occupied territory of Ukraine. Until now, Russian propagandists can still work precisely in those countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, which are threatened with the greatest chaos due to price and energy crises created by Russia. We are still forced to ask for help in protecting our skies from Russian missiles - after 200 days of full-scale war! Yesterday and today, the Russian army struck the Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians found themselves in the dark - without electricity. Houses, hospitals, schools, communal infrastructure... Russian missiles hit precisely those objects that have absolutely nothing to do with the infrastructure of the Armed Forces of our country. On the one hand, this is a sign of the desperation of those who invented this war. This is how they react to the defeat of Russian troops in the Kharkiv region. They can&#x27;t do anything to our heroes on the battlefield, and that&#x27;s why Russia is directing its vile strikes against civilian infrastructure. On the other hand, Russia is trying to prevent us from directing Ukraine&#x27;s capabilities in such a way as to stabilize the situation in Europe. Our electricity export is something that Russia is very afraid of right now. Because we can disrupt Russian plans to empty the pockets of Europeans this winter due to crazy energy prices. We still need to strengthen our cooperation in order to overcome Russian terror. Russia must be designated a terrorist state. Strengthen sanctions - the eighth EU sanctions package is needed. Increase aid to Ukraine, and above all speed up the provision of air defense systems. I am grateful to all the rescuers who fought the consequences of Russian missile strikes at energy facilities. Hundreds of settlements in several regions of Ukraine were cut off due to these strikes. At the request of the Minister of Internal Affairs, today I would like to especially note the contribution to the stabilization of the situation of Major General of the Civil Protection Service Oleksandr Volobuyev, Colonel of the Civil Protection Service Oleksandr Mislavskyi, Senior Lieutenant of the Civil Protection Service Vitaliy Dzyabko, Ensign of the Civil Protection Service Denys Kostenko and fireman, Ensign Oleksandr Gulyi. Thank you. I am grateful to you and your colleagues! The energy supply of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Poltava region, Sumy region, Kharkiv region and the city of Kharkiv was restored. But today there are new strikes at energy facilities. New blackouts in Kharkiv. And we must be aware that the meanness of Russian terrorists knows no bounds - they will try to make such a form of terror systematic. On my behalf, the Prime Minister of Ukraine held a meeting today with the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Territories and Communities Development of Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance and Naftogaz. A coordinating headquarters will be formed to quickly respond to all such manifestations of Russian terror. Funds will also be allocated for the restoration of damaged objects and for assistance to the de-occupied territories. From the beginning of September until today, our warriors have already liberated more than 6,000 square kilometers of the territory of Ukraine - in the east and south. The movement of our troops continues. I am thankful to the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade, which has recovered from heavy fighting in the east and is advancing very bravely, very confidently in the south direction. I am thankful to the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade for steadily moving forward despite everything - despite the features of the open terrain, despite the artillery of the occupiers. I am thankful to the fighters of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade for the liberation of several settlements and very effective actions to neutralize the enemy&#x27;s activity. Guys, you are true heroes! Separately, I want to thank our anti-aircraft fighters today. Yesterday, we all saw the consequences of the Russian strikes. But at the same time, most of the terrorists&#x27; missiles were shot down. Nine of the twelve missiles were shot down. Seven missiles were shot down by warriors of the 138th Dnipro anti-aircraft missile brigade of the &quot;East&quot; air command, and two missiles were shot down by the sky defenders of the 96th Kyiv anti-aircraft missile brigade of the &quot;Center&quot; air command. Thank you, our defenders! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is really ready to fight against Russian terror! We bring victory closer every day. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Together with our troops and our flag, ordinary normal life comes to the de-occupied territory - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-13</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The participants, as before, are Reznikov, Zaluzhny, Syrsky, Kovalchuk, Litvinov, Yermak, Monastyrskyi, Kubrakov, Danilov, Lebid and others. The first and most important issue is the reports of commanders by direction. Oleksandr Syrsky reported on the successes in the Kharkiv region, Andriy Kovalchuk - on the movement of our troops in the south. We considered the draft budget for defense and security for the next year. The situation in the liberated territory of our state was analyzed in detail. As of now, stabilization measures have been completed in the districts with a total area of more than 4,000 square kilometers. Stabilization continues in the liberated territory of approximately the same size. Remnants of occupiers and sabotage groups are being detected, collaborators are being detained and full security is being restored. Border guards are tasked with protecting the state border in the liberated territory. Once again, I thank all our fighters who ensured such a large-scale and quick defeat of the invaders in the territory of the Kharkiv region! By the way, today I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 153 combatants were awarded state awards, 12 of them posthumously. All - for bravery in the battles in the east of our country - in the Kharkiv region, in Donbas. It is very important that together with our troops, with our flag, ordinary normal life comes to the de-occupied territory. As an example, in Balakliya, in Hrakove, the payment of pensions for five months at once, for the time when we simply could not make payments due to the occupation, has already been started. And all Ukrainian pensioners in the liberated territory will receive payments. Ukraine always fulfills its social obligations to people. Today I held a meeting with the Defense Ministers of Denmark and Estonia who arrived in Kyiv. Of course, we talked about further support for our state, about further pressure on Russia. I thanked them for the principled and consistent help in protecting people&#x27;s freedom and life. I held negotiations with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. I thanked her for the allocation of $1.4 billion in additional support for our state. We discussed a new program of cooperation and, in general, the preservation of Ukraine&#x27;s financial stability. We have a result in our work on security guarantees for our state. Today, a package of recommendations was presented by the international group led by Andriy Yermak and Anders Fogh Rasmussen - these are the recommendations that should form the basis of the future system of security treaties that will give Ukrainians peace of mind and guarantee the prevention of any war against Ukraine. We are working to ensure that the strongest subjects of the free world become guarantors of the security of our state. So that at the multilateral and bilateral level, it is stipulated in detail who, how and when should react in case of any threat to the state security of Ukraine. React with sanctions, arms supply, all the necessary material and financial support. The main thing is clear and legally binding steps, specific and timely actions, in particular, preventive actions aimed at preventing war and cooling the aggressor&#x27;s intentions. That is, everything that our country did not have before and because of which Russia had the illusion it could go unpunished for the war against Ukraine. Together with our partners, we have already built a powerful anti-war coalition, which includes dozens of different states. And now we are working to ensure that the most powerful states that are already helping us become a coalition of peace that will last forever. I spoke today with Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. I informed him about the situation on the frontline, about the successes of our state. We always note: in every victory of Ukraine there is also a victory of those who, together with us, defend freedom and European values. Italy is among the strongest. Mr. Draghi and I discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the Russian provocations in great detail. Thank you for understanding that the demilitarization of the ZNPP is a fundamental condition for the return of radiation safety to all of us in Europe. I am grateful to everyone who helps our country expel the occupiers! I am grateful to each of our warriors who do everything to bring victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will respond to the terrorists for each of their vile acts, for each missile – we are capable of that – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-15</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! I’ve returned from the Kharkiv region - from our Kharkiv region, from the districts that were liberated. As of today, almost the entire region is de-occupied. It was an unprecedented movement of our warriors – Ukrainians once again managed to do what many considered impossible. On the first day of active operations alone, our troops advanced 19 kilometers. 110 kilometers were covered in five days of fighting. In total, almost 400 settlements were de-occupied. The 150,000 Ukrainians who remained in this territory feel again now what an ordinary, safe, normal life is like. The Russian army has been in the Kharkiv region for more than five months. And during this time, the occupiers did not even try to do anything for the people. They only destroyed, only deprived, only took away. They left behind devastated villages, and in some of them there is not a single undamaged house. The occupiers left schools turned into garbage dumps, and churches – broken, literally turned into toilets. Journalists - both Ukrainian and foreign journalists - gained access to the liberated areas. The world must see this destruction, must feel the pain that Russia has brought to Ukrainians. Our law enforcement officers already receive reports of murders, tortures and abductions by the occupiers. What the world saw in Bucha, what we saw in the de-occupied territory of the Chernihiv region, Sumy region, and what we are seeing now in the Kharkiv region are evidence of genocide against Ukrainians. Evidence that Russia cannot bring anything else except for genocide. And I will speak in Russian to &quot;comrades&quot;. Your missile attacks today, Russian missiles targeting Kryvyi Rih, the dam of the Karachunivske Reservoir, the objects that have no military value at all, in fact hitting hundreds of thousands of ordinary civilians, is another reason why Russia will lose. And not just this war, but history itself. History is written by people, never by savages. Who will you remain in history? All those who launch these missiles. Those who came to our land. Weaklings. You are weaklings waging a war against civilians. Scoundrels who, having fled the battlefield, are trying to do harm from somewhere far away. You will remain terrorists whom their own grandchildren will be ashamed of. Events show that the only way out for Russian soldiers is to surrender to Ukrainian forces. This is the only option that guarantees them life and attitude in accordance with all conventions. Every Russian soldier should have already understood that only in Ukrainian captivity will no one use him as cannon fodder in a war that is obviously losing for Russia. At the site of the missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, everything is being done to eliminate the consequences of this yet another Russian vile act. A vile act, which may please insane Russian propagandists, but will certainly not save the moral and psychological state of Russian soldiers. They understood that the Russian command is incompetent, and that a rout awaits them in Ukraine on all fronts. Russia will not fix this with any terror, as terror only confirms the weakness of the one who resorts to it. Today in Izyum, I awarded our heroes. It was an honor for me to present state awards on this very land to those who liberated this land. I am grateful to the warriors of the 14th and 92nd separate mechanized brigades, the 25th separate airborne brigade, the 80th separate airborne assault brigade - everyone who in just five days forced the enemy to retreat in panic, abandoning equipment, ammunition, numerous Russian flags. I am grateful to the 107th MLRS brigade, the 40th, 43rd, 44th separate artillery brigades, the 26th artillery brigade. I want to thank the 15th separate artillery reconnaissance brigade - all the warriors who ensured the timely destruction of enemy targets and the advance of our ground units. And, of course, I am grateful to the fighters of the Main Intelligence Directorate, all who skillfully turned the enemy&#x27;s panic into real hysteria. I am grateful to Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrsky and the officers of his staff - everyone who planned and successfully conducted the military operation to liberate the Kharkiv region. The Ukrainian flag will return to all parts of our country. Just like in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian warriors will be met in Donbas, in the south, and in Crimea. It will happen, it will definitely happen. I also held a meeting today in Kharkiv regarding the energy situation in the city and the region. We take into account the fact that the terrorist state can resort to any new vile acts. All levels of Ukrainian authorities - both central and local, rescue services, energy companies, transporters - are tasked with preparing for any scenarios. Reserves for energy, heat and water supply are needed - for all possible cases. We are preparing for tomorrow&#x27;s active day. We are waiting for the news from the frontline. There will be diplomatic news from Kyiv - President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen is paying a visit. Today was almost a Ukrainian day in Brussels. For the first time in the history of the European Union, a state from outside the EU was actually represented at a special session of the European Parliament during the annual State of the EU Report - this is our state. So far - from outside the EU. We are working for full membership – politically, legally, symbolically. The First Lady of Ukraine was present during this annual report of the President of the European Commission. We have an important result of this visit - one hundred million euros for the reconstruction of 74 schools in Ukraine in the framework of the Fast Recovery Plan. We will do everything to implement a large-scale social initiative - cancellation of roaming charges for our people in the EU and for Europeans in Ukraine. This will be a strong signal of our rapprochement. And I thank Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, I thank all our friends in the European Union for their unwavering support. I am thankful to all our warriors! I am thankful to everyone who participates in the rescue operations after the Russian strikes. We will respond to the terrorists for each of their vile acts, for each missile, for each projectile. We are capable of that. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must show that there will be a tough and principled reaction to every manifestation of Russian terror - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-15</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today in Kyiv, a new plaque dedicated to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen was unveiled on the Walk of the Brave. It was really a great honor and simply a pleasure for me to take part in this unveiling, in the recognition of Mrs. Ursula&#x27;s bravery. She is one of the central figures of the European policy towards Ukraine, she is one of those thanks to whom the European space and European values are now really being protected. Today Mrs. Ursula has visited our country for the third time since February 24. And every time her visits open a new stage in the rapprochement of Ukraine and the European Union. We discussed all the key points in our relations. But now I want to highlight the issue of integration, the movement of our country towards full membership in the EU. Whatever the circumstances, we will still implement every detail of our arrangements to open the possibility of membership negotiations. Already in November, we are to fulfill the seven recommendations of the European Commission, which we received when we obtained the candidate status. The assessment by the European Commission of our progress in integration should begin as soon as possible. And next year, we should clarify the key issue: when we can start membership negotiations. The Ukrainian side will do everything for this. And as elements of rapprochement, we consider such things as the regime of the EU internal market for Ukraine, as the unification of our institutional work, for example, at customs - in joint customs control between Ukraine and EU countries. We are already working on this. Today I thanked Mrs. Ursula for the support already provided – macro-financial, sanctions, defense. We also discussed energy cooperation, which is extremely important for Ukraine and for every EU country on the eve of this winter, which Russia will try to use against all of us in Europe. I told about a new and particularly vile tactic of Russian terrorists - attacks on energy and hydrotechnical infrastructure. Just during the stay of the President of the European Commission in Ukraine, the Russian army launched new missile attacks on Kryvyi Rih, on the Kirovohrad region. In both cases - on hydrotechnical structures. The purpose of these strikes is completely clear. These are attacks on people, on the normality of life in Ukraine. The terrorist state is trying to show that it can allegedly compensate with such strikes for the cowardice and incompetence of its military, for the failure of its efforts to avoid sanctions and economic isolation. In response, we must show that there will always be a tough and principled reaction to every manifestation of Russian terror. That is why the eighth EU sanctions package is needed - we talked about it with Mrs. Ursula. A principled decision by the United States of America regarding the terrorist state, the legal recognition of this status is also needed, and we discussed this, by the way, recently during the visit of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Kyiv. We also discuss this issue during contacts with congressmen. Progress is needed in providing Ukraine with air defense systems. We already have agreements with certain countries, our diplomats are working with others. I want to emphasize that without providing us with a sufficient number of sufficiently effective air defense systems that will protect the Ukrainian skies, Russia will continue to feel impunity and provoke new local and global crises. Therefore, protecting Ukraine from Russian missiles is truly a basic element of global security. In general, supporting Ukraine with weapons, ammunition and finances is crucial for peace in Europe. The better support we have, the sooner this war will end. I talked about it with the representatives of the leading think tanks of Poland, Britain, France and the US who arrived in Kyiv. Real protection of freedom and common values of the free world is possible now only as a result of Ukraine&#x27;s victory in this war. I also spoke about further support for Ukraine with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. As always, very substantive, specific. We discussed various security issues, including Russian missile strikes, defense assistance, training of our military, prospects for the developments on the battlefield, restoration of critical infrastructure before the winter period. I am grateful to Mr. Prime Minister for the support already provided to us, in particular financial, for the funds for the purchase of gas. And for understanding the steps we need to take to ruin Russia&#x27;s terrorist plans. An important IAEA resolution was adopted today - a resolution demanding that Russia cease all actions against the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant at the plant itself, at any other nuclear facility in Ukraine. Although international organizations are often limited in their ability to respond, we see that the IAEA clearly identifies the source of radiation danger, namely: the Russian military presence at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, Russian actions against the nuclear power plant. Therefore, the complete demilitarization of the plant, the immediate withdrawal of all Russian troops from there is the only thing that can ensure the implementation of this IAEA resolution. And this is also a basic element of global security. As long as Russian soldiers remain at the nuclear power plant, the world remains on the brink of a radiation disaster – worse than even Chornobyl. And it is the joint responsibility of everyone in Europe and the world - to remove the Russian presence from the territory of the ZNPP. Today I want to thank all the representatives of the State Emergency Service, utility services, construction workers, police officers, military personnel, representatives of local authorities, business representatives - everyone who is involved in eliminating the consequences of Russian missile terror, who helps those who suffered from the strikes. In Kryvyi Rih and the Kirovohrad region, in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, in Mykolaiv and the Donetsk region - in all the cities and communities that Russia tortures with its missiles. The terrorist state has already used more than 3,800 different missiles against us. But no missile will bring Russia closer to its goal. There will be no subjugation of Ukraine. And each missile brings Russia closer to greater international isolation, greater economic degradation and even clearer historical condemnation. And finally. A mass burial site was found in Izyum, Kharkiv region. The necessary procedural actions have already begun there. There should be more information - clear, verified information - tomorrow. Tomorrow there will be Ukrainian and international journalists in Izyum. We want the world to know what is really happening and what the Russian occupation has led to. Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izyum... Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for that. The world must hold Russia to real account for this war. We will do everything for this. Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken away by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia repeats in Izium what it did in Bucha, world must react to it – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-09-16</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! In Kharkiv region, investigative actions are ongoing in the areas that were liberated from the Russian occupation. All the crimes of the Ruscists are being recorded, evidence of their guilt is being collected. Torture chambers where civilians of occupied cities and towns were abused, premises where people were kept – even foreigners – were found. In particular, seven citizens of the Republic of Sri Lanka, students of the Kupyansk Medical College. Back in March, they were captured by Russian soldiers and subsequently kept these people in the basement. Only now, after the liberation of Kharkiv region, these people were saved, they are provided with proper medical care. Exhumation of bodies continues at a mass burial site near Izium. As of now, more than 440 graves have been found. It is too early to say about the number of people buried there, investigations are ongoing. There is already clear evidence of torture, humiliating treatment of people... Moreover, there is evidence that Russian soldiers, whose positions were not far from this place, shot at the buried just for fun. The world must react to all this. Russia has repeated in Izium what it did in Bucha. And now we have just begun to learn the full truth about what was happening in Kharkiv region at that time. It is good that the UN units are already preparing a group of employees who will visit this place near Izium, who will see and be able to report to everyone in the UN system about what the Russian terrorists did. We will ensure full access of journalists to the liberated territory and all places of human abuse. We will provide access to tell the world that ruscism must be condemned. I thank all our partners, all leaders and just our ordinary people who help fight for justice. Fight for the official recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, for the strengthening of sanctions against Russia for this terror. I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Headquarters today. As always, key leaders of the defense and security sector, key representatives of the central government, who ensure the implementation of the defense plan, attended it. Commanders of operative forces reported on the situation on the front line. In addition to completely understandable issues and solutions, the topic of advanced weapons, which will significantly strengthen our army, was also touched upon. I spoke today with the President of Finland. I thanked us for the support we have already received and outlined the additional needs we have. An important topic of conversation was the European policy regarding visas for citizens of the terrorist state. I believe that for every country that shares a common border with Russia, the visa issue is vital and should be resolved in favor of a complete restriction of access for Russian citizens. I also spoke today with representatives of the Nike company. I thanked them for the decision to leave the Russian market. The right decision. This is an example of how business can play a significant role in protecting humanity and freedom. If a state chooses the path of terror, it is the duty of every self-respecting company to distance itself from such a state. Today, a meeting of the group led by Andriy Yermak working on Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development took place in the Office, a meeting with the G7 ambassadors and other partner states. This is an extremely important direction, which is important both in the context of European integration and in the context of the internal transformation of our state. During the meeting, the diplomats were given the details of our initiative to create an ad hoc international tribunal to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. I&#x27;m thankful to the G7 representatives and other partner countries for their willingness to support Ukraine! And one more thing. This Saturday we celebrate Rescuer&#x27;s Day – a professional holiday of those who dedicated their lives to saving others. And it is also the day of those who, under certain circumstances and thanks to their decency and courage, became a rescuer by helping someone else. Today, I honored such people with state awards. And, of course, tomorrow in the evening address I will say more about it. But I want right now, without waiting for tomorrow evening, to congratulate everyone who performs this noble work, who saves people. I want to thank you for the thousands of saved lives, for the security you are returning to us, all Ukrainians. Eternal glory to all who care about people! Please always help each other, always keep unity in everything. We must stick together, all Ukrainians, and that&#x27;s how we will win. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today, several of our cities should celebrate their days – the day of the city. In particular, Kherson and Berdiansk, which still remain under the control of the occupiers. Yet. No matter what forces the occupiers spent on them, no matter what they said there, our Kherson and our Berdiansk never lost their Ukrainian soul, never lost their faith in Ukraine. And we do not forget them for a single moment and will definitely return. Just like Kyiv region, Chernihiv region and Sumy region, just like now Kharkiv region, we will liberate other regions and all our land. Wherever there is Ukraine, there will be our flag and nowhere will this atrocity remain – ruscism that repeats what the Nazis did. They don&#x27;t make soap out of people, they don&#x27;t make lampshades out of leather... The scale is not the whole of Europe... But the principle is the same. Camps where people are gathered to kill. Deportations. Burnt cities and villages, completely destroyed – nothing remains alive after ruscism. Missile terror. Mass burials. Executioners. The cruelest torture of people still alive. And the boundless, undisguised hatred with which they justify this war that they started. Exhumation work continued today in Izium, Kharkiv region, at the site of the mass burial that had been found. Examinations of the bodies are being conducted. New evidence of the torture used against the people buried there has been found. More than ten torture chambers have already been found in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region – in various cities and towns. As the occupiers fled, they also dropped the devices for torture. Even at the ordinary railway station in Kozacha Lopan, a room for torture and tools for electric torture were found. It&#x27;s just a railway station! Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territory. That&#x27;s what the Nazis did. This is what ruscists do. And they will answer in the same way – both on the battlefield and in courtrooms. We will identify all those who tortured, who humiliated, who brought this atrocity from Russia here, to our Ukrainian land. The situation on the front line has not undergone significant changes over the past day. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, units of our intelligence, SBU, National Guard are gradually, step by step, pushing the occupiers out of our land. But we still need time, we still need effort, we still need to be fully focused on defense and keep all our strength. Many of the Russian soldiers have already realized that they have no chance in Ukraine, that they will be defeated. The most intelligent of the Russian military are surrendered, and we guarantee them compliance with all rights according to the conventions. And we will continue pressing so that all the occupiers understand this. We will beat them harder than before. I&#x27;m thankful to all our soldiers – from commanders to privates! I&#x27;m thankful to everyone who helps our defense! I&#x27;m thankful to all partners who support the investigation of the crimes of the occupiers and work with us to hold Russia accountable for this war and its consequences! And I thank everyone who helps restore normal life after our heroes liberate our land! Now the liberated areas of Kharkiv region can finally live – food and medicine are delivered, energy supply is restored, pensions have been brought, we are restoring the operation of transport and railways. The time will come – we will also rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. And there will be a day when I will be able to say this about each of our cities that are still under occupation. And about Kherson, and about Berdiansk, and about Donetsk, and about Luhansk, and about Mariupol. Of course, about Crimea. Ukraine will return. Ukraine will win! Glory to Ukraine!</p>
