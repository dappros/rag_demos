  <h2>Nowadays humanity must act in full solidarity to save lives - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s speech during the General Debate of the UN General Assembly</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-19</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much! I welcome all who stand for common efforts! And I promise – being really united we can guarantee fair peace for all nations. What’s more, unity can prevent wars. Ladies and gentlemen! Mr. Secretary General! Fellow leaders! This hall saw many wars but not as an active defender against the aggressions. In many cases, the fear of war, the final war, was the loudest here – the war after which no one would gather in the General Assembly Hall again. The Third World War was seen as a nuclear war. A conflict between states on the highway to nukes. Other wars seemed less scary compared to a threat of the so-called “great powers” firing their nuclear stockpiles. So, the 20th century taught the world to restrain from the use of the weapons of mass destruction – not to deploy, not to proliferate, not to threaten with, and not to test, but to promote a complete nuclear disarmament. Frankly, this is a good strategy. But it should not be the only strategy to protect the world from this final war. Ukraine gave up its third largest nuclear arsenal. The world then decided Russia should become a keeper of such power. Yet, history shows it was Russia who deserved nuclear disarmament the most, back in the 1990s. And Russia deserves it now – terrorists have no right to hold nuclear weapons. No right! But truly not the nukes are the scariest now. While nukes remain in place, the mass destruction is gaining its momentum. The aggressor is weaponizing many other things and those things are used not only against our country but against all of yours as well. Fellow leaders! There are many conventions that restrict weapons but there are no real restrictions on weaponization. First, let me give you an example – the food. Since the start of the full-scale war, the Ukrainian ports in the Black and Azov Seas have been blocked by Russia. Until now, our ports on the Danube River remain the target for missiles and drones. And it is a clear Russia’s attempt to weaponize the food shortage on the global market in exchange for recognition for some, if not all, of the captured territories. Russia is launching the food prices as weapons. The impact spans from the Atlantic coast of Africa to Southeast Asia. This is the threat scale. I would like to thank those leaders who supported our Black Sea Grain Initiative, and program “Grain from Ukraine”. Thank you so much! United, we made weapons turn back into food again. More than 45 nations saw how important it is to make Ukrainian food products available on the market… from Algeria and Spain to Indonesia and China. Even now when Russia has undermined the Black Sea Grain Initiative, we are working to ensure food stability. And I hope that many of you will join us in these efforts. We launched a temporary sea export corridor from our ports. And we are working hard to preserve the land routes for grain exports. And it is alarming to see how some in Europe, some of our friends in Europe, play out solidarity in a political theater – making a thriller from the grain. They may seem to play their own role but in fact they are helping set the stage to a Moscow actor. Second, weaponization of energy. Many times, the world has witnessed Russia using energy as a weapon. The Kremlin weaponized oil and gas to weaken the leaders of other countries when they came to the Red Square. Now the threat is even greater. Russia is weaponizing nuclear energy. Not only is it spreading its unreliable nuclear-power-plant-construction-technologies, but it is also turning other countries’ power plants into real dirty bombs. Look please what Russia did to our Zaporizhzhia power plant – shelled it, occupied it and now blackmails others with radiation leaks. Is there any sense to reduce nuclear weapons when Russia is weaponizing nuclear power plants? Scary question. The global security architecture offers no response or protection against such a treacherous radiation threat. And there is no accountability for radiation blackmailers so far. The third example is children. Unfortunately, various terrorist groups abduct children to put pressure on their families and societies. But never before would mass kidnapping and deportation become a part of the government policy. Not until now. We know the names of tens of thousands of children and have evidence on hundreds of thousands of others kidnapped by Russia in the occupied territories of Ukraine and later deported. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for this crime. We are trying to get children back home but time goes by. What will happen to them? Those children in Russia are taught to hate Ukraine, and all ties with their families are broken… This is clearly a genocide. When hatred is weaponized against one nation, it never stops there. Each decade Russia starts a new war. Parts of Moldova and Georgia remain occupied. Russia turned Syria into ruins. And if it hadn&#x27;t been for Russia, the chemical weapons would have never been used there in Syria. Russia has almost swallowed Belarus. It is obviously threatening Kazakhstan and the Baltic states… And the goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you – against the international rules-based order. Many seats in the General Assembly Hall may become empty if Russia succeeds with its treachery and aggression. Ladies and gentlemen! The aggressor scatters death and brings ruins even without nukes but the outcomes are alike. We see towns and villages in Ukraine wiped out by Russian artillery. Leveled to the ground completely! We see the war of drones. We know the possible effects of spreading the war into cyberspace. The artificial intelligence could be trained to combat well – before it would learn to help the humanity. Thank God, people have not yet learned to use climate as a weapon. Even though humanity is failing on its climate policy objectives – this means that extreme weather will still impact normal global life and some evil state will also weaponize its outcomes. And when people in the streets of New York and other cities of the world went out on climate protest – we all have seen them… And when people in Morocco and Libya and other countries die as a result of natural disasters… And when islands and countries disappear under water… And when tornadoes and deserts are spreading into new territories… And when all of this is happening one unnatural disaster in Moscow decided to launch a big war and kill tens of thousands of people. We have to stop it! We must act united – to defeat the aggressor and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing these challenges. As nukes are restrained, likewise the aggressor must be restrained and all its tools and methods of war. Each war now can become final, but it takes our unity to make sure that aggression will not break in again. And it is not a dialog between the so-called “great powers” somewhere behind the closed doors that can guarantee us all the new no-wars-era, but open work of all nations for peace. Last year, I presented the outlines of the Ukrainian Peace Formula at the UN General Assembly. Later in Indonesia, I presented the full Formula. And over the past year the Peace Formula became the basis to update the existing security architecture – now we can bring back to life the UN Charter and guarantee the full power of the rules-based world order. Tomorrow I will present the details at a special meeting of the UN Security Council. The main thing is that it is not only about Ukraine. More than 140 states and international organizations have supported the Ukrainian Peace Formula fully or in part. The Ukrainian Peace Formula is becoming global. Its points offer solutions and steps that will stop all forms of weaponization that Russia used against Ukraine and other countries and may be used by other aggressors. Look – for the first time in modern history, we have a real chance to end the aggression on the terms of the nation which was attacked. This is a real chance for every nation – to ensure that aggression against your state, if it happens, God forbid, will end not because your land will be divided and you will be forced to submit to military or political pressure, but because your territory and sovereignty will be fully restored. We launched the format of meetings between national security advisors and diplomatic representatives. Important talks and consultations were held in Hiroshima, in Copenhagen, and in Jeddah on the implementation of the Peace Formula. And we are preparing a Global Peace Summit. I invite all of you – all of you who do not tolerate any aggression – to jointly prepare the Summit. I am aware of the attempts to make some shady dealings behind the scenes. Evil cannot be trusted – ask Prigozhin if one bets on Putin’s promises. Please, hear me. Let unity decide everything openly. While Russia is pushing the world to the final war, Ukraine is doing everything to ensure that after Russian aggression no one in the world will dare to attack any nation. Weaponization must be restrained. War crimes must be punished. Deported people must come back home. And the occupier must return to their own land. We must be united to make it. And we will do it. Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>To prevent turmoil on the global food market, we can establish grain hubs – Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s speech at the SDG Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-19</span></div>
  <p>Fellow colleagues! Ladies and gentlemen! Glad to take part in the Summit. It might seem a bit strange to discuss sustainable development when the only sustainable thing is that this world is unpredictable. But it is not the case. Our solidarity can make things predictable. Ukraine will never give up its role as a guarantor of global food security. Nobody expected from us that we could press the Russian fleet out of our Black Sea waters, providing more room for the Black Sea Grain Initiative as well as humanitarian initiative – Grain from Ukraine. And the results are truly remarkable. Ukraine food exports have reached the shores of Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, Libya, Lebanon, Morocco, Somalia, Tunisia, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, Iraq, Oman, Pakistan, Türkiye, Yemen, and others. The roads from intermediary ports have carried our products to Ethiopia and Sudan. This was a total of 32 million tons of food. This is 32 million tons less chaos. I thank all those leaders who supported our export programs. Thank you very much, guys! We have made it. And nothing prevents us from reaching far more ambitious goals. Ukraine proposes a very clear action. To prevent any turmoil on the global food market, we can establish hubs for millions tons of grain per year in especially sensitive areas, for example in ports of Africa. We already started to negotiate such possibilities. No matter what the problem is, cooperation can give decisions. And the world has all necessary resources to sort all problems out and at the same time to push the global development. Ukraine at war shows remarkable results, the world in cooperation can make so much more. Not talking, not waiting – acts change the world, acts translate goals into life. And the life we need depends only on us. Thank you for your attention, thank you for all the support, real friends! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>The use of veto power requires reform, and this can be a key reform in the UN – address by the President of Ukraine at the UN Security Council meeting</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-20</span></div>
  <p>Distinguished Prime Minister Rama! I am grateful to the Albanian Presidency for arranging this meeting. Mr. Secretary-General! Ladies and gentlemen! Five hundred seventy-four days of pain, losses, and struggle have already passed since the start of the full-scale aggression launched by the state, which, for some reason, is still present here among the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Russia has killed at least tens of thousands of our people and turned millions into refugees by destroying their homes. Most of the world recognizes the truth about this war. It is a criminal and unprovoked aggression by Russia against our nation, aimed at seizing Ukraine&#x27;s territory and resources. But it is not just that. With its aggression, the terrorist state is willing to undermine all the dams of international norms meant to protect the world from wars. And I am grateful to all those who have recognized the Russian aggression as a violation of the UN Charter. Ukraine exercises its inherent right of self-defense. Helping Ukraine with weapons in this exercise, imposing sanctions and exerting comprehensive pressure on the aggressor, as well as voting for relevant resolutions, mean helping to defend the UN Charter. The resolutions of the General Assembly have clearly recognized the fact that the only source of this war is Russia. But, this has changed nothing for Russia in the United Nations. However, these are the situations that have changed everything for the UN. We should acknowledge that the Organization finds itself in a deadlock on the issue of aggression. Humankind no longer pins its hopes on the UN when it comes to the defense of the sovereign borders of nations. World leaders are seeking new platforms and alliances that could reduce the disastrous scope of problems. Those problems that are met here, within these walls, with rhetoric, rather than real solutions, with aspirations to compromise with killers, rather than to protect lives. Life should be defended uncompromisingly to ensure successful protection. But I would not be here today if Ukraine had no proposals precisely regarding solutions. Yesterday, in my address to the UN General Assembly, I said that the Ukrainian Peace Formula had become the basis to update the existing security architecture in the world, in particular – to restore the real power of the UN Charter and the rules-based international order. Now I would like to present the details – concrete possible actions based on the Peace Formula, notably its point 5 “Implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity and the world order”. All in the world see what makes the UN incapable unfortunately. This seat in the Security Council, which Russia occupied illegally, through backstage manipulations following the collapse of the Soviet Union, has been taken by liars whose job is to whitewash the aggression and genocide being carried out by Russia. And all the UN actions – either by the Security Council or the General Assembly – that could have stopped this aggression, are shattered by the privilege granted by this seat to the aggressor. Veto power in the hands of the aggressor is what has pushed the UN into a dead end. Today, no matter what nation you might be… A nation with hundreds of millions of people or a small nation… A nation that bravely defends its independence or a country whose long history of independence can help others… A state in need of help or a nation that can provide genuine support… A state that relies on its army, or a state for which the UN Charter, not its army, is the first and last line of defense… Regardless of who you are, the current UN system still makes you less influential than the veto power possessed by a few and misused by one – Russia – to the detriment of all other UN members. These days, the word &quot;inequality&quot; has often been heard in the UN General Assembly. Inequality is mentioned by different nations – both larger and smaller ones. It is precisely inequality that renders the UN ineffective now. I regret that so far the UN Security Council is just the most visible platform in the world. I believe that the UN is capable of more. I am confident that the UN Charter can actually work for global peace and security. However, for this to happen, the years-long discussions of projects for UN reform must be translated into a viable process of UN reform. And it should not be only about representation here, in the Security Council. The use of veto power – that is what requires reform, and this can be a key reform. This can be what restores the power of the UN Charter. Ladies and gentlemen! Five hundred seventy-four days of the full-fledged Russian aggression are five hundred seventy-four reasons for changes in this Chamber. And the number of votes in favor of these changes actually amounts to billions. The absolute majority of people in the world aspire to live in a world free of aggression. In contrast to all of us, there are only a few obsessed individuals in Moscow. Veto should not serve as a weapon for those who are obsessed with hatred and war. What we observe in the United Nations is an increasing support for the idea that in cases of mass atrocities veto power should be voluntarily suspended. But we also observe that Russia will not give up this stolen privilege voluntarily. So, the UN General Assembly should be given a real power to overcome the veto. This will be the first necessary step. If it is impossible to stop the war because all efforts are vetoed by the aggressor or those who condone the aggressor, it is necessary to bring this issue to the attention of the General Assembly. In the event of two-thirds of the votes reflecting the will of nations from Asia, Africa, Europe, both Americas, and the Pacific region – a global qualified majority – the veto should be effectively overcome, and such resolution of the General Assembly must be legally binding for all Member States. The second step. The UN Security Council must be fully accountable to the nations of the world. I welcome the proposals of various leaders to expand the representation of nations in the Security Council. The composition of the permanent members of the Security Council should reflect the current realities and justice. Ukraine considers it unjust when billions of people do not have their permanent representation in the Security Council. The African Union must be here permanently. Asia deserves broader permanent representation – it cannot be considered normal when nations like Japan, India or the Islamic world remain outside the permanent membership of the Security Council. One should take into account the changes that have taken place in Europe, notably that Germany has become one of the key global guarantors of peace and security. This is a matter of fact. Therefore, it is also a matter of fact that Germany deserves a place among the permanent members of the Security Council. Latin America must be represented here – permanently. And the Pacific states. However, we should not confine our attention to those in the top seats only. There is a need to expand the participation and access to the activities of the UN Security Council and its subsidiary bodies for all members of the UN General Assembly who are not recognized as aggressors. At the same time, the Security Council’s membership of any state should be suspended for a period of time when such a state resorts to aggression against another nation in violation of the UN Charter. The third step. There is a need for a system to prevent aggression through early response to actions violating territorial integrity and sovereignty of states. It&#x27;s time to do this. Nations of the world should agree on such a mechanism for responding to aggression to protect others, that everyone would want for their own security. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown what can such a mechanism be. Among other things, powerful sanctions against the aggressor. Not only at the stage when Bucha has already happened, but also at the stage of the build-up of an invasion army. Anyone who wants to start a war should see before their fatal mistake what exactly they will lose when they start a war. The issue of applying such preventive sanctions should be automatically submitted for consideration of the UN Security Council when any Member of the UN General Assembly reports a threat of aggression. Ukrainian soldiers are currently doing at the expense of their blood what the UN Security Council should do by its voting – they are stopping aggression and upholding the principles of the UN Charter. And now, I would like to focus on territorial integrity. This is an element of both the UN Charter and our Peace Formula that is inextricably linked to the issue of clearing the territory from the occupiers. Occupation is an inexhaustible source of dynamite under the international rules-based order. So, I will provide examples of concrete steps to be taken for the security architecture to be strong. Using Ukraine as an example. Concrete things. Concrete as we, Ukrainians, are. First: full withdrawal of all Russian troops and military formations, including the Russian Black Sea Fleet or its leaky remnants, as well as the withdrawal of all mercenaries and paramilitary formations of Russia from the entire sovereign territory of Ukraine within our internationally recognized borders as of 1991. Second: full restoration of Ukraine’s effective control over the entire state border and exclusive economic zone, including in the Black and Azov Seas, as well as in the Kerch Strait. In fact, only the implementation of these two points will result in an honest, reliable, and complete cessation of hostilities. Ladies and gentlemen! As a rule, reforms of such international institutions were made following major tragedies, major wars. We should not wait for this aggression to be over. Action is needed now. Our aspiration for peace should drive the reform. When I was preparing the Ukrainian Peace Formula, I underpinned its points exclusively by the principles of the UN Charter and resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. This is precisely what enables the global nature of the Ukrainian Peace Formula. Nations that engage with the Formula realize that they are working for the rules-based international order – for the protection of territorial integrity and sovereignty of states, protection of human rights, prevention of aggression and genocidal policy. Naturally, the epicenter of such efforts should be in this very Chamber – the UN Security Council Chamber, and even to a greater extent, in the General Assembly Hall. If reform of UN institutions is necessary for this, then we should not be afraid of such reform. We are ready to work together with those UN members, who have joined the Peace Formula, on relevant draft resolutions and amendments to the UN Charter. And I would like to make it clear for everyone in the world, what exactly Ukraine is proposing while addressing the nations of the world and calling on them to join the implementation of the Peace Formula. Each country can demonstrate its leadership within the framework of one or more or all points of the Peace Formula. On the basis of the points of the Peace Formula we form groups, where national security advisors to heads of state and diplomatic representatives work. These groups are tasked to elaborate a list of decisions and legislative proposals, requiring implementation to fulfill the relevant point of the Peace Formula. We are ready to hold the inaugural Summit of the Leaders, subsequently, ten conferences at the level of advisors, diplomatic representatives, heads of parliaments in accordance with the ten points of the Peace Formula. Later, these drafts prepared by advisors will be submitted for consideration by heads of state at the respective final Summit. Thereby, all nations of the world that respect peace can actually participate in the restoration of peace. Cooperation is always the key word for Ukraine in international relations. This word is also key for peace. So, let peace prevail! May our institutions and our cooperation be stronger. I thank you for the opportunity to deliver this address. Thank you for the invitation and your attention! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>We will work together for Ukraine to produce the necessary weapons together with America - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-22</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! It was a very important visit to Washington, with very significant results. I met with President Biden and his team. There is a new defense package: air defense, artillery, shells, engineering equipment. There is also a long-term agreement – we will work together for Ukraine to produce the necessary weapons together with the United States. This is a new level of our unity! Co-production in the defense industry with the United States is a historic thing. A new industrial base, new jobs for both our nations. In particular, Ukraine will be able to produce air defense systems. We are preparing to create a new defense ecosystem together with the United States to produce weapons to further reinforce freedom and the protection of life together. This will yield global positive results. Thank you, Mr. President Biden! I thank the Congress – both parties, both houses. Today, I started my day in the American capital with the Congress – with very frank, detailed conversations. I felt trust – trust that is always the basis of unity. There were clear, straightforward questions from members of the House of Representatives and senators. There were straightforward answers. It is a priority for Ukraine to have the necessary transparency in our relations with America. There were meetings today at the Pentagon as well – important conversations about defense support. Important agreements were reached. Government officials have been quite busy. In particular, today the Ministry for Strategic Industries, Minister Kamyshin, signed cooperation agreements with three key associations. More than 2,000 defense companies are American companies. We are engaging them to work in Ukraine. We have a memorandum on energy cooperation. Today we discussed fundamental things about Ukraine&#x27;s recovery after the hostilities. We also discussed strengthening our state&#x27;s institutions to clear Ukraine of any hostile and corrupt influences. There is a value-based decision to return to Ukraine the artifacts stolen by the occupiers - items from the Scythian period. The First Lady had some important events today. She met with the First Lady of America, Jill Biden. Georgetown University – meeting with students, expanding our cultural diplomacy. The 40th Ukrainian bookshelf. Then in the evening, together with Olena, we addressed all Americans – political leaders, members of Congress, and ordinary Americans who have done so many extraordinary things to help our people, Ukrainian children, our Ukrainian families, and our warriors. Thank you, United States, thank you, America! And we keep working to strengthen Ukraine. Thank you to everyone who helps us! Glory to all our warriors! We will definitely prevail! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by the President and the First Lady of Ukraine to the U.S. government and business representatives, media and Ukrainian community</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-22</span></div>
  <p>President: Please… First Lady: Thank you. Dear friends! Volodymyr and I have never made such addresses before. But never before has our country had such reasons to be grateful. There were different times in the long history of the Ukrainian people. Ukrainians did not stop fighting for freedom – this is in the character of our men and women. Equally. Now I am not afraid that Ukrainian freedom will fall. In general, freedom will never fall again. The world can be sure of that, because it can be confident in America. President: This Monday, after arriving in New York, my team and I immediately went to Staten Island – to the hospital where our guys – our heroes, who were seriously wounded in battles, are recovering. Soldiers, sailors, sergeants… Ordinary guys. Some of them are now learning to walk again. They get used to prostheses. But they are the ones who would not agree to the occupation. They are strong guys – with brave spirit. I am proud of our soldiers! Each of them. And what I noticed there, during the meetings with the doctors of the Staten Island University Hospital… in their eyes… I noticed that the people who work there, in the hospital, and return our guys to a normal life, – Americans, – they are also proud of Ukrainian warriors. Never before have Americans been so proud of the power and strength of Ukrainians. Thank you so much! It’s a big privilege to be here. Thank you! Dear friends! Dear Americans! Among the documents I saw here today at the National Archives of the United States, was a telegram from Abraham Lincoln to General Grant. An inspiring document… Absolutely. “Hold on with a bulldog grip, and chew and choke as much as possible,” – President Lincoln&#x27;s words reflect the courage and faith that helped America. Such words reflect exactly how Ukrainians fight. In our victorious battles for Ukraine and Kharkiv and the Snake Island in the Black Sea. In our battle for Bakhmut, where our soldiers are pressing forward – no matter the challenges. In our battle for every inch of Ukrainian land. Every day of this war, Ukrainian soldiers hold-on with the grip of a bulldog. They chew and choke the Russian occupiers as much as possible. Never before has the Russian dictatorship met such strong resistance. And never again will Russia manage to destroy any other nation. Putin&#x27;s list was long. Just recently. After Ukraine, if we fall, half of Europe would again be in danger of being in Moscow’s sphere of influence. But American investment in Ukrainian security and global protection of freedom is working. One hundred percent. Every cent. Now Putin’s list of goals is different – instead of dictating terms to America, Europe and the whole free world, Putin is forced to humiliate himself by personally entertaining a delegation from Pyongyang and trying to find favor with Tehran. This is his clear weakness. Yes, it’s true. Ukraine pays the highest price for defending freedom and global security. Every day and night our soldiers sacrifice their lives holding their ground in the trenches on the front line. They lose their comrades in battle. They lose limbs tripping Russian mines. Every day and night, Russia continues its terror with missiles and Iranian drones. But every day and every night, our unity stays strong. You support us. And we know we shall not fall. And we see how our freedom keeps the snatch of a bulldog. And we are confident that other nations will not have to throw their armies into this battle, because Ukraine is capable of ending this war with a victory that will become our common victory. It is not the evil empire, but the lack of unity that can bring freedom to its knees. We will do everything to ensure that our unity – the unity of Ukraine, the United States and the entire free world – becomes stronger than ever before. And that all people, women and men, adults and children, every family... People&#x27;s desire to live and not the artillery or missiles, would determine life on Earth. First Lady: Over the past year and a half, we’ve all experienced many important things. And we did many things for the first time. I personally made my first official visit to the U.S. a year ago and spoke in the Congress. At that time, my husband could not leave Ukraine for a foreign visit – while the fate of Ukraine was yet to be decided. Never before has the First Lady from another country addressed the Congress. And never before had asked for weapons to defend her country. But, even if we do something for the first time, something extraordinary, and it is for the sake of salvation – it delivers the response. I saw the tears of senators and congressmen. This proved better than words – we value life equally. It is equally important for us that life wins. The stories of Ukrainian children killed by Russian missiles, which I told Congress about, are not out there somewhere. They are here. Perhaps never before has the world felt so strongly that global means small. That the trouble of some is the trouble of all, that violation of rights in one end of the world is violation of the rights of all. I returned home with your support, with weapons – such as anti-aircraft defense that gives protection to our people – adults and children… Such was our path to the “Patriots” in Ukraine. And thousands of lives have now been saved. This is so important – when the Congress hears, when America hears! I came back with the feeling that we understand each other. President: Today, there are different people here – doctors and soldiers, politicians and businessmen, adults and children… Ukrainians, Americans. There is not a single soul here today who would not care what happens to freedom. And there is not a soul in Ukraine that does not feel gratitude to you, America. To you – the people who help us not because you have to, but because your heart cannot let you do otherwise. Thank you. That is humanity. This is what makes us Ukraine. That&#x27;s what makes you America. Today, we’re here together with Olena to express gratitude to all of you, to the Americans – ordinary people who have done and are doing extraordinary things at the call of their hearts. American hearts beat just like the hearts of Ukrainian people. And all the most important historical achievements of nations are a reflection of whether people are capable of being extraordinary for the sake of life, for the sake of freedom. Never before in human history has this been more vital than it is now. I want you all to know that America has saved millions of Ukrainian lives. Millions! Men and women, children and adults, in cities and in villages… Millions of Ukrainian children can now be with their mothers… Men on the frontline now hear their children waiting for them in cities and villages deep in the rear. It is possible because most of Ukraine is free. And we must free all of our land, our people. And I thank every American, everyone in the world who is helping, for every life saved in Ukraine. Today here is Ivan. Hi, Ivan. Please, come. We see you. A Ukrainian boy, he is only 17 years old. He lost his leg when a Russian tank crushed the car his family was traveling in. His stepfather died then, his mother was wounded. Now Ivan not only walks and runs, he surfs and knows that he has a chance for a full life. Today here is a Ukrainian girl Sasha, she is 10 years old. Her family tried to leave Bucha at the beginning of the Russian invasion. Russian soldiers fired at the car – Sasha received a serious injury to her hand. There was a long time of treatment and rehabilitation. According to the “Unbreakable” program – just like Ivan – now Sasha also has a full life ahead, I am grateful for that. Grateful for thousands of such children and adults who were helped by American doctors! We want to thank all the doctors! President: Here is Peter Harsh, a doctor. Where is Peter? Thank you. Who helped Ivan and many other boys and girls, men and women. Here is Yakov Granidar, a doctor. Please, Yakov, come to us. A co-founder of a foundation that gave a chance for a full life to more than a hundred Ukrainians. Here is Genadii Fuizailov, professor of Harvard Medical School, doctor, founder of the foundation that provided treatment for children with extremely serious burns. Here is doctor Robert Montgomery. He himself lives with a donor heart, and at the same time he travels to war-torn Ukraine and helps people’s hearts to beat – he operates himself. Here is Michael Corcoran, a doctor, the founder of medical clinics. He has been helping the military for a long time. Here is Oksana Jackson, a pediatric plastic surgeon. Since 2013, she has been coming to Ukraine to operate on children. After the start of the war, her patients became soldiers who needed facial operations. Here is Walter Ulrich, chief of a charitable organization that supplies medical equipment to Ukraine. More than 175 tons of such equipment are already saving lives. Thank you so much. Here is Vitaliy Dubil, who helps hospitals in Ukraine, in particular, the largest children&#x27;s hospital located in Kyiv, as well as military doctors of our country. Here is Alla Lopatkina, the president of the foundation that sends ambulances and fire trucks to Ukraine, dozens and dozens are already in Ukraine. Here is Yuriy Deichakivskyi, cardiologist, volunteer, man who helps… If America did not have such people, there would be no freedom left in the world but for such great hearts. First Lady: We said that this defense conducted by Ukraine is a protection of values. Such as a right to life and personality. These are not only physical things, but also intangible values. The defenders of Ukraine are very different people – of different views, beliefs, or not religious at all. But they all clearly feel that they are fighting against evil. Against the worst that might be borne within a human – a conscious effort to kill, destroy, grab, enslave. Therefore, it is also a spiritual battle. Sincere gratitude to everyone who fights together with us in spiritual dimension and dimension of values. I have the honor of knowing Archbishop Borys Hudziak personally. And he is known to thousands of Ukrainians – soldiers, displaced persons, and many others whom he helps. And young people who, thanks to him, get a great education. And also here is the rector of the Church of St. Andrew and chaplain of the US Air Force Volodymyr Shtelyak and our honorary consul in the city of Seattle and pastor Valery Holoborodko… Leaders of their communities who help others. First Lady: I would like to invite to join us Mr. Peter Gelb, the general director of the “Met” – the legendary New York Opera, – which has become one of the largest centers of support for our fight with the language of art. Peter&#x27;s tremendous work has helped us to achieve the cultural solidarity we need – a culture that fosters freedom, that gives strength to stand in the struggle. President: Thank you so much. Here today are the leaders of the Ukrainian community in America, activists, volunteers, benefactors. Michael Sawkiw, Andriy Futey, Yaroslav Dzwinyk, Iryna Mazur, Lilia Popovych, Jonathan Freedman, Maryna Bayduk, Dora Chomyak, Nadia Shaporynska, Iryna Vaschuk, Cristopher Michael Manson. Those who work tirelessly 24/7 to help and bring the time of our victory closer. Thank you so much. President: I remember how the journey of confidence that we are on now began. When I spoke with President Biden early in the morning on February 24, 2022, the first day of the Russian invasion, the world did not really believe in Ukraine. The endless columns of Russian tanks and vehicles that invaded our territory seemed invincible to many in the world. But I assured President Biden then, that we – in Ukraine – will not give up. And he assured me that America will be with us as long as it takes. The United States Congress supports us. The President supports us. People support us. Ukraine will always be grateful for this. Never before has there been such a powerful unity between Ukraine and America. But what could be more convincing than when even America’s children are eager to help defend freedom? Ryan, Mr. Hirschhorn, please join us! Ryan is a strong man, he is 13 years old. Together with his father he launched a very inspiring project – using hearts. It is a blue and yellow sculpture that reminds other people, other communities and nations what freedom is all about. This project fundraised big donations to buy medical equipment for Ukrainians. Ryan could just spend time with a PlayStation – he’s a real man, but he’s a teenager. But Ryan has a strong, great heart, golden heart, such hearts take freedom seriously, they don’t just play with it. Thank you, Ryan! Thank you, our friend! President: It is a great privilege to honor all of you with state awards of Ukraine! On February 24th, we in Ukraine could not have known that we would be supported by so many people and such kind of people! But now we see it could not be otherwise. Ukrainians, Americans – we do not betray ourselves, we do not betray freedom. Let our open hearts win! And now I ask everyone to applaud every great heart! President: Thank you America! God bless America! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>This Russian aggression must end with our victory - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the solemn session of the Parliament of Canada</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Canada! Before I start I just want to remind one thing. This thing is very important to understand both Ukraine and Canada. And what we are up to, what we need to do. To do together. 1983. The City of Edmonton. Its history is closely linked to the destiny of Ukraine and Ukrainian Canadian community. That year in Edmonton the first monument to the victims of Holodomor was built in the world. Thank you so much! Was built to remember the genocide against the Ukrainian people. The genocide ordered and perpetrated by Moscow. The first ever Holodomor monument in the world. At that time Ukraine did not yet have memorials commemorating the victims of genocide of Ukrainians. Because Ukraine was under Moscow&#x27;s control back then. This fall will mark the 40th anniversary since that first and very important commemoration of the victims of Holodomor. A lot has changed since then. Ukraine gained independence. Ukraine is restoring its own historic memory. Dozens of other countries – their parliaments, their governments have already recognised Holodomor as a genocide of the Ukrainian people. This year alone there have been 11 of such recognitions. And I am sure that the world – the whole world – will recognise the truth about Holodomor. But there is something that has not changed either in 40 years since the monument in Edmonton was built or in 90 years since the Holodomor. Moscow now as always is bent on controlling Ukraine and makes use of all available means to do that including genocide. It is genocide – what Russian occupiers are doing to Ukraine. And when we want to win, when we call-on the world to support us, it is not just about an ordinary conflict. It is about saving lives of millions of people. Literally physical salvation. Ordinary women and men, children… Our families. Whole communities. Entire cities… Russia’s destruction of Mariupol or Volnovakha or Bakhmut or any other city or village in Ukraine must not go unpunished. Life and justice must prevail – everywhere in Ukraine, for all Ukrainians. This Russian aggression must end with our victory, so that Russia will never bring back genocide to Ukraine and will never even try to do so. Moscow must lose – once and for all. And it will lose! Dear speakers! The whole Parliament of Canada! Dear Justin, Mr. Prime Minister! Ladies and gentlemen of the government! Dear representatives of all the communities and cities! All citizens of Canada! In my opinion, one of the most sterling qualities of your country is that justice is not an empty word for Canada. Another extremely important fact about you is that you never, ever make a political bet on hatred and enmity. You are always on the bright side of history. During the First World War, and in the time between those terrible wars, and during the Second World War, and during the Cold War, you always defended freedom. You have always defended justice. I had no doubt that you would choose the side of freedom and justice when Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. Thank you. But it is never enough only to choose the right side. You also need to be able to be a leader on this side. And you do. You are a leader. I thank you for that, Canada! Thank you for your political support for Ukraine. This is truly support of a leader. And it is global in scale. Because when you are fighting for something, when you are fighting for good in human nature, the false neutrality looks obviously immoral. When one sees true leaders, all others who are afraid to be real, to speak out, to fight – have only two options. To change or to be looked down. I thank you, Canada, for being a real example of leadership and honesty for so many around the world – an example that inspires others to defend life. Canada&#x27;s support for Ukraine with weapons and equipment has allowed us to save thousands of lives. This includes air defense systems, armored vehicles, artillery shells, and very significant assistance in demining. Thank you! Canada&#x27;s leadership in sanctions against Russia for this war and terror really encourages others in the world to follow your lead. I am especially grateful for your extremely strong, 100 percent leadership support of the Ukrainian movement to NATO. For your strong participation in training our soldiers. It is very important. It is already a tradition – that Canada trains those who defend the world. Thousands and thousands of pilots during the Second World War. Thousands and thousands of Ukrainians now. This is what makes victory strong and indispensable – training. Thank you for this! Thank you for your economic support. For helping Ukraine to get rid of its dependence on Russian nuclear fuel. This is progress not only for us. Ukraine and Canada, together with their partners and friends, are demonstrating to everyone that it is quite realistic to completely cut-off our ties with dubious Russian nuclear technologies. In addition to the purely technological danger, the Russian nuclear industry also serves Moscow&#x27;s political expansion. Russia uses nuclear technology, and the construction of nuclear power plants, like gas and oil, for political attacks against the sovereignty of other nations. Russia is trying to break the sovereignty of others through its manipulation of energy resources… all energy resources. So, the more nations are free from Russian energy resources, the sooner energy in the world will once again become just an energy resource, not a weapon against sovereignties. Another important area of our cooperation. Literally justice. Today, in talks with Justin, with Mr. Prime Minister, we discussed the Canadian initiative for the G7 to step-up efforts to confiscate Russian assets. Those funds that Russia and its henchmen use to pay for the war should be used to fairly compensate for the damage caused by war and terror. Active and global work is also required to bring Russia to justice for the crime of aggression itself and for absolutely all crimes from this aggression – all deaths, every deportation of every child and adult. Every life needs to be protected. Every attacked nation needs justice to rule. The world needs it too. So that other potential aggressors can see that war ends in verdicts for the aggressor. I urge you, Canada, to extend your ability to lead to other countries, especially in this matter – of justice, of prosecuting the aggression, of compensation for aggression, of making the aggressor feel how strong justice is. And most of all, I would like to thank you, Canada, for the purely human thing – for making Ukrainians feel at home when they are here, in Canada. Thank you. This is not just a legacy of history. This is a legacy of character. The Ukrainian Canadian community is about millions of Ukrainian destinies that have become the destiny of Canada with all its diversity of communities. Freedom-loving. Courage. Our special inner call for justice. The ability of our people to share comfort wherever they go, to build and create not to ruin or humiliate. Ukrainian flags in Canada are a part of everyday life as absolute trust to Canada in Ukraine. In fact, such proximity provides many answers, including answers to questions about this war. Can we give up? No. Can we betray the good in human nature? No. Can we agree to evil? No. Can we allow our identity to be erased? No. Ukraine and Canada are the same – we stand and we fight for life. Ukraine, not genocide, will be victorious in this war. People will be the winners, not the Kremlin. Freedom will be the winner. Justice will be the winner. You can know this for sure about us, because you know for sure about yourself that you would never submit to evil. Je te remercie, Canada! And may one day soon a monument be built in Edmonton as in other cities of the world and in the cities of Ukraine to honor the victory of our people in this war. Our common victory with you. With you – the people of Canada, with all your communities, with all your legacy, the legacy of good. Ladies and gentlemen! Today me and my beautiful First Lady had the honor of meeting with Governor General of Canada Honourable Mary Simon. She taught me a word from her mother tongue – “ajuinnata”. She said the meaning of this word is – don’t give-up, stay strong against all odds. And so shall it be. Ajuinnata Canada! Ajuinnata Ukraine! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a meeting with representatives of the Canadian community</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-23</span></div>
  <p>Слава Україні! I am so proud to hear it in Canada. These words unite the whole Canada, all the people, all communities and cities. Cлава Україні! This is how unity sounds. I am proud that we achieved unity like this. It is so inspiring! And it is not just inspiring, it helps others. It helps us all to become stronger and our freedom to get stronger and it moves our unity to victory. Ukraine’s victory! Canada’s victory! People’s victory! To our common victory! The victory will be ours – I have no doubt. And I hear — you have no doubt. I am happy to be here with my wife, First Lady. Three days together. The first time from the beginning of the full-scale war. Thank you, Justin. To be serious, I am so proud that Ukraine inspires, that Ukrainians inspire and so do Canadian Ukrainians. I thank you – all of you – that you are active. You let others feel Ukraine’s vibe, the vibe of “Слава Україні” – the vibe of people who never surrender. You preserved Ukrainian culture, the Ukrainian dream of what we have, of independence, when Ukraine has not yet gained its independence. And I thank your grandfathers and grandmothers who saved Ukrainian identity, who contributed to making Canada a great country. And you help to protect Ukraine now, it is very important - when we are defending and will definitely preserve our independence! You help volunteers! You have sheltered our people... Canada trains our guys, our soldiers, our warriors. Canada gives weapons to Ukraine to move forward, to push back Russia. And I thank you for this – thank you all! And I am sure Canada will never lose Ukrainian vibe. And the day will come when we gather at a similar place in Ukraine. Many people, millions, cheering crowd, blue and yellow flags. And maple leaf flags. And the whole Ukraine will say thank you! Thank you! Thank you, Canada! Слава Україні</p>

  <h2>It was a very productive week, we have a lot of good defense and other decisions – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-24</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! It was a productive week. Very productive. We have many good defense and other decisions. Defense packages. From the United States – including artillery, necessary shells, HIMARS munitions, air defense missiles, additional air defense systems, tactical vehicles. And some other types of weapons that will prove themselves on the battlefield. From Canada, we have a decision on long-term defense support worth half a billion U.S. dollars. In particular, these are medevac vehicles, which are very much needed at the front. We have agreed on their production and supply. There is a historic decision by the United States to jointly produce weapons and defense systems. In particular, air defense. This is something that was an absolute fantasy until recently. But it will become a reality. We will make it a reality. Everyone who works for the state. And this is the new quality of Ukraine&#x27;s defense industry – much more powerful. And this is also the economy. Protection for our cities. Enterprises, new jobs for both our peoples – for Ukrainians and Americans. We have a clear perspective of a new resilience of Ukraine that will prevent the recurrence of Russian aggression – this is what we have already agreed on. I am grateful to President Biden, his entire team, and everyone in America who values freedom and supports Ukraine. I held very important meetings in Washington, in Congress – both parties, both houses. There were a lot of questions, a lot of dialog. Equally sincere answers, absolute frankness and sincere understanding. And we specifically requested a format of meetings and communication in Congress that would allow for the most detailed conversation. This resulted in more trust, and I heard that support for Ukraine will persist. In general, many morally robust and important positions were voiced at different levels in the United States – from the top level to all those involved in negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation. The same is true for Canada. There is a clear unity. There are new sanctions against Russia, and there will be even more sanctions pressure. We have reached economic agreements with both governments and businesses. There is a decision on a free trade area with Canada. A memorandum on energy cooperation was signed in Washington. An agreement was reached in Ottawa to rebuild Kakhovka HPP and reconstruct Kaniv HPP. There is an obvious interest of large companies in the U.S. and Canada to work in Ukraine. At the level of the Ministry of Strategic Industries, there is mutual understanding with defense companies. And there is a very important mutual understanding at the level of societies – at the level of ordinary people who really care about Ukraine and really wish us victory and all Ukrainians protection from Russian terror. When ordinary people in America say they pray for Ukraine, it is truly touching and makes our relations stronger. Separately, I would like to thank the Government of Canada for its readiness to allocate funding for the Holodomor Genocide Museum, for the completion of this museum. It is symbolic that Canada will be the one to support Ukraine in preserving its historical memory. Thank you, Canada! We have agreements of the First Lady of Ukraine regarding support for the rehabilitation of veterans, there is a corresponding Ukrainian-Canadian medical partnership. Olena is expanding access of Ukrainian culture to the world&#x27;s leading museums, and now there is an agreement with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Olena also had important meetings and speeches on the sidelines of the UN, in particular, regarding the protection of Ukrainian children during the war. This year, Ukraine presented to the UN a vision of reforming the key UN institution – the Security Council. The Security Council is currently not able at all to stop aggression and actually restore peace because of the obsolete veto system, when there is no restriction on the aggressor&#x27;s abuse of the veto. This needs to be changed, and in general, all nations that respect other nations and peace should be given more rights and opportunities in the UN. I am sure the world supports this Ukrainian position. And of course, this week was also fruitful in terms of bilateral meetings with the leaders of other countries. Thank you all for your support! And for your willingness to work with Ukraine. Yes, this is a different scope of cooperation. Different areas. But this is a clear recognition that Ukraine has a future. Its own future. Powerful and free. And our warriors. I am extremely grateful. I am proud of you! This week, there are grounds to praise the brigades fighting both in the east and in the south. 5th separate assault brigade and 80th separate airborne assault brigade. Thank you for your fortitude in the battles near Klishchiivka! 93rd separate mechanized brigade. Guys, thank you! 15th operational brigade of the National Guard and 71st separate hunting brigade – thank you for the true Ukrainian power in the battles near Verbove... 116th separate mechanized brigade – well done, guys! Thank you to everyone who is fighting for Ukraine, who is on combat posts, in combat missions! Thank you to everyone who helps! Every week brings Ukraine more strength and opportunities. Hence, every week brings our victory closer. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The best thing for us is to be capable of producing advanced weapons to guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s security, and we will do so - address by the President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-25</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today Defense Minister Umerov delivered an important report: the first American-made Abrams tanks are already in Ukraine. We are preparing them to reinforce our actions against the occupiers. And it will be a significant reinforcement. We are also working to get all the other weapons capabilities we need. This includes F16s - we are preparing pilots and infrastructure. This also includes long-range weapons - we are doing our utmost to enable Ukraine to do more to liberate its territory. The same goes for air defense. To cover the entire territory of our country, we need more systems than we currently have. The best thing for us is to be able to produce air defense and other advanced weapons. This is the only way. To guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s security. And we will produce, we will build all the necessary production facilities step by step. And, by the way, we see a very clear interest of the world in working with us to build a new defense force not only for Ukraine, but also for our partners. For our world as a whole - a rules-based world that will not tolerate the aggression and terror that Russia is trying to make the norm. Today, Minister for Strategic Industries Kamyshin reported on the preparation of the first Defense Industries Forum: there are already more than 160 companies that will participate. 26 countries. Different parts of the world: America, Asia, Europe, Australia. Manufacturers of a full range of weapons. We will bend every effort to unite the world to create a new and powerful arsenal for Ukraine and all defenders of international law. Today, I also held meetings on the results of my visit to the United States and Canada, as well as meetings with the leaders of partner countries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. All the agreements we have reached, all the prospects for Ukraine - everything must be implemented as soon as possible. For each of the areas, we are appointing a specific official who will be responsible for the implementation of the agreements. Defense, political cooperation, strengthening and purging of institutions, energy sector, recovery. I would like to pay special attention to Penny Pritzker, the newly appointed U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine&#x27;s Recovery. This is a very important appointment. It is a clear symbol of America&#x27;s confidence in Ukraine&#x27;s future. I had a meeting with Mrs. Pritzker in New York, and she was also in Washington for expanded talks with President Biden. The atmosphere is productive. And it is important for us to ensure that the Special Representative can start working with Ukraine and in Ukraine as soon as possible. I also held a meeting with government officials and the Office on our grain exports. We coordinated further steps and noted the results achieved. First: The European Commission endorsed the roadmap for mutual monitoring of grain exports. This is completely rational. Second, we are gradually removing emotions from this topic on most issues. Work with our neighbors can and should become fully constructive, and Ukraine is doing everything for this. Third, I am grateful to those of our partners who have prevented violations of EU trade rules and the Association Agreement. We expect the same constructive cooperation as with Bulgaria and Romania from other neighboring countries. The European Union is a space for mutual understanding and cooperation. This is how it should be. And one more thing. I would like to thank all our Air Force servicemen, all our anti-aircraft gunners, and servicemen of mobile fire groups who repel Russian missile and drone attacks every day and night. During just one attack against Ukraine last night, the enemy used 33 strike weapons - &quot;Shaheds&quot; and missiles. Most of them were launched against Odesa and the region. Most of them were shot down. Unfortunately, not all of them. Unfortunately, there were hits. But 30 targets out of 33 were neutralized. It is important to bear in mind that each neutralized target means saved lives. And we will retaliate against Russia for every strike against our cities and villages, against every Ukrainian community. For Odesa, for Beryslav and Kherson, for Donetsk, Kharkiv and Sumy regions. For all our regions. I thank everyone who rescues people after the occupiers&#x27; attacks! I thank everyone in the world who helps us defend Ukraine! Glory to our warriors! Glory to all who work for the sake of the state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>There will be more Ukrainian actions against the terrorist state — address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-26</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A report on the day. I held a meeting of the Staff. Several key points. The first is the actual situation at the front, our offensive and defensive operations. Important reports on the east and south. On the destruction of logistics and headquarters of the occupiers. There are good details. Loud details. I thank all the Ukrainian warriors who distinguished themselves! The second issue is the supply of shells. This is a topic we are dealing with on a daily basis. Supplies from partners. Searching for new opportunities in the world — we know exactly how to secure supplies. And we are gradually increasing the volume of Ukrainian production. This is one of our top priorities. Today, by the way, in addition to the reports at the meeting of the Staff, there was a separate meeting with the Ministry of Strategic Industries. There was also a separate informative intelligence report on the situation in the Russian military-industrial complex. We clearly see the areas where pressure on Russia needs to be increased so that terrorist capabilities do not grow. Sanctions are not enough. There will be more. There will be more of our own, Ukrainian actions against the terrorist state. As long as Russia&#x27;s aggression continues, Russia&#x27;s losses must be tangible. And, of course, our work with partners to end the war on Ukrainian terms, based on our Peace Formula. A totally fair one. Today I met with the President of the National Council of Austria, who was on a visit to Ukraine. We discussed in detail our efforts to get the world majority to join the implementation of the Peace Formula. And I appreciate Austria&#x27;s willingness to join in. Of course, we also discussed our European course. I spoke about Ukraine&#x27;s implementation of seven recommendations of the European Commission. And we rely on Austria&#x27;s continued support for Ukraine&#x27;s European integration. One more thing. Every day, Russian terrorists hit our cities and villages with missiles and &quot;Shaheds&quot;. Almost every night, dozens of drones and various types of missiles are destroyed in the Ukrainian sky. Unfortunately, there are hits. There is also falling debris... And our rescuers, our police, doctors, volunteers, utilities — all emergency services — are always working 24/7 to help people and save our infrastructure. Today I want to thank these people who have distinguished themselves over the past weeks. In Odesa region, Poltava region, Cherkasy region. Employees of the State Emergency Service of Odesa region: Chief Master Sergeant Oleksiy Zhaboriuk, Sergeant Serhiy Chobu, Sergeant Oleksandr Vieliev. Odesa police officers: Colonel Vyacheslav Barba and Major Mykola Perekrestov. Firefighters of the Odesa branch of the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority: senior firefighter Hennadiy Maystrenko and firefighter Andriy Kohut. Thank you all, guys, for your work! State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Poltava region: Sergeants Yevhen Bilokobylskyi and Volodymyr Smyk, Captain Serhiy Kyrychenko — thank you!

  <h2>Our warriors need more means of Russian missiles, combat drones and aircraft destruction –  address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-27</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! A brief report on this day – it was a long and busy one, with many meetings and various events... Morning conference call – reports from the military, the Security Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In particular, on the Russian shelling and dealing with the aftermath. Special attention is paid to Kherson and Kherson region. These days, Russia has been shelling Kherson, Beryslav, and villages in Kherson region with particular brutality. Artillery, guided bombs. Targeting houses, farms, ordinary shops and infrastructure. It is a deliberate terror of the occupier. My condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones! And I express my gratitude to each and every person who works in this region – in Kherson – and in all our other regions that are experiencing similar strikes. Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, northern regions. It is extremely important that despite everything there are rescuers and salvation. When they are there, when lives are saved, terror will not prevail. I thank all the doctors and employees of the State Emergency Service, all the volunteers, police, utility workers, power engineers, local authorities and everyone who helps. I thank you for saving the lives of our people and for restoring their living conditions! There are special orders for the military, there will also be special orders for everyone involved in international affairs: our warriors need more means of destroying Russian missiles, &quot;Shaheds&quot; and other combat drones, as well as Russian aircraft. And I am grateful to everyone in the world who is already helping and is willing to ramp up assistance to our country with the means that can provide more protection against Russian terror. Today, I received letters of credence from the ambassadors – seven ambassadors who are starting their mission in Ukraine. The UK, France, Estonia, Canada, Hungary, Slovenia and the European Union. I talked to all of them. They are determined to work with Ukraine as productively as possible, and I am sure that this is the kind of work that all of us need now. Everyone in the world, who wants to bring the war to an end. To bring our mutual victory closer. From now on, we have a new ambassador for our United24 fundraising platform. It is the British actor Mark Strong. We spoke today, and I thanked Mark for his decision to work in the Education and Science direction. His goal will be to raise funds to rebuild Ukrainian schools. Our task is to give all Ukrainian children the opportunity to study at school, not remotely, where and when security conditions allow. By the way, United24 has already raised more than $470 million. Almost half a billion in donations from more than 110 countries. Different countries, different levels of contributions. People are helping – ordinary people and companies. I am grateful to everyone! And one more thing. I held several preparatory meetings today. This month we are planning powerful measures to reinforce the state, and we are already working on the agenda of October and November. Ukraine will be stronger. Ukraine will have more capabilities to defend itself. No matter what happens in the world, no matter what the external conditions are, we must remember that it is only our conditions, our internal attitude to Ukraine, to freedom, to our goals, that will determine when we will achieve our goal. The main goal – Ukraine&#x27;s victory. For Ukraine, strength has no alternatives. And everyone who strengthens the state, everyone who becomes stronger, everyone who helps fight the enemy and achieve results for Ukraine – all of them bring our goal closer. Glory to our warriors! Glory to our unbreakable people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will do everything to ensure the safety of Ukraine and the entire Europe from Russian nuclear blackmail – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-28</span></div>
  <p>I wish good health to all Ukrainian men and women! Significant international day today. Meetings and negotiations with partners. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg was in Kyiv – fruitful negotiations. Not only about our defense now, but also about our strategic defense, the joint defense of everyone in Europe. Ukraine deserves to become a member of NATO, and it will. Absolutely. And this is not just our Ukrainian ambition. It is the only effective security perspective for Europe guaranteeing real lasting peace. We are working to make practical progress on the issue of NATO membership. Today, we also discussed the work of our Ukraine-NATO Council format. What we can do using this format. It was a good meeting. I also held talks with the Minister of Defense of France. Today. And the day before – with the Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom. Key partners. Very significant cooperation we already have, and even more significant cooperation we can achieve. We discussed, in particular, strengthening our forces, and the overall strategy for our victory in the war. We are also working towards joint production of the weapons we need, which is essential for both Ukraine and our partners. I thank France, I thank the United Kingdom and all our partners – every leader, every country that stands with us against Russian terror and brings the much-needed peace closer. There are also results on the IAEA platform – Ukraine has become a member of the Board of Governors of this organization. The International Atomic Energy Agency. And this not only underscores our international security role but also provides real opportunities for Ukraine to influence the adoption of decisions that are binding for all IAEA members and the entire international community. We will do everything to implement the first point of our Peace Formula – nuclear and radiation security. And to ensure the complete liberation of our Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the Russian occupiers and to secure Ukraine and all of Europe from Russian radiation blackmail. We are also preparing for the coming weeks to yield more results for our international efforts, for the strengthening of Ukraine. Today, I held several relevant meetings, including an important meeting with intelligence chiefs. The results will come. Regarding the frontlines. Kupiansk direction, Lyman, Bakhmut, Mariinka, Avdiivka, Shakhtarsk, our southern directions. I thank all of you for your strength! I thank each and every one of you who are currently in battle, at combat positions, on combat missions! We are working to provide you with more weapons, more powerful and effective weapons! Our Ukrainian weapons. And it will happen. Glory to you, warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Not only thanks to the strength of our weapons but also thanks to the strength of our spirit and humanity, evil will never prevail in Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, A brief report on this day. An emotional day. I began it with events at Babyn Yar. The 82nd anniversary of the mass shootings of Jews by the Nazis in Babyn Yar. In just a few days in September 1941, over 30,000 people were killed. In total, during the Nazi occupation, about 100,000 people were killed in Babyn Yar. Jews, as well as Roma and Ukrainians. Representatives of other nations. Very important to preserve the memory of these victims and of the fact that the evil the Holocaust perpetrated was defeated and punished. Ukraine preserves such a memory. &quot;Never again!&quot; For us, for Ukraine, for the entire civilized world, these are not empty words. And it will always be so. It is very symbolic that today I met with our Ukrainian teachers – those on whom, in fact, the preservation of historical memory and much of humanity depends. This Sunday, Ukraine will celebrate Teacher&#x27;s Day – the educators&#x27; day. Today, I thanked all Ukrainian teachers, educators, instructors, and mentors. All those who undertake one of the most honorable missions in life – educating children in what is necessary to navigate their destiny and be resilient on their life journey. But education is always more than acquiring knowledge and skills and mastering a profession. It&#x27;s about character and its strength. It&#x27;s about the clarity of distinguishing between good and evil, which comes when you study human culture. Education prepares and calibrates a person&#x27;s moral compass so that it works, and through this, a person&#x27;s work and life enrich humanity. This is very important. And we see, particularly in what Russia is doing, what happens when the education system has collapsed. When the moral compass of people and society is broken. Evil prevails in such a country. This will never happen in Ukraine. Not only thanks to the strength of our weapons but also thanks to the strength of our spirit, the strength of Ukrainian characters, our humanity, which will undoubtedly prevail. This week significantly strengthened our country and our people. There will be important news for Ukraine tomorrow – for our warriors, for our entire state. We are working to ensure that the coming weeks will add strength to Ukraine – internal strength – and the necessary cooperation with the world. So that the world hears us, understands us, and supports us. I thank everyone who is helping! Glory to everyone who fights and works for the sake of Ukraine and its people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine on the Day of Education Workers</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear teachers, mentors, esteemed educators! We are meeting now on the eve of your holiday - Teacher&#x27;s Day, the Day of Ukrainian Education Workers. Every year, this day is bright and, despite everything, festive for us, because it always contains one hundred percent gratitude, respect and understanding of how much depends on you. On everyone who teaches our children to walk through life, teaches them to see their own in life, and who gives them the knowledge they simply cannot do without. But this year&#x27;s Educators&#x27; Day is very special. It coincides with a very important day - the Day of Defenders of Ukraine, the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos. And this makes a lot of sense. And not only now, in this time of war. A tutor, teacher, lecturer, mentor – at any period of life, when they teach us, we take on more than just knowledge and skills. We take on character, integrity, values. And it is so important when a teacher has them. It is so important when a teacher gives a child not only an education, but also the necessary patience. When a teacher shows the necessary wisdom. It happens that a few wise words from a teacher determine the direction of a person in life, give confidence and faith - faith in oneself. It is so important when a teacher gives a child the ability to see and respect talent. To hear oneself, but also to hear others, which is so important. To know what is best for you, but also to be able to take care of others, to respect people, to respect humanity. To respect Ukraine. To value freedom. To value it indeed. And not just as one&#x27;s own will, not just as something you can do, but also as the will of your people, your society, each and every one, your community. Many of us were really lucky to have such teachers. Ukraine is fortunate to have such educators - such teachers and tutors, such lecturers and mentors. We all see what you can do when we see what Ukraine can do - our people, our defenders. A soldier&#x27;s integrity is almost always a continuation of the integrity of your family and your teacher. Any capabilities of a state are always a reflection of the knowledge and talents of its people, and the ability of people to realize this talent. What people defend – light or darkness, decency or evil, life or slavery – is all what they learned. All what they were taught. Sometimes remotely, sometimes directly, but it always has to be sincere, otherwise it just won&#x27;t work. And I want to thank you, each and every one of you here, and all Ukrainian teachers, every employee of our education system. I thank you for teaching our children to be humane, to be educated, to be brave, in peace and in times of air raids, no matter what, under any circumstances. This means being Ukrainian! I want to thank you for that! Thank you very much! Congratulations on your day! And I ask all our children, all schoolchildren and students to appreciate you – their teachers. Appreciate the power and knowledge of teachers that they turn into your power and knowledge. It is an extremely honorable mission to be a teacher. Congratulations to you! Glory to you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are laying the foundation for the arsenal of the free world – speech by the President of Ukraine at the First International Defense Industries Forum</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-30</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and gentlemen, For me, it is an honor to open in Ukraine, in our capital, in free Kyiv, the First International Defense Industries Forum. Right now, over 30 countries from around the world are represented here. Europe, America, Asia, Australia. 252 defense companies that manufacture a full range of weapons and defense systems and solutions. But most importantly, in this hall, there is confidence. Confidence of the free world. Confidence that we can protect our people, our values, and our freedom. And we will do it. For sure. Because we will build the necessary arsenal. And I am pleased to welcome all of you to the Forum. All of you who are ready to build the arsenal of the free world together with Ukraine and in Ukraine. A modern and powerful arsenal that will leave no chance for any aggressor. This is not just about Russia&#x27;s aggression. Yes, our primary task is to win in this war and bring back long-lasting and, most importantly, reliable peace to our people. We will accomplish this task. Thanks to our cooperation with you, with the majority of the world. Thanks to broad coalitions supporting our defense. Thanks to the production of weapons and ammunition in Ukraine. And thanks to the fact that we implement technology in Ukraine&#x27;s defense and use the most effective battle practices, real practices of pushing forward, effective practices of protecting people and infrastructure from Russian terror. But everything we have learned ourselves, we are ready to teach and share practices with our partners. Everything that serves our defense can serve - and very successfully - the defense of our partners. This is how we are laying the foundation for the arsenal of the free world. With its criminal and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, Russia has shown every nation that it can threaten the sovereignty and normal life of any people on the planet. And looking at our defense in this war, at our movement towards liberating our own territory, every state understands what it needs for its own defense. What kind of weapons, what industries, what modern technologies, what alliances. By how we have endured in the war and by how Ukraine will prevail, we provide a successful strategy for national and collective defense to all others in the world who value peace. A long-term strategy. Right now, for the next decades, the most powerful defense-industrial complexes are being determined, what their priorities will be, and what the standard of defense in the world will be. It is being determined precisely in Ukraine. Ladies and gentlemen! Ukraine is at a point in the defense marathon where it is absolutely essential to move forward without any retreat. A frontline result is needed every day. I am grateful to everyone around the world who helps us achieve such results. But it&#x27;s evident that without our own production of weapons and ammunition, without our own defense technologies, this would simply be impossible. I take pride in the fact that at this Forum today, we have not only representatives of cutting-edge foreign companies but also representatives of our domestic Ukrainian enterprises. Enterprises that are growing stronger during this time of war. State-owned and private enterprises. Established defense companies with a long history and entirely new defense companies, defense startups that have just begun but are already making a name for themselves. The world sees what Ukrainian missiles, technologies, and drones are capable of. We are creating the world&#x27;s first fleet of naval drones that render Russian military ships ineffective and force them into hiding. We have initiated the production of cannons and &quot;NATO caliber&quot; ammunition that are needed on the battlefield. You know this – 155 mm. Our anti-tank guided missile systems have a longer range and are safer to operate than a whole range of other analogs. We offer our software solutions for defense, from management to cybersecurity. We are interested in localizing the production of equipment – so necessary for our defense – and each of those cutting-edge defense systems used by our warriors, which are delivering the best results for Ukraine on the frontline today. This kind of collaboration – in the production of weapons, equipment, and ammunition – is already being negotiated with our partners. Regarding what can and should be publicly disclosed today, I&#x27;d like to highlight recent agreements with the United States of America. We have reached agreements on joint production – essentially the establishment of a new industrial ecosystem that will strengthen both Ukraine and the United States, and all our partners. This is one of the key outcomes of my negotiations with President Biden in Washington, and a clear signal to the world that Ukrainian strength is not just worthy of trust but that the world&#x27;s strongest are ready to combine their potential with our strength – the strength of our state. Today, at this forum, we are announcing the creation of the Defense Industries Alliance. An alliance that values international law and is capable of working for the real protection of international law. Protection of security – I&#x27;m talking not only about Ukraine, but also about the security of any nation in the world from aggression. We have drawn up a corresponding basic declaration as the foundation of this alliance, and manufacturers of weapons and military equipment from all over the world who share our intention to provide real protection from aggression in this high-risk environment of our time can join it. Today, at its inception, 13 prominent companies have already signed this declaration, showing their readiness to build a new arsenal of the free world alongside Ukraine. I&#x27;m pleased to announce in this format, secondly, that Ukraine is developing a special economic regime for the defense-industrial complex. To give all the opportunities to realize their potential to every company that works for the sake of defense – in Ukraine and with Ukraine or that wants to come to Ukraine. Thirdly, in Ukraine, we will establish a special Defense Fund, which will provide additional resources, including for the development of military production and support of relevant collaborations, for the creation of new military facilities and programs needed to ensure defense and take care of our warriors. The fund&#x27;s resources will be an addition to the state&#x27;s expenditures on defense, defense production, and private investments. The fund will be replenished through dividends from state-owned defense assets and profits from the sale of confiscated Russian assets. Dear attendees, All our guests, all our citizens, Ukrainians! Soon, it will be 600 days of the full-scale war. 600. But no matter what happened, there hasn&#x27;t been a day throughout this long period when Ukraine felt any hopelessness and when Russia had even a glimmer of real hope to break us. We are confident in ourselves, confident in our citizens, in our partners. We are a strong nation. We are a courageous people. A state with global significance. We will undoubtedly prevail. We will create such a defense potential for Ukraine, and therefore for the entire free world, that it will be a reflection of our strength. I thank everyone who works in Ukraine, who works with Ukraine! And I invite everyone who wishes to multiply their strength to cooperate – with our country, it is possible. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our state can and will definitely become a donor of global security – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-09-30</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today we can already assess this week&#x27;s key result for our defense industry. A truly new stage of the Ukrainian defense industry&#x27;s development has begun. The first Defense Industries Forum took place. It was extremely successful. And it testified to the global interest in the opportunity to work in Ukraine and with Ukraine in the production of weapons and everything necessary for the real defense of any free nation. Our new format with defense companies – the Defense Industries Alliance – includes 38 member companies as of this evening. They represent 19 countries. These are the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada, Bulgaria, Australia, Belgium, our Baltic friends – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as well as the Czech Republic, North Macedonia, Slovakia, Spain, Croatia and Finland. This is a very powerful start, and the work is ongoing. More companies will join. In addition, our manufacturers signed 20 documents with partner companies at the Forum. Agreements and memoranda. Each such document then becomes a new production or an enhancement of existing cooperation. These are agreements on joint production, exchange of technologies, supply of components. Propellant powder production, munitions manufacturing. This is the training of personnel for our defense industry. Separately, and very thoroughly, we are developing the Ukrainian manufacturing of drones, land and naval autonomous systems. All in all, more than 250 companies took part in our Defense Industries Forum – and this forum is only the first one of its kind. Dozens of Ukrainian companies were among them. We are also working to ensure that Ukraine produces the air defense systems we need – truly powerful ones. When we eventually see and feel the maximum arms power of Ukraine in real action – of our manufacturers, our defense industry, our new cooperation with the world – we will be able to say that the foundation of this was laid right now, in the agreements like those reached at the Forum and during my visits, in particular to the United States, Sweden and other countries. All the most powerful countries are already cooperating or will cooperate with Ukraine. Our country will become one of the world&#x27;s key producers of weapons and defense systems. And this is no longer just an ambition or a prospect, it is a potential that is already being realized. I am grateful to everyone whose work leads to such results for Ukraine! Currently, and we have to be honest about this, Ukraine is a recipient of security assistance. But our country can and will become a donor of global security. In particular, thanks to our defense industry. Thanks to the strength, resilience, and indomitability of our people. Tomorrow is a very important day for Ukraine, for all our people. The Day of Defenders of Ukraine. Of the millions who have not only preserved Ukraine&#x27;s decent place in human history, but also make sure that our people and our state do not lose their history, fight for their lives and freedom, and inspire the entire free world with their struggle. Tomorrow, we will pay special tribute to all our defenders. Tomorrow we will honor the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine. For the first time, this day – the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos – will be on October 1. And let&#x27;s establish a new tradition for this day. October 1. 9:00 a.m. Wherever you are – on the main street of your city or just at home – stop for a minute, honor with silence the memory of our fallen defenders and think about those who are now in combat, on combat missions, at their posts. Those who save lives. Those who protect our people and state in every sense of the word. There would be no strength and will of Ukraine if it were not for all those who stood up for Ukraine. We are thankful. We honor. We remember. All together. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the Day of Defenders of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-01</span></div>
  <p>Fellow citizens! Dear people! What can you do in a minute? What significance can it have for history? What momentous steps can be taken in this one minute? All these questions are evoked by both today&#x27;s date and the place where I am now. Behind me is the Golden Gate. Around me is modern Kyiv. And the thousand-year-old majestic gate that protected the entrance to the capital is behind. In front of each of us and for the sake of each of us stand our modern-day guardians, our warriors along the frontline, who are defending our land today. Above the Golden Gate, the gate church of the Most Holy Theotokos was built that served as the heavenly protection of the city. The sky above us today is protected by the air defense forces and all our warriors, whose guardian is the Intercession. In a way, I, our people, and our country are now at the crossroads of history. On the way to tipping points. Where, with the memory of the past, we create the present and write a new page of our destiny. This is especially clear and noticeable on this day - the Day of Defenders of Ukraine. A state holiday that has become a truly national holiday. A people&#x27;s holiday. A holiday of millions of Ukrainians who defend their land and do not stop for a single moment. And today, at 9 a.m. sharp, as a sign of respect and gratitude to them, Ukraine will stop for one minute. The central streets and squares of our cities, transport, all of us, no matter where we are, should stop and honor the memory of the fallen heroes. And thank all our defenders. This time is a good opportunity to think about the important things. To remember the important things. To recall another minute – the first minute of the full-scale war. The minute that changed everything. Divided life into before and after February 24. Changed each of us. And the proof is the answers to the questions: who were we before February 24? Who are we now? Who should we become? February 24 began not when the clock struck midnight, but when the enemy launched an offensive. For us, the first minutes of that day were the first missiles and the first strikes on Ukraine. Addressing our defense and security forces at that moment, I said: &quot;Stand your ground! You are all we have...&quot; Today we thank everyone who stood, stands and will stand strong. All those who were the first to take on a difficult battle. Our border guards, our infantry, tank crewmen, pilots, sailors, artillerymen, anti-aircraft gunners, our paratroopers, special forces, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Guard, police, territorial defense. All those who defend the Ukrainian land, sea and sky. Whose protection we feel and whose courage we see everyday. Along the entire frontline, without a break, advancing during the ongoing counteroffensive. When Ukrainians from different regions, cities and villages are now together. In the same dugout, trench, in the same tank, aircraft, IFV. Side by side in different sectors, they are fighting for villages and towns they may have never been to before, but they are fighting as hard as they can as if those were their homes. Because that&#x27;s what they all became for us in the first minute of February 24. We thank everyone who defends our borders and frontiers, law and order and safety on our streets, protects our land from mines and shells, and our homes from fire. All those who defend Ukraine. All our security and defense forces. Soldiers, sergeants, petty officers, sailors, officers and generals who together prove that it does not matter what is on the shoulder boards, it is important what is in the minds and hearts. Those who have been doing this for the past 585 days and the past nine years. And to the question: &quot;Where was I on February 24?&quot; many will say: in the ATO and JFO area... I fought in Donbas. I defended Ukraine in the east, and then in all directions. I liberated Kramatorsk and later Kupyansk. I defended Donetsk airport and then the aerodrome in Hostomel. We all remember the day of February 24 well. It&#x27;s no exaggeration to say that I remember it almost minute by minute. How, addressing all Ukrainians, I said that from now on, we are all one big army of millions. The Ukrainian people made sure that these words remained not just words. Not mere rhetoric, but actions. And today, when asked what I was doing before February 24, many people will say: I had a civilian life. I was an IT specialist, an engineer, a farmer, an actor, a lawyer. I was who I dreamed of being. But I became who I had to become. A defender and a fighter. Because there are moments when the fate of the country is only in our hands. And then we must have weapons in our hands. And the one who was a wedding cameraman now sees other shots and flies drones into the sky, &quot;greeting&quot; the orcs. The one who transported passengers now transports the wounded from the battlefield. The one who swapped a downtown private clinic for a field hospital near the frontline. The one who used to sew fashionable clothes and now – body armor. And someone will say that on February 24 he was in his first year of study. But shortly after, he was breaking through the first line of the occupier&#x27;s defense. All those who had to grow up fast. And someone, recalling February 24, will say: I am a father, and in the first minutes I thought about my children. About the day when they will become adults and ask me where I was and what I did after February 24. And I know what I will answer: I went to defend us. And it is important for me to have this answer not only because someone will ask, but because one day you will ask yourself this question one way or another. Someone was on vacation abroad on February 24, someone was working there, someone was studying abroad. And thousands of them, traveling with many transfers and then even crossing the border on foot, returned to Ukraine to defend it. And, like millions of those who were here, they put aside all their affairs, work, and plans, saying: &quot;&#x27;All this will wait. After the war. After the victory.&quot; Dear Ukrainians! The purpose of this day is to honor the bravery and heroism of the defenders of Ukraine&#x27;s independence and territorial integrity, military traditions and the victories of the Ukrainian people. From the first minutes of February 24 to the present day, the whole world has been witnessing these victories every day. These are millions of Ukrainians protecting each other. All those in every region who took up arms and went to the front and to the territorial defense units. All those in every occupied city who took up Ukrainian flags and went to the squares. All those who made a rule: I will not stand aside and will do what I can every day. I will work, heal, train, teach, help, bring victory closer as best I can. I will protect and provide for the needs of the frontline, find, buy and bring everything necessary, manufacture equipment, weapons and ammunition. I will protect people&#x27;s homes from darkness and cold, strengthening and repairing the power supply system even under explosions. I will protect our people and the peoples of the world from hunger, sow and reap a harvest despite the mines in the fields. I will uphold the reputation of the state in the diplomatic arena, ensure support for Ukraine, and the commitment of our international partners to our struggle. I will protect people&#x27;s minds, eyes and ears from lies, disinformation, and panic. I will protect the truth. I will protect the state&#x27;s capabilities, communications, infrastructure, deliver critical cargo, evacuate people, rescue people. I will protect the lives and health of Ukrainians both on the frontline and in civilian life. I will protect the future, education, knowledge, children, and teach lessons against all odds. Protect culture, faith, and each other. These are all those who stay here, in their places, all those who say to themselves every day: I can do more, I can help more. I can contribute more! Dear Ukrainians! Tough times have made us strong. And the strong bring victorious times closer. Step by step. Today, tomorrow, every day, every minute. No one should and no one will manage to &quot;switch off&quot; our resilience, endurance, grit and courage on either scheduled or emergency basis. They have no &quot;expiration date&quot;, &quot;end date&quot;, or final point after which we would stop resisting and fighting, except for one - our victory. As we bring it closer every day, we say: &quot;We will fight for as long as it takes!&quot; We were doing it in the first minutes of February 24, we have been doing it for all these 585 days, and we will keep doing it. We stopped the invasion of a large enemy army, withstood and did not give up Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy and hundreds of other cities and villages. We are driving out the occupiers. And we will continue to do so. We became stronger, hardened, better equipped and armed. And we will continue to do so. We came through a difficult winter, we endure missile attacks and terror. And we will continue to do so. Being a defender means taking action every day. Being a defender of Ukraine means being with Ukraine every day. In Ukraine. For Ukraine. Behind us is our history. Ahead is our victory. And a free country. Which we defended, defend and will defend. It is important who we were. It is important who we have become and who we are now. It is important who we will become. What we will ask ourselves in the first minute of victory. What we will recall and say to ourselves. And when we achieve our goal, it will be the Day of our defenders and victors. We celebrate this day on the feast of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos. A people&#x27;s holiday that has become a state holiday. The Day of Defenders of Ukraine. A state holiday that has become a people&#x27;s holiday. And when the state and the people are together, they are always victorious. Glory to all those who are fighting and defending the homeland! Glory to our defenders! Glory to the Ukrainian people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our common victory explicitly depends on our cooperation – speech by the President of Ukraine at the EU-Ukraine Foreign Ministers’ meeting</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-02</span></div>
  <p>Mr. Borrell! Ladies and gentlemen! Distinguished guests! I am pleased to welcome you to Ukraine and to note the fact that the work of the EU institutions and European representatives in Ukraine and with Ukraine has become quite commonplace. It is through such work in various formats and at various levels that we ensure the restoration of the integrity of our common European home – the integrity of Europe, which is impossible without Ukraine. We consider today&#x27;s meeting – the offsite session of the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Ukraine - not only as a significant manifestation of solidarity with Ukraine, but also as a new step towards strengthening our Europe, adding to Europe’s leadership and initiative. It is very important for all of us to be able to take such steps in every area – steps forward, without halting. Adding to Europe’s activity, adding to Europe’s leadership. We need to constantly take new steps – defense and diplomatic, political and integration, economic and sanctions-related – that will consolidate our common ground. The more activity, leadership and initiatives we show, the fewer chances Russia will have to adapt to our joint pressure. Of its own accord, Russia has become an anti-European force that terrorizes and tries to undermine all the foundations of a stable and peaceful life in Europe. Most of the crises that our continent is experiencing have been provoked or fueled by Russia in one way or another. This has to stop. Hence, Russia must lose. Hence, we have to put pressure. Constant pressure. We must constantly bring the time of security for Europe closer. Ladies and gentlemen! We have already achieved significant results. And Ukraine is grateful to all of you for this vital assistance. We continue our offensive at the front. And step by step we are liberating our territory. It is extremely important not to stop and to destroy the positions of the Russian military and their logistics so that the occupier cannot adapt. We are protecting our people and economy from Russian terrorist attacks. In September alone, Russia used 246 missiles of various types, 746 combat drones (including 538 Iranian Shaheds), and 1159 guided bombs against Ukraine. The overwhelming majority of these strikes were aimed at civilian targets. Everything is equally a target for Russia – ordinary houses, central squares, schools, grain elevators, grain warehouses, ports, our power plants... Ukraine is grateful for every air defense system provided by our partners! We have managed to save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of infrastructure facilities. And the support that ensures all of this must be continued. This is the first point I would like to emphasize today: activity in providing support. This is literally an activity in protecting lives. Ukraine is grateful for the initiative to set up a separate defense segment worth 20 billion euros within the European Peace Facility to sustainably meet our defense needs. It is important to implement it in practice swiftly. We also look forward to the unblocking and disbursement of the 8th tranche of assistance in the amount of 500 million euros within the European Peace Facility. The implementation of the European strategy for the supply of artillery shells needs to be accelerated. This includes both joint procurement and increasing the production capacity of the European defense industry. We all need to understand that this is not only of security importance, as Russia is convinced not only by force, but also of economic one. The stronger the industrial potential of Europe, the better it is for Europeans. A few days ago we held the first Defense Industries Forum in Ukraine. More than 250 defense companies from over 30 countries were represented at the Forum. In particular, there were many European companies. This is a clear confirmation that the existing defense potential of both our country and all European countries can be significantly expanded. And this is just one of the multiple areas where Ukraine is already significantly enhancing the joint European potential. The training of the military – in particular, of our troops in the framework of the European Union Military Assistance Mission – also needs to be expanded. An obvious priority is to expand the range of training – to involve servicemen of our National Guard, State Border Guard Service, National Police, and Security Service of Ukraine in relevant training. Now, defending ourselves against aggression, we are gaining much-needed defense experience in modern warfare. The more successful our warriors are in defense, the more defense experience Ukraine will be able to share with you, with our partners. And a few other defense components. I am grateful to those European Union states that have joined our aircraft coalition. Now we are preparing our pilots and infrastructure in Ukraine to use the F16s. And this will definitely help our defense against Russian terror. We count on the integration of modules for training Ukrainian F16 pilots and engineers into the EUMAM Ukraine. It is also very important to maximize the reinforcement of Ukraine&#x27;s sky shield in the run-up to winter. The air defense systems our country received, such as Patriot, IRIS-T, NASAMS and others, are already playing a positive role and saving lives. We need more of these systems – in particular, a few Patriots for the protection of our southern regions can fundamentally change the situation and to a large extent make Russian terror meaningless. The second point is the Peace Formula. We must actively continue our diplomatic work to involve as many world leaders and states as possible in the implementation of our Formula. Objectively, it is in the interests of the world majority that the Peace Formula be fully implemented. And I am grateful to all those who have joined the effort and help us broaden participation, including the countries of the Global South. We have already had important meetings in Denmark – Copenhagen, and in Jeddah. We are preparing the third meeting now. And step by step we are bringing the Global Peace Summit closer. Ukraine counts on your countries&#x27; further engagement in the working groups established in accordance with the provisions of the Peace Formula and in efforts to involve African, Latin American and Asian countries in the work with the Formula. The whole world should be equally interested in the full force of international law. The third thing that is important to emphasize today is security guarantees. Obviously, ensuring geopolitical stability is a key prerequisite for lasting peace. NATO ensures such stability in Europe. We all agree that Ukraine will be a member of the Alliance. And the experience of the past decades shows how important this is. And how dangerous it is when there is a certain gray area in Europe without geopolitical stability. It is these gray areas that tempt the aggressor. We understand all the difficulties on the way to the Alliance. That is why we are currently working on security guarantees until Ukraine becomes a member of NATO. The architecture of such guarantees can help us with geopolitical stability. All of us – I emphasize, all of us, not just Ukraine. We are grateful to the G7 and all the states that are already working with us on relevant security commitments. Already 20 EU member states have joined the Declaration on guarantees, and it will be a powerful step when the other 7 states of the EU accede. Each such step towards accession is a clear signal to Russia that there is no alternative to peace and stability. We expect to sign the first bilateral agreements on guarantees with our partners by the end of the year. The fourth point is sanctions. Sanctions pressure on Russia is obviously not enough, dear partners. This is evident, first of all, in the growing number of drone strikes and air strikes by Russian terrorists. More joint work is needed to counter any form and scheme of Russia&#x27;s circumvention of sanctions. Any supply to Russia that allows it to increase its military production must stop. This is in the clear interest not only of Ukraine, but also of everyone in the world who wants this war to end as soon as possible. And I thank those of you who are already helping us in a powerful way to counter sanctions circumvention. Drafting a new EU sanctions package needs to be intensified as well. Any sanctions pauses prolong Russian aggression, and the pause after the 11th sanctions package has dragged on too long already. Obviously, sanctions are needed against the Russian nuclear industry – both for what Russia is doing at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and as a security measure against the use of dubious Russian nuclear technologies. Dubious from both a security and political point of view. It is also necessary to continue sanctions pressure on other sectors of the terrorist state&#x27;s economy. It is also important to expand sanctions against Iran in sensitive industries, including the import of equipment and chemicals. Every Iranian combat drone that hits European cities in Ukraine is a reason for sanctions pressure. And the fifth point is integration and recovery. Despite the full-scale war, we continue the institutional development of our country. Ukraine is constantly getting stronger. We have already demonstrated a historically important example of resilience when, after Russia&#x27;s attack on February 24 last year, our institutions withstood and continued functioning for the sake of the state and people. This proves the strength of Europe, the European state, and the European way of life. And we are adding to our strength. Ukraine will implement the seven recommendations of the European Commission that we have received. Ukraine will be ready to start negotiations on membership, and such negotiations should begin this year. We need an appropriate political decision from Europe. This integration step forward will show that Europe will never become weaker. We also clearly prove that Europe is capable of overcoming everything Russia is doing to destroy Europe. The process of rebuilding Ukraine after hostilities, the process of protecting Ukraine from ruins means protecting more than just our country. It is the defense of the idea of a united Europe capable of overcoming any challenge through joint efforts and real solidarity. And I am grateful to all of you who are already helping us restore our lives. We appreciate the efforts of every country, every leader, every European company. The launch of a financial instrument for Ukraine – the Ukraine Facility – with a total funding of 50 billion euros for the 2024-2027 period is a very important step. We hope that this instrument will be approved by the EU institutions in the near future. We must not forget that there is a very important component to the topic of recovery, and this component is justice. The aggressor must pay for the aggression – for the damage caused by it. That is why the frozen Russian assets must be used to finance the reconstruction. We look forward to accelerating the relevant work in the European Union. We are already actively working with partners to punish Russia for its aggression and terror. We support the work of the International Criminal Court to the fullest extent possible. But it is essential that Europe takes fair steps in relation to the assets of the terrorist state and its associates. Dear participants! Ladies and gentlemen! I am confident that Ukraine and the entire free world can prevail in this confrontation. But our victory explicitly depends on our cooperation – the more powerful and principled steps we take together, the sooner this war will end. End fairly. With the restoration of our territorial integrity and a reliable guarantee of peace for the whole of Europe. Thank you for being here today. This is a sign of your common support for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is only here in Ukraine that international law can prevail, and it will – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-02</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today is a European and EU day in Ukraine. It&#x27;s a very symbolic day: you can feel what it will look like, what it will sound like, what issues will be resolved and how they will be resolved when Ukraine fully joins the European Union. Today, the EU Foreign Affairs Council held an offsite meeting in Kyiv. All the foreign ministers of the member states, representatives of the European Commission and High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell were present. It was a very productive and substantive meeting. Truly in the interests of the whole of Europe. This is the first time that this Council has met outside the European Union in such an offsite format. But it is formally outside. We all know that it is only a matter of time before Ukraine becomes a member of the EU. So the meeting has actually taken place in the EU already. Objectively, our country is a leader in protecting the very foundations on which European unity rests. The unity of modern Europe, which values human freedom and equality of nations, values international law. Today we talked, in particular, about Ukraine&#x27;s full accession to the EU. Our key integration goal is to hammer out a decision this year to start membership negotiations. And today I heard once again at the meetings and negotiations that this is absolutely possible. Ukraine will definitely fulfill its part of the work – the seven recommendations of the European Commission. And it is very important that on the part of the European Union, all its member states, there is a similar readiness for a political decision on Ukraine, on beginning negotiations. Today I had the opportunity to talk to all the top EU diplomats at the bilateral level, at the level of the entire community. We had a good discussion on many issues. The key, of course, is our defense in this war, which is Russia&#x27;s aggression not only against Ukraine as a state, but also against Ukraine as a symbol of how free and democratic Europe can be. I thank our partners for their support – military, economic and sanctions-related. Today we paid special attention to the issue of sanctions. To Russia&#x27;s attempts to circumvent sanctions. I believe that every attempt by Russia to break the sanctions regimes and international law requires a strong response from the world. Any criminals – and especially criminals like those in Moscow – understand only the language of force and the inevitability of punishment. I had good bilateral meetings with Mr. Borrell and with the Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy, Mr. Tajani. Our defense, our cooperation. We discussed a lot of issues. I am grateful to Mr. Borrell for his sincere and kind faith in Ukraine and for his unwavering support. I would also like to thank the whole of Italy, personally Mrs. Giorgia Meloni, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs for especially sensitive assistance, in particular in the reconstruction of Odesa: an agreement was signed with Italy to restore Spaso-Preobrazhensky Cathedral in Odesa, which was destroyed by a Russian missile. Regardless of how much Russia destroys history and culture, Europe is capable of restoring everything. And this is the strength of Europe, our Europe – free and solidary. I would like to thank Denmark for its decision to open a branch of its Embassy in Mykolaiv. This is an exemplary case of patronage over the reconstruction of the region and an absolutely effective way to implement our agreements with Prime Minister Frederiksen. Thank you! In general, today we had quite a substantive discussion on the operation of our ports and security in the Black Sea. On grain exports and food stability in the world. We also discussed bolstering air defense. I am grateful to our partners for their understanding. I also met with the Minister of Defense of Estonia. I am grateful for the support already provided. And it is a tangible support. 16 defense packages from Estonia. Today we discussed our further cooperation. Plus two phone calls. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. We talked about political cooperation. About Solidarity Lanes in Europe and the Ukrainian grain exports, about support for our farmers. It is very important that everyone in Europe adheres to European norms and does not violate the agreements. This is a clear principle of Ukraine, and it is important that the same principle underlies the decisions of all European policy actors. I also spoke with President of the Government of Spain Pedro Sánchez. I thanked him for the principled defense and political support. Ukraine hopes for an effective Spanish Presidency of the Council of the EU. We also discussed the international events that we are preparing for together with Spain. Another important result today is that our Peace Formula is gaining more and more support. Thank you for that, too. And some more words of gratitude. Our warriors. The 58th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Hetman Vyhovskyi, our glorious &quot;Seventy-ninth&quot; of the Air Assault Forces and the 128th separate brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces – thank you, warriors, for your extremely steadfast and effective defense in the areas of Urozhaine, Maryinka, and Staromaiorske. You are Ukraine&#x27;s true strength. Well done! Glory to everyone who fights for our country and people! Thank you to everyone who helps! All the support for Ukraine, every step to help us will surely be repaid with global security to those who support us. When Russian aggression is defeated on our soil, the very idea of aggression will be crushed. It is only now that international law can prevail – only here, only in Ukraine. And it will prevail. We will be victorious! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Kharkiv does not just hold on, but helps keep our entire east strong – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-03</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I am in Kharkiv region. Kupyansk and Lyman directions, then the city of Kharkiv. Our warriors, combat brigades, commanders. Together with the team, we paid a visit to the 103rd separate territorial defense brigade, the 68th separate jaeger brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush, the 25th separate airborne brigade &quot;Sicheslav&quot;, and the 15th mobile border guard detachment &quot;Steel Border&quot;. Today I had the opportunity to talk to servicemen from other brigades as well. As always, we talked to the battalion commanders. Specific needs of the units. Weapons and supplies, as well as manning the brigades. There are things that need to be done, in particular, to ensure that our brigades have greater motivation and combat capabilities. I also had the honor to award the warriors who distinguished themselves – soldiers, sergeants, and officers. Different units, different combat paths, but equally strong Ukrainians! I am proud of all of them! It was a great pleasure to award our combat medics. Thank you all for protecting Ukraine, for confidence in Ukraine! Thank you for your chevrons and coins – I will keep them. Today I also held separate long meetings with all those responsible for defense and socio-economic situation in Kharkiv and the region. There are many issues that are important for the region. Especially in the run-up to winter. Especially given the constant Russian terror against Kharkiv, against the region and the occupier&#x27;s attempts to intensify the assaults on our positions. I heard a report from General Syrskyi, as well as from the heads of the regional Security Service of Ukraine and the National Police – detailed reports on the protection of Kharkiv region. We discussed the protection from Russian shelling, energy supply to the cities and villages of Kharkiv region, protection of energy facilities, restoration of housing and social sphere, as well as humanitarian demining with the relevant officials – the regional and city heads, the Minister of Energy, the CEOs of Ukrenergo and Naftogaz, and others. It is extremely important that Kharkiv, despite everything, does not just hold on, but helps keep our entire east strong. A proud and bright city that will always be a city of strength for Ukraine and the whole of Europe. The meetings also resulted in instructions on preparations for the heating season, reconstruction, and physical protection of energy facilities from Russian attacks. Everything needs to be fulfilled, and some issues require significant acceleration. Tomorrow I expect a detailed report on the restoration projects from the government officials. Separate instructions were also given to the military. In the coming weeks, we will be working very actively with our partners to ensure that our warriors have more weapons and ammunition, particularly air defense – this is most important. Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! Glory to all who defend our country and people. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Work in the regions on the physical protection of critical facilities and urgent reconstruction has to be carried out by winter – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-04</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report for the day. There were different meetings, and among the main ones was a meeting with the Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate. A substantive one. About good things for Ukraine – we managed to accomplish something important in security matters. More details later. On the conference call today, there was a report by the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine on countering collaborators. Also an informative one. Overall, we have reasons to thank our guys from the Security Service today. Important operations, and most importantly, effective ones. Well done! I held a meeting with government officials – we agreed on it yesterday in Kharkiv. We have various government programs to restore the regions and help people who lost their homes. There is work on rebuilding the social sector and physical protection of energy facilities. I have instructed to draw up a detailed report on these issues. We are doing our best to provide Ukraine with more air defense systems before winter. And now, by the way, we are expecting certain decisions from our partners. But all the work in the regions that relates to the physical protection of critical facilities and urgent reconstruction has to be completed as much as possible by winter. Today I also had an important conversation with Azerbaijani President Aliyev. I thanked him for the humanitarian aid provided to our country, in particular for our energy sector. We reaffirmed our common commitment to the principles of territorial integrity and protection of state sovereignty. We discussed our views on global and regional security formats and the security architecture in general. And today, I presented state awards to our Turkish friends. The Ambassador of Türkiye to Ukraine, who actively interacts with our country, fruitfully and powerfully strengthens our relations personally. In particular, he is working on the implementation of the Peace Formula. I also awarded the head of the Turkish company &quot;Onur&quot;, which actively cooperates with our country, invests, creates jobs and helps our defense. I am grateful for the support. And we are preparing for intensive international activities – this week and next week should be productive for Ukraine. We are constantly adding to our warriors&#x27; power! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>To ensure that in the future there is no war in Europe, our unity must work to the full capacity – speech by the President of Ukraine at the inaugural plenary session of the 3rd European Political Community Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-05</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Prime Minister! Thank you for your kind words about us, about our people, about Ukraine. Thank you everybody for your support! Dear colleagues! Each of us represents Europe. We may have our own views and, sometimes, different opinions on European issues. It’s normal. But still, we all are Europe. And it&#x27;s not just about geography. It&#x27;s about history, morality, and security that we share. This is the unity that has no right to become weaker. Because Europe should not be a ruin! This Tuesday I visited Kharkiv region – in eastern Ukraine. At least one million two hundred thousand residents – in Kharkiv. The distance from the city to the border with Russia is less than forty kilometers. Or less than three minutes of flight-time for an S-300 missile, which the Russian army uses to terrorize Kharkiv each day. Thousands and thousands of facilities have already been destroyed by such missiles! Houses, schools, universities, churches, power plants, transport. But Kharkiv – wounded by this terror, shattered by missile debris – is alive. We are doing everything we can to protect people and keep regular social and economic activity. We are keeping all key institutions working – from government agencies to our education system. In particular, in Kharkiv. Most children in the city study online. Until there is a fully effective air defense system, children cannot attend schools. But Kharkiv has found a solution. 65 school classes with more than one thousand children are taught not online, but in the usual way, as in schools in any other country, but… in the subway, under the ground. School classrooms that are provided with everything children need – furniture, equipment, Wi-Fi. But in the subway, under the ground. It&#x27;s 2023. And the subway is the only safe option for a city of a million people to bring children together for school. This is what the neighborhood with Russia means. But it is not only our neighborhood. Various European countries border the terrorist state, and in fact, Russian propagandists and officials talk about them as the next targets of their aggression. Targets. Exactly that’s the word. Dear leaders! Are there enough underground stations in your cities where it would be possible to organize protected schooling for children if Russia&#x27;s threats become real? And it is preparing to make them real. I will be honest with you, as I always am. Russia is now considering various scenarios for the coming years. One of them is particularly dangerous. If there is some pause in this aggression against Ukraine – any freezing of the situation, there will be a new critical moment. 2028. If Russia is allowed to adapt now, by 2028, the Kremlin will be able to restore the military potential that we destroyed, and it will have enough strength to attack the countries in focus of Russian expansion. In addition to Ukraine, these are definitely the Baltic states and definitely other countries where Russian contingents are present. This is clear information from our intelligence. We are signaling it to you. Russia is trying to freeze the situation, to adapt, and learning from its mistakes, and preparing to move on. Please remember that the most dangerous enemy is the one who made conclusions and prepared for the next attack based on these conclusions. Moscow clearly outlines its ambition – to capture more imperial space, to prevent Europe from being a place of free nations and working democracies, to break European unity. And war is Russia’s basic tool for this – a tool to enslave or to manipulate others. Russia tried for decades to keep control over the neighboring nations by starting wars and by freezing wars. Russia has hurt Moldova, tried to crush and divide Georgia, destabilize other parts of the Caucasus, strangles Belarus, tries to tear pieces from the body of Ukraine. Every nation that Russia is acting against in some way or another, every state that has suffered from Russian interference or invasion. We all have to stay in a special unity, stay together in a special cooperation and in a special relationship with everyone else in the European Union. We all need a format of support for the nations whose lives Russia has already tried to destroy, so that the ruin caused by Russia can never spread anywhere else. All these countries need economic support, and all these countries need security guarantees, so that Russia will not even be tempted to try to break their sovereignty ever again. A clear signal is needed – Russia has no chance. And most importantly, what will give our unity the full strength... The aggressor is most effectively neutralized by defeat – defeat in war. Right now, and right in Ukraine, we have the opportunity to cause a fundamental defeat to Russia&#x27;s aggression. Together with you and our partners, we have already done things that seemed impossible to many. Together we have defended Ukraine. Europe is more independent of Russia than ever before. Europe has truly proven that it has the right to be a global center for the protection of human freedom and international law. And no matter what happens in other parts of the world, no matter what political tornadoes our partners experience, Europe must be strong. Now Europe is following the developments in America – the growing political storm. Europe has its own potential for strength, and its global role, which should be as powerful as possible in all key issues that are important for Europe. And as for political storms. I am confident in America. Confident. They are strong people, strong society, with strong institutions, strong energy of democracy. I was recently in Washington. I talked to President Biden. I talked to congressmen from both parties, both chambers. They fully support the defense of freedom and understand that it is Russia and other enemies to our way of life who want to ride such political storms. So, we in Europe have to be ready. America helped us – helped Europe to survive. And now it is important for Europe not to hide sails from the wind trying to wait out the storm, but to be together in this uncertain time – to work united, and protect our values and our common space of liberty – common with the U.S. This mutual support – both in calm times and times of security challenges and turbulence – is the real meaning of the transatlantic partnership. Dear colleagues! Thanks to Ukraine, your soldiers are not fighting against Russia right now. We do not doubt NATO&#x27;s strength. But I&#x27;m sure none of you wants to find out what it will be like if, God forbid, NATO has to stand up for one of you. We have to win in Ukraine so that Putin cannot scale this aggression to someone else. And it is realistic. That&#x27;s why the key things are: Our unity. the unity and solidarity of all of Europe must be unwavering. The unity of all 27 EU countries, all Europe, not only the EU, the strength of our common rules and agreements, the firmness of the EU&#x27;s ability to expand under its founding treaties. And I thank all of you who truly work for the strength of the EU! Secondly, we must not allow Putin to destabilize any other parts of the world and our partners in order to ruin Europe&#x27;s power. We must continue to put pressure with sanctions, politically and economically, so that Russia cannot spread chaos. The presence of Russia, its military or proxies on the territory of any other country is a threat to all of us. We must work together to push Russia out of the territory of other countries. Thirdly, the capability of Ukrainian soldiers. Air defense in our country – especially now, before winter, the weapons in the hands of our soldiers, missiles and artillery with which we can destroy the positions of the occupiers and liberate our land and our homes. Every Russian drone shot down in Ukraine, every Russian tank destroyed in Ukraine confirms that this drone, this tank, any other Russian weapon destroyed in Ukraine will not strike anyone else in Europe. And I thank all of you – each and every one of you, your nations – thank you for your defense help! Additional air defense systems for Ukraine, additional artillery and shells, additional long-range missiles and drones for our soldiers, as well as additional formats of support and security guarantees for nations threatened by Russia – all this is a real protection of Europe from further aggressive steps by Russia. And to ensure that in the coming future there is no war anywhere in Europe, that no other city in Europe lives through what our Kharkiv and all the cities and villages of Ukraine are experiencing, then at this time: right now, this year, next year – and above all in Ukraine – our unity must work to the full capacity. Let only Putin&#x27;s ambitions be a ruin, not our countries, not our cities. Children of every country deserve to be secure – and everywhere in the country, not just in the subway, not just in shelters underground – but everywhere. We must make it possible. And we’ll do it! We must win! Thank you for your attention and for the invitation! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Today, our main message to the world is: evil cannot prevail - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-05</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, We are ending this long and eventful day. The day of the European Political Community Summit. Many meetings, important negotiations. We will have more air defense systems - there are clear agreements. This is crucial as we approach winter. Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom - thank you! There will be more artillery for our warriors. There will be more long-range weapons. And there will certainly be more justice. Today, Russian terrorists launched an attack that one can&#x27;t even call beastly. Because it would be an insult to beasts. A deliberate missile strike on a village in Kharkiv region, targeting a regular grocery store and a café. Russian military personnel couldn&#x27;t have been unaware of where they were striking. It was not a blind attack. People had gathered there for a memorial meal, a Christian memorial meal. Who could launch a missile at them? Who? Only absolute evil. Over 50 people have been killed, including a child, a six-year-old boy. My condolences to all who have lost their loved ones and dear ones! The wounded are receiving the necessary assistance, and I am grateful to everyone who is helping. In this village that the Russians struck, there were originally 500 residents before this war. And now, during the war, people have been leaving. It&#x27;s in the Kupiansk district, one of the areas where the front line has been particularly fierce… As of today, there were a little over 300 people left in the village. Over 50 killed among 300 residents. This is a brutal genocidal aggression of Russia. There are no words or papers that can stop such evil. And there is air defense. There is artillery. Our missiles. Armored equipment. Our powerful warriors who repel Russian assaults and advance themselves. There are our special services. There is Ukrainian intelligence. There are sanctions from the world. Sanctions against Russia for terror. There is international justice, in particular the International Criminal Court, capable of protecting justice. Russian terror must be defeated. And the world has the means to ensure this. The key is unity. The key is believing in freedom and protecting lives. Today, our main message to the world is: evil cannot prevail. And only now, only in Ukraine, can this principled moral position be maintained. But together, all together! I thank each leader of partner countries for our meetings today! I thank you for the clear support from the European Union and the European Parliament. Thank you, Spain, for giving us all the opportunity today to strengthen European unity. Unity is the answer. We will do everything to preserve it! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>To win this winter, overcome all difficulties, and provide protection to our people is crucial – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-06</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! I have just chaired a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff. Lengthy, with several key issues. First, of course, the front. The situation on the main fronts, reports from commanders, ammunition supply, and air defense. The second issue of the Staff meeting directly related to our defense, the resilience of our state. Energy. Preparing for winter, protecting our generation facilities, ensuring electricity and heat, and restoring everything damaged by Russian strikes and military actions. The current leadership of Russia always does what it has done before. They repeat all their mistakes. They repeat all the evil they have done. And when things don&#x27;t go their way, they think they haven&#x27;t done enough evil to succeed. Such insane logic. But we must take this into account. This winter, Russian terrorists will once again try to destroy our energy system. They cannot comprehend that Ukraine will not be subjugated anyway. But they will try to launch more attacks and more attempts to bypass our defenses. We fully understand the danger. Today, at the Staff meeting, there were reports from the military and all officials responsible for the defense of our energy and our winter passing strategy. This included the reports of the head of government, ministers, leaders of energy companies, representatives of the communications sector, and regional administration heads. Everything related to the physical protection of facilities, rebuilding, following orders, and the course of action in case of various emergencies. Winning this winter, overcoming all difficulties, and providing protection to our people is crucial. And, by the way, local authorities must fully perform their preparatory work. Next week, we will assess the current state of winter preparedness in the regions. We are taking further steps to strengthen our air defense and cooperate with partners to ensure the resilience of Ukrainian energy. This week has already seen significant reinforcement. Germany – we are working with Chancellor Olaf Scholz on transferring another Patriot battery to Ukraine. This will be a significant enhancement. Italy – I discussed with Giorgia Meloni, the Prime Minister, the content of a new security package for our country. Thank you! Spain – in negotiations with Mr. Sánchez, the Prime Minister of Spain, we not only agreed on additional Hawk air defense systems but also on support for energy equipment. Thank you! The United Kingdom – we have a very good agreement with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak regarding security in the Black Sea and Odesa region. It&#x27;s important that we don&#x27;t waste time and opportunities for export work. Ukraine must maintain its role as a guarantor of global food security and retain maritime access to the world market. I thank the UK for this support. And, of course, President Emmanuel Macron of France is doing exactly what we agreed on for greater security in Ukraine and all of Europe. There are significant results and new opportunities for our warriors. But as for the details, a bit later. Today, we also have a decision on a new package from the Netherlands, totaling over EUR 100 million, and this package focuses specifically on supporting our energy system. Shortly, we will discuss our next steps with Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Thank you! We are also working fruitfully with the European Union. It is important for us from all perspectives to start negotiations on EU membership this year. Ukraine has almost fulfilled the seven recommendations of the European Commission, and everything will be ready from our side. The Verkhovna Rada has one step left, and it is crucial for the deputies to take that step. The EU for Ukraine is not just economic security and a significant contribution to resolving the geopolitical stability issue. It&#x27;s also motivation. Motivation for us, for our warriors, for our entire nation. Motivation to fight, to be resilient, to overcome this winter, and to achieve our national goals despite any Russian terror. And one more thing. Kharkiv region... Yesterday, a brutal strike hit a village in Kupiansk district. 51 casualties. The fate of three more people is still unknown. This morning, a Russian strike hit Kharkiv, right in the city, hitting ordinary buildings with a missile. Two casualties, and they were from the same family. A 10-year-old boy and his grandmother. The younger brother of the boy, who is only 11 months old, and their parents are in the hospital. My condolences to everyone whose loved ones and relatives have been killed by Russia... Yesterday and today, leaders of states and many foreign affairs ministers expressed their condolences and condemned Russian terror. I am grateful to everyone who doesn&#x27;t remain indifferent. Only together, in unity, can we overcome terror. And we will do it. States, leaders, and nations. Many journalists, public figures, and ordinary people have supported us now and continue to support us throughout this war. Ukraine highly values every display of support, every manifestation of solidarity with us. Our victory over Russian terror will be a shared victory of all people in the world who, like Ukrainians, believe that evil and hatred must always be defeated. Always! This must be an unshakable global rule. And it will be. Glory to our warriors! Glory to all who defend humanity and people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Statement by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the terrorist attack on Israel</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-07</span></div>
  <p>Appalling news from Israel. I extend my condolences to all those whose loved ones were killed in the terrorist attack. We believe that order will be restored and terrorists will be eliminated. Terror must not be given a single chance anywhere in the world, because terror is always a crime not just against one country or its specific victims, but against humanity as a whole and our entire world. Whoever uses terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever sponsors terror commits a crime against the world. The world must stand in unity and solidarity so that terror never attempts to conquer or destroy life anywhere. Israel&#x27;s right to defense is beyond question. All the circumstances of this terrorist attack must be clarified so that the world knows and brings to justice everyone who incited the attack and helped organize it. All Ukrainian citizens in the danger zone should carefully follow the instructions of the security forces on the ground and closely monitor the information. Please stay safe! The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and our Embassy in Israel are ready to help in any situation. An operational headquarters has been established to assist Ukrainians in Israel. If you need assistance, please contact any of our diplomatic or consular missions immediately by any means available to you. Every life matters! We condemn every act of terror.</p>

  <h2>When terrorists attack, everyone who values life must stand in solidarity – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-07</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today, since morning, I have been in constant contact with our diplomats and intelligence. Due to the terrorist attack on Israel and the threat to our citizens in Israel, an operational headquarters has been established under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. All agencies and our embassy are monitoring information about Ukrainian citizens who may be in danger. As of now, the information about the possible death of one Ukrainian citizen is being verified and the search for two of our citizens is underway. As soon as the details regarding these people are verified, Ukrainian diplomats will announce it to the public. Please, dear Ukrainians, if you are in Israel now, be as careful as possible. Follow the instructions of the security forces and take care of yourself and others around you. If you need anything, please contact our embassy by any means available to you – Ukraine will help all its people, no matter what. Today, the whole world has seen horrific footage from Israel – footage of terrorists abusing women and men, taking even the elderly hostage without mercy... My condolences to all those whose loved ones have been killed! I wish a speedy recovery to everyone wounded. When such a terrorist attack occurs, everyone who values life must stand in solidarity. We in Ukraine are particularly sensitive to what has happened. Thousands of missiles in the sky of Israel... People killed right in the streets... Riddled cars with civilians... Abuse of hostages... Unfortunately, terror has also brought all this to the streets of Ukrainian cities and villages... Our position is absolutely clear: anywhere in the world, anyone who brings terror and death must be held accountable. Today&#x27;s terrorist attack on Israel was thoroughly prepared, and the whole world understands which sponsors of terror could have encouraged and organized this attack. Israel has every right to protect itself from terror. So does any other state. And it is very important for the whole world to respond to terror in a united and principled fashion. No support for terrorists! Wherever they aim their missiles and whomever they attack, terrorists must lose. And this is important for the whole world. Human life, peace and tranquility of nations are equally important everywhere – in Asia, Europe, Africa, America and Australia. Everywhere. Let the value of human life and the intolerance of terror be the principles that will finally unite the whole world. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Next week, we will work together with our partners for the unity of the world in countering terror – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-08</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today I spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. I extended my condolences over the numerous casualties caused by the terrorist attack. The Prime Minister informed me about the current situation and the actions of the Israeli defense and security forces. There is all the necessary cooperation between the Ukrainian Embassy and the Israeli police to find out the details about Ukrainians who found themselves in the areas of hostilities and shelling. Unfortunately, the deaths of two Ukrainian citizens have been confirmed. My condolences to the families and friends. The Embassy of Ukraine in Israel, all our diplomats who are in charge of this region, together with the intelligence service, are working around the clock to help all our people who need help. The Embassy has already received more than a hundred appeals from our citizens. The whereabouts of five of our people in southern Israel have been established. I once again address all Ukrainian citizens in Israel: please be careful and follow the instructions of the local security forces. It is very important that the whole world – the whole of it – does not stand aside from what has happened now and responds in the most principled way possible. Many people were shocked by the audacity of the terrorist attack. The audacity and thorough preparation. If terrorists can afford it, it means they are a threat not just to one country. And next week we will work together with our partners to ensure the unity of the world in the fight against terror. Various international events have already been planned. As always, the Ukrainian position will be in favor of unity and joint action. Terror has opened too many fronts against humanity. The war against Ukraine. The war in the Middle East. Terrible destabilization in Africa. Constant attempts to provoke a crisis in the world food market. Being strong in such conditions means standing up to terror. It is not enough to be a great country. It is not enough to be a rich country. It is not enough to have ambitions. To be strong is to help protect people and lives from all forms of terror. And that is exactly what it is. To help. To help. And today, this evening, I want to thank our people who save lives, who do everything to make terror lose... Zaporizhzhia region. Captain of the Civil Protection Service Anatoliy Beznos, emergency medical aid feldsher Yuliia Belyba, police Captain Serhiy Khokholiak. Thank you! Kherson region. Major of the Civil Protection Service Volodymyr Serhan, Sergeant of the Civil Protection Service Mykola Silin, police Major Oleksandr Skorniak, and emergency medical aid feldsher Vitaliy Rudakov. Thank you! Kharkiv region. Master Sergeant of the Civil Protection Service Serhiy Osyka, Chief Master Sergeant of the Civil Protection Service Oleksandr Nazarko, and feldsher Yana Fesenko. Thank you! And thanks to all the employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the National Police, our ambulance and every doctor and nurse who prove that terror cannot defeat life! And, of course, our unbreakable warriors. Kupyansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Maryinka directions... 58th separate motorized infantry brigade, 79th separate air assault brigade, 44th separate artillery brigade. Well done, warriors! I thank you for your fortitude and destruction of the occupier! As well as the brigades that have made progress in our offensive. Our &quot;Eightieth&quot; air assault brigade, 24th separate mechanized brigade and 93rd Kholodnyi Yar separate mechanized brigade – thank you! Glory to all who fight and work for our country! Glory to our strong people, the people of Ukraine! And thank you to everyone who helps to overcome terror! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our unity must and can stop the evil – address by the President of Ukraine at the session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-09</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President of the Assembly and dear Mette, Madam Prime Minister of Denmark, Ladies and gentlemen! We live in times when evil is trying to open a chasm between all of us and our desire for peace – our common desire! This chasm is growing every day. It is deepened by terror. And the more blood and pain there is in different parts of the world, the more countries are destabilized by evil, the more losses nations suffer, the more people find themselves in the midst of the rising tide of new migration and other crises, the more difficult it will be to maintain international order – a rules-based order. The only thing that can guarantee peace and serenity to all nations – rules, international law. We see who in the world is trying to replace the power of international law with the horror of blood and disasters. We see whose deliberate investments in terror are destroying the lives of different peoples in a vast area from Belarus to Mali. We see this. And we must act. United! These days, our attention is focused on the Middle East. No one can ever forget what the terrorists did in Israel. Thousands of missiles against peaceful cities. Shooting people in cars on the roads. Men, women, children. No one was spared. Streets covered in blood. Hostages. The terrorists themselves gave the world footage of the atrocities, and were proud of them. Women who were beaten. Elderly people who were kidnapped from their homes. Abducted children. And we do not yet know how many people were captured and brutally taken away by the terrorists. They even tried to humiliate the dead by mocking their bodies. We saw all of this in Israel. And the Israelis themselves – Israeli journalists who were here in Ukraine, who were in Bucha, are now saying that they saw the same evil where Russia came. The same evil, and the only difference is that there is a terrorist organization that attacked Israel, and here is a terrorist state that attacked Ukraine. The intentions declared are different, but the essence is the same. You see it. You see the same blood on the streets. You see the same civilian cars shot up. You see the same bodies of people who have been tortured. And the most dangerous are two things. First: the shocking joy of state-backed Russian propagandists. Just imagine – they call children who are now being held hostage by terrorists in Gaza as trophies. Such a word. Just as Russia has captured thousands of Ukrainian children during its aggression against Ukraine. And the second is backing of what is going on. Iran can’t say it has nothing to do with what is going on in Ukraine if it sells “shaheds” to Russia. Iran can’t say it has nothing to do with what is going on in Israel if its officials claim the support of what is going on in Israel. Ladies and gentlemen! How far can such evil go? No further than we allow it to. Our unity must and can stop the evil. Our desire for peace, not their desire for blood, should determine how the world lives. Our rules-based international order, and not their attempts to make death a rule. Sometimes terrorists’ leaders say, “what are the rules on which the international order is based?” As if they do not understand… And these are very simple rules. Very simple. Do not rape women. Do not kill. Do not consider children as trophies. Do not fill cities and villages with blood and do not shoot cars with civilians. Do not hit peaceful cities with missiles and drones. And one more rule – under any circumstances, we must bring to justice all terrorists and all those who help them. Isn’t the power of the world enough to stop the evil? I am sure it is. Now everyone in the world who values life and international peace needs to be as active as possible. This is not the time to withdraw from the international arena into internal disputes. This is not the time to isolate ourselves. This is not the time to remain silent or pretend that terror on one continent does not affect global affairs. Everyone can help prevent the chasm between the world and peace from widening. Europe should be active. The United States should be active. China. India. Arab states should feel how much can collapse if they allow terrorists to achieve their goals. Türkiye. Brazil and all of Latin America. Japan. Australia. Canada. African countries. Central Asian countries. Korea. Pakistan. Indonesia. The Caribbean. The Pacific states. Everyone should be active in the defense of life and international law! We must not give terror a single chance. Ukraine is grateful to everyone who has supported us in our defense against terror. I thank every country, every leader, all the nations that are with us. Those who help us with air defense and everything else. This is especially important now, before the winter, which Russia will try to make painful for us. I thank all of you who are working with us to implement the Peace Formula. All areas of our cooperation lead to one thing – to ensure that the UN Charter is fully effective in protecting Ukraine and our entire Europe from terror and aggression. And if it works here, it will work anywhere in the world. If there are real global sanctions for any sponsorship of terror, terror will lose. If the world unites whenever someone takes women hostage and kidnaps the children of another nation, terror will have no allies. If the one attacked by terrorists receives all the weapons it needs to protect its people, international law will be the only force that will determine how the world lives. And the world will live in peace. This is our common goal. Ladies and gentlemen! I urge your states and parliaments to be even more active for the sake of global unity. Let everyone who sponsors terror feel the power of our wrath. And let everyone who needs help defending themselves against terror feel the power of our solidarity. We must all be able to promise our children that we will leave them a world ruled not by blood shed by evil, but by freedom guaranteed by law. Thank you very much for your attention! Thanks for support! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Russia is interested in triggering a war in the Middle East to undermine world unity – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-09</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very eventful day. Various meetings, and among them those related to the latest international developments are of particular importance. I held a meeting with the heads of our intelligence, Main Intelligence Directorate and Foreign Intelligence Service, as well as with our diplomats on the situation in and around Israel and on the overall situation in the Middle East. This is of fundamental importance for us - not only for Ukraine, but also for the entire Europe. According to the available information – a very clear one – Russia is interested in triggering a war in the Middle East, so that a new source of pain and suffering could undermine world unity, increase discord and contradictions, and thus help Russia destroy freedom in Europe. We see Russian propagandists gloating. We see Moscow&#x27;s Iranian friends openly supporting those who attacked Israel. And all of this is a much greater threat than the world currently perceives. The world wars of the past started with local aggressions. We know how to counter this threat. We are preparing appropriate steps. And most importantly, we are defending the need for maximum unity in the world. Today, I addressed the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, first of all, on the issue of unity. Every state in the world must now choose how it will defend international law. Defend! Not stand aside when terror tries to take over, and when another region of the world may collapse before our eyes. I am grateful to all the leaders and states who are now fully aware of the danger and are ready to work together to keep the situation under control, to keep the obvious sponsors of terror from broader interference. Today I also held a meeting with Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk. We coordinated our positions for the coming weeks. I also met with Deputy Prime Minister Fedorov, Minister of Education and Science Lisovyi, and the ministry&#x27;s team. Working issues. One more thing. I have replaced the Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Anatoliy Barhylevych has been appointed commander instead of Ihor Tantsiura. The key task is that the development of the Territorial Defense Forces should not stop. Thank you to everyone who cares about Ukraine and fights for our country! We are preparing a new reinforcement for our warriors. I thank everyone in the world who has the courage to call a spade a spade and defend life and the rules-based order! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Strategic relations between Ukraine and Romania are a new force for the entire Black Sea region – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-10</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A really good visit to Romania. A fruitful one. Meetings with President Iohannis, the heads of the chambers of the Romanian parliament, MPs, and the Prime Minister of Romania. What have we achieved? First, there are good agreements on weapons. I can&#x27;t disclose everything now, but shells – affirmative, bolstering air defense – affirmative. We are still preparing some things. They will be powerful. A training center for F-16 pilots is being set up in Romania, and Ukrainian pilots will be among the first to be trained. Secondly, we stated that we are moving to the level of strategic partnership. There is a very clear meaning behind this political wording. As President Iohannis told me, we can rely on Romania. Romania can definitely rely on Ukraine. Together, we will significantly strengthen our region. We are already making a critical contribution to global food security through cooperation in the Danube ports and in the western part of the Black Sea. There will be more cooperation. We are expanding our transport corridors, there will be more jobs and economic opportunities. Today we signed a joint statement of the presidents that outlines our plans for the future. Third, we will soon open a new railroad line through Moldova, which will become a new transport corridor. Together with Moldova, we are moving towards the start of negotiations on EU membership – with Romania&#x27;s full support. I am grateful for this. The majority in the Romanian parliament supports us. The Romanian government – in the coming weeks, we are preparing a joint meeting of Ukrainian and Romanian government officials. I am grateful to Mr. President Iohannis, the entire Romanian political class and society. Our strategic relations are a new force for the entire Black Sea region. If we succeed in implementing everything we have planned now and which our teams will be working on, this part of Europe will get a new source of economic and security development. Thank you to everyone who supports us! It is good that today we managed to bolster our defense! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <p>Mr. Minister Austin! Thank you for your support and leadership. It indeed feels like a true warrior is leading the Ramstein team. Dear ministers, dear generals! I am grateful to each of you for your tireless work and for the strong joint decisions you have made for us, for all our people. Thank you so much. General Brown! This is the first time you are participating in a Ramstein meeting. And I think it is very symbolic, given your military background as a combat pilot – an F-16 pilot. I am sure that together we will do many good things to defend freedom. Jens, Mr. Secretary General! I thank you for your faith in Ukraine – for your confidence that Ukraine will be among the allies in NATO. Ladies and gentlemen! Next Monday will mark the six hundredth day of our resistance to Russia&#x27;s full-scale aggression against our people, against Ukraine. And today, no one can say for sure how many more days we will have to defend our independence and identity. But we can already say several things, which are important. First: Putin will not achieve Ukraine. Second: Russia cannot afford a new arms race. And third: democracy can win this battle. It is necessary not only for our country, but for every nation, for the whole world. Our time is not the time for the slavery of nations. You all know that Moscow&#x27;s ambitions have never been limited to Ukraine. And we all want these ambitions to be defeated in Ukraine – as soon as possible, this is the best opportunity – so that we don&#x27;t have to look for shells and supply tanks to other countries in Europe, Asia or Africa that the Russian dictator may try to turn into ruins or seize into his crazy empire or zone of influence. I know that NATO is ready and capable of protecting its members from external aggression. May we never have to experience this in reality. I know what steps can protect Europe and the world from the spread of Russian aggression. And I know what is needed to speed up the just end of this war – let me emphasize: a just end. Full protection of our sovereignty, full restoration of our territorial integrity, full guarantee of Ukraine’s security after the aggression. We are now in a special situation on the front line. In a situation where it is important to put pressure. Without any pauses. It is very important – without any pauses. You all understand the principles of effective defense. It is the defense that does not leave the enemy a chance to rest, recover, or choose any other tactics. Russia has lost the initiative for today. We are putting pressure on it. We are! It is Ukrainian courage and your support that determine what is happening on the battlefield and, most importantly, what will happen on the battlefield. And although the occupiers are still trying to storm our positions, although our defense and counteroffensive actions are very difficult – it is still Ukraine, it is our soldiers who determine the course of events. Russia cannot handle this war on its own. You can see it. It needs Iran – Russia cannot succeed without the Shaheds and other help. It needs North Korea. Just imagine – for the first time in its history, Moscow has gone to Pyongyang to bow down. The Russian Black Sea Fleet is escaping our naval drones and missiles. Traditional buyers of Russian weapons see how superior the weapons made by the free world and used by Ukrainians are. Russia is slowly but surely withdrawing from various points of geopolitical fractures in the world because it lacks its own strength. But at the same time, it still has enough resources to incite conflicts and turn them into full-scale tragedies. This is happening in the Sahel, and it can happen even more painfully in Israel and in the Middle East as a whole. We must not allow this to happen. We can prevent it! We have to put even more pressure so that the aggressor weakens faster and does not have time to adapt to our pressure. We need to make sure that Russia is heading for defeat and does not even attempt to claim anything else. One of the most vital battles here is the one against the Kremlin’s key tool, its greatest perverted pride – the pride of the terrorist. Last winter, Russia wanted to turn it into a weapon against us by destroying our power plants and supply network. I am grateful to all of you, every country, every leader who helped us with air defense and energy equipment. It really was a life-saver for all of us, our people, our children. Obviously, this winter Russia will try to repeat those tactics, but with certain conclusions and greater terrorist efforts. Please note that even during the attack on Israel, terrorists targeted one of the largest power plants in the region. Until last winter, when Russia relied on these tactics, other terrorists had not done so in such attacks. Of course, our task now is to get through this difficult time, through this winter. But, in fact, the real power of this task, if fulfilled, is much greater than just getting through this winter. Air defense is a significant part of the answer to the question of when this war will end and whether it will end justly for Ukraine. I am confident that it can be so. It will be so. Everyone can see what the protection of the sky gives. It is a guarantee that there will be normal life in the cities. There will be an economy. There will be people. Long-range air defense can also ensure the functioning of our corridors in the Black Sea and the Danube region. Air defense will ensure that Russian jets will not be able to approach our borders. And therefore it will solve the issue of Russian guided bombs. We all need this kind of push now. A step forward in our defense. Air defense. For Ukraine, this will be a victory of life. It is vital. For Russia, it will be a failure of its key strategy – the strategy of terror, what will it have left but this? We need to protect people. We need the opportunity to live and accumulate economic activity. We need normal exports. Grain is the key to global food security – Ukrainian grain. Then there is metallurgy. Other goods of our exports. It is the economic basis of life. We need children to be able to study at schools, not online. And we need people to live not only from one air alarm to another, but based on their plans for days, weeks… better – months. When this happens, the majority of our people who have found temporary refuge abroad will start to come back. Millions of Ukrainians! The stronger we are socially and economically, the more powerful we will be in the military sense. We will be able to ensure the work of a greater number and capacity of defense industries in Ukraine. We will be able to depend much less on the assistance of our partners. We will be able to provide more support to the front line. Dear friends! We must win the winter battle against terror. We can win it. And along with it, we can win the battle for how and on whose terms this war will end. Ukraine can survive. It will survive. However, it is important to take the weapons out of the hands of our enemy. What is Russia’s strength? Let’s be honest. Only the fact that they can destroy lives. Russia is not capable of doing anything else. Is it a security donor? No. A supporter of development? No. A political pole? No. A source of economic growth? No. A terrorist? Yes. That is the only thing! That threatens Ukraine and many other nations. We need to get this instrument out of Russia&#x27;s hands – the instrument of terror. The answer is air defense and other types of weapons, the list of which we will discuss and my team will share with you. And above all, please remember that this will not only help to bring a just end to the war for us, but will also keep the war away from you, from your borders and the borders of your allies – from the Alliance. Missiles and drones will not fall in Romania, Poland or elsewhere if they cannot overcome the protection of the Ukrainian sky. Terrorists like Putin or Hamas seek to hold free and democratic nations as hostages. And they want power over those who seek freedom. The terrorists will not change. They just must lose. And that means we must win. We do! It requires patience. It requires steady and continuous support. We need to take the right steps. Steps that save lives. For real. Vital steps. And strengthen the defense. Significantly. Air defense is a must. I’m sure you heard me. Thank you for your invitation! Thank you very much for your attention! And for your common big support during all these days, weeks, months of full-scale war! I thank you and your nations! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Our warriors and the entire nation are getting stronger every day – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-11</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A report on our work in Brussels today. First of all, a meeting in the Ramstein format, our broad defense coalition, more than 50 member states. Defense ministers, top military officers. Our main focus is to strengthen our air defense and the most important tools at the front. Artillery, long-range systems. I am grateful to all partners for their continued willingness to help our defense. Defense Minister Umerov outlined the details of our priorities to our partners. I met with U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin and the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Brown. The meeting was long and specific. It was made clear that America will continue to provide Ukraine with the sustainable and uninterrupted support necessary for our defense. We discussed how to boost our capabilities in defending ourselves against Russian terror – drones and missiles – now, before winter. I am grateful to the United States! I had a good meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. We discussed our defense priorities, our cooperation with the Alliance. Today, a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council was held at the level of defense ministers, and tomorrow a meeting of NATO defense ministers will take place. Of course, we are working on further support for our warriors, on very specific things, including the supplies that the guys told me about when I was at the front, visiting brigades on the front line. The talks with the Prime Minister of Belgium were very important and productive. Belgium has joined our aircraft coalition and will provide Ukraine with F-16s. This is a powerful step. There is a new defense package from Belgium, which has several important components. I would like to mention air defense missiles in particular. Thank you! Belgium became the first country in the world to actually use frozen Russian assets to compensate for the damage caused by Russian aggression, and next year we will receive €1 billion 700 million for our defense and recovery projects. This is very important, and I am grateful to Belgium and personally to Mr. Prime Minister De Croo. As for the sanctions against Russia, we discussed the introduction of a procedure by Belgium and a number of other influential countries to prevent Russian diamonds from being supplied to the European market. This is a blow to Russia&#x27;s profits. This long-awaited step will become a reality. So, it was a powerful day! Belgium, thank you! All allies in Ramstein, thank you! The United States, I am grateful for your leadership and support! Every day our warriors and our entire nation are getting stronger. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The resilience of the resistance depends on the continuity of support - speech by the President at the 4th session of the ministerial roundtable on support for Ukraine in Marrakech</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-12</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and gentlemen! I am glad to address you. First of all, I would like to mention a terrible natural disaster that happened this fall. On 8 October, it was one month since the earthquake in Morocco that claimed lives of many people, destroyed homes and left children parentless. My condolences to all those who lost their loved ones, and my gratitude to all those who helped people escape the disaster. No one can stop the natural events that happened on the planet. But we all have to make sure that the evil element of human nature does not destroy lives and leave ruins. And we must cooperate to save from destruction every nation against which the gates of terror or aggression have been opened. I thank everyone who is helping Ukraine defend itself from Russia’s unprovoked and brutal aggression. And I thank all those assisting in the rebuilding of Ukraine after the attacks from Russian artillery and missiles and Iranian killer drones. Almost 3,000 Iranian drones were used against us in the war of terror. Ukrainians will always be grateful to every leader and every nation that support us. But please do not forget that when it comes to protecting lives from aggression and terror, one of the main factors is the continuity of support. The resilience of the resistance depends on it. When an aggressor finds itself on a trajectory of defeat, as Russia does in its war against us, it always relies on one thing. It is not ready to admit that its decision to launch an aggression was a mistake. It is not prepared to retreat from foreign land. Not yet, but the day will come. And to prevent it, Russia tries to make one last bet – bet on the idea that the world won’t be able to support the defense of life and nation’s freedom as long as needed. We are now at a point when it is decided whether aggression and terror will once again become a customary way for one nation to relate to another. What then becomes of our world? What becomes of the children of our nations? Let them learn what education is – before they learn what weapons are. And let them learn the word “happiness” before the word “war”. So, I propose five points. First, there should be such powerful and truly global sanctions against anyone who destroys lives, so that the destroyer pays the highest price for its aggression. And I thank everyone who supports Ukraine with sanctions against Russia. Second: the assets of the aggressor and the assets of all those who help him must be confiscated to compensate the damage caused. And I am grateful to all those who are doing this work now with the Russian assets in favour of our nation. Third, we need real guarantees of long-term financial support to protect life. The resilience of defence is always based on the resilience of society. And when there is such support, aggressors and terrorists will not have the illusion that they can outlast and win something for themselves. Of course, the use of funds should be fully controlled and accountable – just as it is with funds for Ukraine, by the way. We use the support just as intended. Fourth: a reliable mechanism must be introduced to stimulate private investments for a nation that conducts a just defense, especially a mechanism for insuring military risks and multiplying donor capital with private capital. This is something that will always be of help. And the fifth point is quite traditional for our world. This is about boosting export credit agencies and project financing to ensure the implementation of investments and infrastructure projects. And when we talk about all this, it is important to hear not only Ukraine. That’s what makes Ukraine resilient in the fight for independence and brings our nation’s victory closer being a model of assistance for any other free nation. Together we can create a working model of how to make the world secure from evil element of human nature. Thank you for your attention! Thanks for your support. I wish you all peace! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>The immediate priority is to digitize the entire supply accounting for the defense forces – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-12</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! The main points of today: I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff. As always, the commanders reported on the situation at the front – the main directions and the most contested areas. What the occupiers are trying to do, and our rebuff. Special attention is currently being paid to both Kharkiv region and the South, as well as Donetsk region, especially the battles near Avdiivka. I am grateful to every warrior and every unit for their resilience. In general, we have reason to commend the 53rd and 110th Separate Mechanized Brigades, the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, and our powerful 79th Airborne Assault Brigade. Only these days, and only the warriors of these brigades have already destroyed hundreds of occupier&#x27;s armored vehicles. Of course, I cannot but mention the results of the 55th Separate Artillery Brigade, which is fighting in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Thank you, warriors! Traditionally accurate. Today at the Staff meeting, we discussed, among other things, how to provide our warriors with more of our own Ukrainian weapons capabilities. We are grateful to every leader, every country that helps us with weapons, equipment, and ammunition. And we are doing everything to increase the supplies. By the way, yesterday&#x27;s &quot;Ramstein&quot; meeting helped with this. But it is evident that the state&#x27;s fundamental course is our own production, our own weapons, equipment, our own ammunition for all positions needed for the defense forces. Everything – from missiles and drones to armored vehicles and ammunition of the required calibers. The Minister of Strategic Industries has already presented reports to me on several fronts: &quot;armor,&quot; missiles, and ATGMs. Today, at the Staff meeting, the Deputy Prime Minister for Innovations presented a report on EW – electronic warfare. We are developing a comprehensive program for all these directions with clear timelines and volumes. Another immediate priority is to digitize the entire supply accounting for the defense forces. Digitalization will provide a clear understanding of how our warriosr are being supplied and where deficits are occurring and how they are being filled. This is crucial so that we can promptly show every one of our partners information about each unit of weaponry supplied. It&#x27;s essential that the reports here in Kyiv match the actual facts on the front lines. I also received a report from the Foreign Intelligence Service on the situation around Israel and the Middle East region in general at the Staff meeting. We are monitoring all the information and maintaining contacts with partners to prevent destabilization. We clearly understand that the only one interested in the worst-case scenario is our enemy. I&#x27;m grateful to everyone worldwide who is making efforts to prevent an explosion in the Middle East and to hold terrorists accountable for their actions against Israel – against children, women, and ordinary people. We also remember the citizens of other countries who have been taken hostage or killed by terrorists. There are Ukrainians among the casualties. My condolences to all who have lost their loved ones! This is extremely important – and important for everyone in the world, even for those who may not yet understand it – that terrorists always be held accountable for the evil they inflict. A few more points. There are the first sanctions from the United States against companies that have violated the globally established price caps for Russian oil. Thank you for taking such a sanctions step. It is important to continue the pressure and deprive Russia of the ability to finance aggression through any energy resources. There is a decision by the International Olympic Committee, which suspended the membership of the Russian Olympic Committee. Everyone in the world should respect the territorial integrity of nations and the UN Charter. And if someone in Russia thinks they can use sports and the Olympic movement as a weapon, that will definitely not work. Thank you to everyone who defends the principles of Olympism. And a long-awaited step for historical truth. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe recognized the Holodomor of 1932-33 as the genocide of the Ukrainian people. Grateful to all the members of the PACE who voted for such recognition. Justice is always stronger. Thank you to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We need reliable geopolitical stability in Europe and in the whole Euro-Atlantic space – address of the President of Ukraine to the leaders of the countries of the Joint Expeditionary Force</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-13</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ulf, Mr. Prime Minister, I can see Rishi, I see Mette, I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t see everybody but I&#x27;m happy and I know that all of you and your nations with us. Thank you so much for all this time that you supported and support us. Dear colleagues! I am glad to greet all of you! And I am glad that this format of cooperation – Joint Expeditionary Force – is effective and becoming stronger. Now is the time for collective efforts. It does not mean that capabilities of one nation are too weak. It means that the task we face is too big. We need reliable geopolitical stability in Europe and, more broadly, in the whole Euro-Atlantic space. So, we need new collective forms of cooperation and strengthening of existing ones. Because we see what modern aggressions and terrorist attacks are. If an enemy of freedom has significant resources and boundless cynicism – like Russia, like Hamas, like other terrorists – then free nations need a really full-scale defense… Fast, as flexible as possible, not limited by outdated procedures and one that can be maintained – as long as is needed. In our Euro-Atlantic space we have NATO. Mainly. But not all democratic nations are engaged into this form of defense. That is why Ukraine, being on the road to NATO, is developing a system of security guarantees. And I thank those of you who joined us in this process. Geopolitical stability is the basic element for all other forms of stability. Can a nation alone guarantee geopolitical stability for itself? Definitely not. Can the main Alliance existing on our continent, NATO, do this? Yes, but only if its members know how to be allies. Regional formats of cooperation give this very practice – knowledge of being allies. In one or another area. At one or another historical distance. Knowledge of being allies is not gained easily. It does not come automatically. It is not a consequence of a formal decision to join the Alliance. It is day-to-day cooperation. These are also our coalitions – defense coalitions that help us to stand against Russia. The capabilities of large alliances grow on the basis of meaningful local cooperation. Currently we are working on creating new formats of cooperation and strengthening the existing ones in our region – the Black Sea region. I visited Bucharest, and at the meeting with President Iohannis we agreed that the relations between our states, Ukraine and Romania, deserve the level of strategic partnership. We are also working effectively in the Ukraine-Moldova-Romania triangle. In particular, in logistical cooperation – for the export of food produced in Ukraine, which is critically important for the food security of the world. This also has potential for the energy industry of our countries – for energy independence from Russia. We have a common understanding of security challenges as well. Ukraine has extremely important cooperation with Bulgaria and Türkiye. We all have to remember that joint security and development of the economy, infrastructure in the Black Sea region are some of the keys to the geopolitical stability of entire Europe. New security perspectives will also emerge due to changes in the South Caucasus region neighbouring the Black Sea. This will add potential to our joint security here, in our part of Europe. Especially when thanks to our defense from Russian aggression, new prospects will open for Georgia – to restore its territorial integrity. All of us are now at a historical turning point. We have only two options. Either terrorist Russia will succeed in breaking freedom. And then the zone of geopolitical instability, which exists in the east of Europe, will spread throughout the continent. Or thanks to many levels and formats of cooperation, in particular regional ones, thanks to our common protection of freedom – Russia will lose in this confrontation. After it has lost, and as a result, a historic chance for geopolitical stability along the entire line from Scandinavia through Minsk and Kyiv to the South Caucasus will be realized. Did previous generations have such a chance? Honestly, they didn’t have. Because Russia has always kept the potential for destabilization. But now – we have it. And we have to use it. I am sure we will. Dear leaders! Now, before winter comes, we should all focus firstly on hybrid terrorist threats from Russia. We saw last year what the Kremlin was betting on, namely strikes on the energy infrastructure to destroy the basis of modern life. We predict that this winter Russia will try to repeat its terror tactics, only on a larger scale. It is important now to be ready for any terrorist attacks, for any Russian actions. We must stand this battle. Air defense, namely the defence of our cities, our energy infrastructure and export corridors in the Black Sea, is the key to winning the winter battle for Ukraine. And I thank those of you who have helped all of us to protect our skies against Russian missiles, drones and against Russian jets. The Kremlin must begin to get used to its losses, and the loss of the second winter, the loss of its energy terror will definitely give strength to all of us – it will be easier to lead Russia with losses in the future. But for this we still need to work together – much more! – at the global level, at the regional levels, and in bilateral, of course, format. So that after this winter, we will be able to record – on the basis of our cooperation, of our common efforts, our joint victory is gradually growing and, thanks to it, the establishment of geopolitical stability in the entire Great East of Europe is approaching – real, reliable one. And it will be so. Thank you for your support, invitation, thanks for everything! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>As terror is spreading, it is important for the world to give an unambiguous signal that protection against terror will not falter anywhere – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-14</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! This week is coming to an end, the week of air defense for Ukraine, the week of reinforcement. This is a key priority before winter. And it&#x27;s time to thank our partners for their new decisions on support. This week&#x27;s decisions. The Netherlands – talks with Mark Rutte in Odesa, the decision on additional Patriot missiles, support for our ground operations and sea export corridors. There is also a defense package that was announced at Ramstein. Thank you very much! There are packages from Spain, packages from Britain. Norway, Finland – thank you. Germany. A joint defense package from the Czech Republic and our friends from Denmark. I thank all the leaders for fulfilling our agreements! Along with additional missiles for air defense, there will be new launching stations - we are working on different types of systems. There will be spare parts for the systems that Ukraine already uses. Of course, there will also be artillery – shells, first of all. Drones. Armored vehicles. All the leaders who help us are fully informed about the current situation on the battlefield. The world understands what Russia is preparing for and what terrorist moves it may be planning. We also know how to respond to the occupier. And we will respond in a powerful way. Before the Ramstein meeting in Brussels, I had a good, much-needed meeting with Secretary Austin and the new head of the U.S. military, General Brown. There was a clear confirmation of support for Ukraine, a clear willingness to intensify our actions together and continue to put pressure on the occupier both in the fall and winter. And by the way, the United States announced at Ramstein that it will co-chair the F-16 coalition with the Netherlands and Denmark. This is an important decision, thank you very much! We had excellent talks with the Belgian government. We are grateful to Belgium for joining our F-16 coalition and for its leadership in the use of frozen Russian assets. This is a truly necessary step – Belgium became the first country to send funds generated by Russian assets to Ukraine. We are working with other EU countries and the rest of the world to ensure that they use the aggressor&#x27;s funds in the fair way – to defend against aggression. I would like to make a special mention of the conference in Croatia that took place this week - on humanitarian demining. Almost a third of our territory is under threat from mines and unexploded ordnance. Obviously, we need global support to clear our land of Russian mines. And now in Croatia, there were more than 40 countries and international organizations participating in a conference on this very issue. There are new decisions on support for demining. I am grateful to every country that joined! As terror is spreading across the globe, it is important for the world to give an unambiguous signal that protection against terror will not falter anywhere. Of course, our warriors. In all areas where it is particularly hot right now. Avdiivka, Maryinka and other key locations in Donetsk region. Klishchiivka, Kurdiumivka, Andriivka. Staromayorske. Of course, Kupyansk direction. Zaporizhzhia region - Orikhiv, Robotyne, Verbove, Novoprokopivka. I thank everyone who is holding their positions and destroying Russian troops. Every day of these battles is lives. Lives that are sacrificed for the sake of our country. And this is the life of the whole of Ukraine, which is being saved every day, every night by every successful battle. It is so important! Glory to you, warriors! Glory to our people! And thank you to everyone in the world who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everyone must do their part in defense to prevent Russian terror from stopping Ukraine this winter - address by the President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-15</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A few important things about this day. All day long, power engineers and rescuers have been working very actively in Kherson region and also in Donetsk region to eliminate the consequences of strikes on power facilities. In particular, there were power outages in Kherson today due to Russian bombs. Our repair crews are doing their best. As of now, Kherson has electricity and water supply restored in almost the entire city, except for ten houses in the Tavriyskyi neighborhood. As for these houses, the repair work should be completed tomorrow. We must be aware that there will be more such Russian attacks as winter approaches - on generation facilities and the grid. We must be prepared for this. We will strengthen our air defense as much as possible in the current circumstances. And even more: we are agreeing with our partners on such defense steps that have not been used before. However, a lot will depend on the readiness of local authorities, particularly in cities, and on the preparatory work of energy companies and telecom operators. Everyone has to do their part in defense to prevent Russian terror from stopping Ukraine this winter. Just like on the battlefield, we must be as resilient and strong as possible in all areas. The week&#x27;s schedule includes new meetings, new conversations with partners on strengthening Ukraine and our defense. We will also work to make the reconstruction process in Ukraine more active. We are also preparing new steps to ensure that in the current security situation in the world, attention to Ukraine is maintained at a sufficient level. Ukrainian diplomats, intelligence, and security forces continue to work to help our citizens who have found themselves in the Middle East: in Israel and the Gaza Strip. The evacuation of Ukrainians from Israel continues: more than 200 people have already been taken to Romania, mostly women and children. New flights are being prepared. We know about almost 260 Ukrainians who are currently in the Gaza Strip. Currently, the exit from Gaza is blocked for citizens of all countries, but we are working with our partners to evacuate our citizens. Ukrainian diplomats are ready to help every citizen who needs it. Therefore, I once again appeal to all Ukrainians who may be abroad and need help: please contact our diplomatic missions abroad at any time and in any way. And one more thing. Every day our cities, villages in the regions bordering Russia and along the front line are subjected to terrorist attacks by the occupier. And every day, our people receive help there, which is very important. No matter what happens, Ukrainians take care of each other, and the state remains functional. Ukraine cannot be defeated because our people cannot be defeated. Please support and thank everyone who works for the sake of people, who protects lives. Our rescuers, doctors, nurses, volunteers, police officers, utility workers, power engineers – those without whom there would be no normal life. Everyone is important. Everyone deserves gratitude.

  <h2>We are working to provide our warriors with more air defense, more protection for our cities, so that they can maintain life – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-16</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! It was an eventful day. It is important that today, on the 600th day of the full-scale war, Penny Pritzker, the U.S. Special Representative for our сountry&#x27;s recovery, arrived in Ukraine. Such a visit on such a day is an important signal. It was a good meeting. We managed to discuss all the issues that directly affect life in Ukraine. Protection of our energy sector, especially this winter. Macro-financial support. Reconstruction. Protection of investments from the war risks. Attracting private business. Each of these areas is an element of the overall structure. A structure that ensures a normal life for our people and our cities. As much as it is possible now. We are working as hard as we can to give our warriors more air defense. To give more protection to our cities, so that they can maintain life, including economic life. Plus, the development of our industries, including defense production. All of this together keeps us resilient. All of this together adds to Ukraine&#x27;s strength. And I am grateful to each of our partners – everyone who helps. To all those whose support programs are long-term. To everyone who understands that this is a marathon, and in a marathon you have to keep the right pace all the time, calculate your energies and see clearly that the race must end with victory. I had several phone calls today. With the President of Finland and the Prime Minister of Canada. The situation on the battlefield. Support for our defense. The Peace Formula. We continue to prepare a new meeting in the format of national security advisors. I am grateful to both the President of Finland and the Prime Minister of Canada for their steadfast and principled attention to Ukraine, for their sincere faith in Ukraine and in our people. We also discussed the situation in the Middle East. Prevention of further escalation. And assistance to people, protection of people. It is important to ensure that what is happening in the Middle East does not turn into an even bigger catastrophe. And our warriors. Gratitude every day. The warriors of the 110th separate mechanized brigade, the &quot;Seventy-ninth&quot; of the Air Assault Forces, and the artillerymen of the 55th brigade. Thank you, guys, for your power! For the kind of destruction of the Russian occupiers that Ukraine needs. Also, the paratroopers of the 82nd separate brigade and the warriors of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Air Assault Forces. I thank you for your courage and your efficiency in the offensive. Every step of ours is important. Every enemy loss is significant. Thank you! And separately, our intelligence. The fighters of the Kraken special unit of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, who are defending the area of Kupyansk. Thank you, guys! Thank you for your fortitude and efficiency! Glory to all our warriors! Today I have signed new decrees on honoring warriors with state awards. Over the course of this war – the full-scale war – more than 60,000 Ukrainians have been awarded for their participation in battles for the sake of the state. This is truly full-scale courage. Courage that is rooted in the character of our people. The character that does not give up. The character that will prevail. For sure. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We have a result in our advancement – address by the President of Ukraine following the meeting of the Staff</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-17</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff. The commanders delivered important reports. I thank every warrior, every brigade of ours who are firmly holding their positions. Avdiivka, Bakhmut direction, Maryinka, Shakhtarsk direction. Kupyansk and Zaporizhzhia direction. Well done, guys! I am grateful to those who are effectively destroying the occupiers&#x27; logistics and bases on our land. There are results. I am grateful to some of our partners – the weapons are effective, as we agreed. We have a result in our advancement, the result of our guys&#x27; assault operations, and this is the key news for our country. Every day, every week, Ukraine needs such results. Every day, every week, we need to keep the initiative. I am grateful to all those who are doing just that – every kilometer, every occupier&#x27;s defense line overcome – all this matters. The consistency of our results means the consistency of the world&#x27;s support for Ukraine. There was a report at the Staff meeting on the protection of the Black Sea coast and the Danube region. Protection of people. Protection of ports. Protection of our exports. I am grateful to everyone who works for this. We also discussed international politics and the changes that have taken place. Government officials reported, as did the intelligence. There are many challenges. But whatever the threats, our response is our strength. Our unity. To protect Ukraine and state interests, to be on the defensive or with the defense. To help. To take care of those around us. To find your place in the common work of the nation – this is important. We will definitely prevail! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our task remains unchanged – this year we must be ready to open negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the EU – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-17</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A report for this day. An eventful one. The Staff. Key war and foreign policy issues. A meeting with the Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate. A long one. On key risks. We are addressing every risk, every threat. Our response is powerful. Finance Minister Marchenko informed about meetings and negotiations with the heads of international financial institutions. The annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank have recently taken place. Their attention to Ukraine is important. And there is an important conclusion that many partners, different leaders and institutions have: global stability, global security, and the development of the global economy are directly linked to the fact that Russian aggression against Ukraine must end, end fairly – with the restoration of international order, with the full force of international law. Today, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has adopted the decision necessary to start negotiations with the European Union. The law on politically exposed persons has been adopted. I am waiting to sign the text of the law. Our task remains unchanged: to be ready to open negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the EU this year. We are doing the Ukrainian part of the job for this and we will complete it. We expect a political decision to start negotiations from the leaders of the EU countries. I held a final meeting on the work of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Ukraine this year. This is an important and effective platform for direct communication with communities and addressing pressing issues in the regions, interaction of local authorities with all central government agencies, the government, and the Verkhovna Rada. I am grateful to everyone who is actively working within the Congress. In particular, with regard to the restoration and preparation for winter. But, of course, the work of the Congress should be expanded to cover a wider range of issues, including social issues, communications, job creation, and many, many other things that are important to people across the country. And the front. The warriors. Our brigades. The 54th separate mechanized brigade, the 68th separate jaeger brigade, the 25th separate airborne brigade – this is the Lyman direction. And the Soledar direction: the 92nd separate assault brigade and the 93rd Kholodnyi Yar separate mechanized brigade. Thank you, warriors! Thank you to everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is helping us! And today I am especially grateful to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. And they are being implemented very accurately – ATACMS have proven themselves. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Minister of Defense presented a program of action; first steps have already been taken to resolve issues raised by the military – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-18</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! In Zaporizhzhia, rescue operations have been ongoing all day at the scene of a Russian missile hit. Part of an ordinary residential building was destroyed – floors three through five in one of the blocks. As of now, five people have been reported dead. My condolences to the families and friends. Another five people were injured and are being provided with the necessary assistance. I am grateful to everyone who is working on the ground and supporting people: the State Emergency Service, medical workers, our police, and utilities. And I thank all our warriors who are striking back at the occupier and thus bringing justice to Ukraine. This is the foundation of our state&#x27;s existence – to destroy the enemy and thus protect people. The more successful our warriors are, the more progress is made at the front, the more significant losses Russian troops suffer, the sooner we will be able to return security to all our cities and villages. To every community – from Sumy to Zaporizhzhia region, from Orikhiv to every other city in our country. Today I had important phone calls with the Prime Minister of Norway and the President of France. In particular, we discussed the situation on the battlefield, support for our troops, defense cooperation, and the work of grain corridors in the Black Sea. This is important not only for our country, but also for the whole world, for global stability. Special attention, of course, is paid to enhancing air defense and our long-range capabilities, our strength at sea. We also discussed with the Prime Minister of Norway the start of the work on security guarantees on the basis of the relevant declaration of the G7. I invited Norway to take part in the next meeting on the Peace Formula. With the President of France, we discussed further cooperation at the EU level – both political work to open membership negotiations and macro-financial assistance for Ukraine. Invited both Norway and France to participate in our summit on food security and the &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; humanitarian initiative to be held next month. It is important that our assessments of the situation in the Middle East coincide. I discussed this with both Emmanuel and Mr. Prime Minister of Norway. It is a matter of principle to prevent any further escalation in the Middle East and to save as many lives as possible. All parties must take care of civilians – women and children caught in the middle of the hostilities and shelling. It will be one of the worst scenarios if the number of victims keeps increasing. And it is necessary to prevent such a scenario. I met with a delegation of the Romanian government. Today, a joint meeting of the governments of our countries took place. This is another important step towards the strategic partnership between Ukraine and Romania. Our cooperation, our formats of interaction are a new force for the entire Black Sea region. For security, for economic development, for the construction of new infrastructure. And I am grateful to our Romanian partners for the real substance of our joint work. And one more important thing for today. I held a meeting with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine – he presented his team and his program. The Ministry&#x27;s team has been renewed. There are already first steps to address the issues raised by the military. Reducing bureaucracy, simplifying paperwork, all procedures, freeing up commanders&#x27; time for combat work instead of paperwork. There will be more digitalization and clarity in supplying the troops. There should be more readiness for feedback from the military and overcoming piled up problems. I thank everyone in the state system who works for the interests of Ukraine to ensure that the result is seen every day. Every day means more strength for Ukraine. Glory to all who defend our country! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I am grateful to the United States for leadership that helps unite the world in protecting lives – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-19</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I have just finished a call with U.S. President Biden. As always, a meaningful conversation – a conversation of allies. A strong signal of support – as much as needed for the victory. I am grateful to President Biden, to the Congress – both parties – and to the American people for their strong support and leadership – leadership that helps unite the world to protect lives and the rules-based international order. Ukrainians know how important strong unity is in defending against terror, against aggression. Unity here in our country. Unity in partner countries, particularly in America. Unity of the world. We discussed further joint steps in the defense of freedom. We discussed defense support, including the fact that ATACMS can help us speed up the liberation of Ukraine from the occupier. Of course, we also talked about preserving assistance to Ukraine next year – about a significant support package for our country. America will support the implementation of the Peace Formula, and I have informed President Biden of the next major international meeting on the Peace Formula, which will take place in Malta this month. I asked President Biden about his visit to the Middle East and his view of the further developments. We share the same view that it is necessary to avoid further destabilization and incitement of war in this region of the world as well. Ukrainians and Americans, we sympathize with all the victims of the tragic events. Ukraine is ready to work together with America and all partners to stabilize the situation and save as many lives as possible. Today I also spoke with UN Secretary-General Guterres. We talked about how the UN institutions can help our country and our people during the winter period. We also talked about food security – about the routes of food exports from Ukraine in the Black Sea, about the need to protect Ukrainian ports from Russian terrorist attacks. I invited Mr. Secretary-General to the food summit – the summit of our humanitarian initiative &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot;, which will be held in November. I also praised the UN&#x27;s active participation in the global efforts on the Peace Formula and readiness to send a UN representative to the next meeting in the format of advisors. Of course, we also discussed the situation in Israel, Palestine, and the Middle East in general. The whole world must be consolidated so that peace reigns in every region of the world – everywhere on earth. And no matter what happens, all parties must ensure that ordinary civilians receive the necessary assistance and are able to flee hostilities. Any form of terror and warmongering is unacceptable. One more thing. I started this day with a working trip to Kyiv region – those towns and villages affected by the Russian occupation. I am grateful to everyone who is working to restore everything that was destroyed by the occupier. Ukraine is not left alone – we are being helped by governments of different countries and philanthropists. Of course, a lot needs to be done – a lot needs to be rebuilt, restored, so that not a single ruin is left in Ukraine. But all this work is based on one thing – the sincerity of the hearts of the people who are with us, who value life, freedom and courage as much as we do in Ukraine. I believe that such people are the majority in the world. And we must continue to do everything possible and impossible to ensure that the majority of the world stands with Ukraine. Glory to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine, for freedom! Thank you to everyone who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>These days, Russian losses are really impressive, and it is exactly the kind of losses of the occupier that Ukraine needs – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-20</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today my team and I are in Kherson region, in Mykolaiv. There are a lot of tasks. A meeting with the military – Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, Chief of the General Staff Shaptala, Commander of the Odesa operational-strategic grouping of troops Hnatov and Commander of the Marines Sodol, Head of the State Border Guard Service, General Deyneko. A special format, a narrow circle. Regarding the situation in Kherson and the region, in the south in general, as well as in Donetsk region – first of all, Avdiivka. I am grateful to all our guys who are holding their ground and destroying the occupier day after day. These days, Russian losses are really impressive, and it is exactly the kind of losses of the occupier that Ukraine needs. We also discussed the Kupyansk direction in Kharkiv region. I held a meeting in Mykolaiv with the leadership of the region and the city, the military, the law enforcers to discuss the protection of the region, our infrastructure, our ports, corridors in the Black Sea. We also analyzed social issues that are important for Mykolaiv and the cities and villages of the region: energy, heat supply, water supply to Mykolaiv and the region, the quality of water supplied to the city, social services, economic activity. All the things that really need attention at all levels of government. I am especially grateful to Denmark for their effective support of Mykolaiv, for their sincere assistance to the city, just as we agreed with Prime Minister Frederiksen. I visited our warriors in Mykolaiv hospital who are undergoing treatment after being wounded in battles. I thanked them for their strength and thanked the doctors for their dedication to their work. An important report by the regional head of the Security Service of Ukraine on the protection of Mykolaiv and the region from subversive activities of Russia and collaborators. Thank you for your work, guys! Special attention is paid to protecting the sky from Russian bombs and missiles. We are working to bolster air defense. I thank everyone in the world who helps us with this. In particular, I spoke with Olaf Scholz – regarding air defense as well. We are working together to ensure that Patriots in the hands of Ukrainian warriors can do more – already this winter. I invited Germany to take part in a meeting of advisors on the Peace Formula, which we are preparing for late October. We also discussed the situation in the Middle East with the Chancellor. I thank Olaf that our agreements are being strictly implemented. President Biden delivered a very important, indeed historic speech. Yesterday we spoke with him – it was a good conversation, and now there is his address – powerful, timely, one that really adds to our confidence. Thank you for your unwavering support for Ukraine. The democratic world understands how important Ukraine&#x27;s resilience is for the freedom of all free nations – and not only in Europe. We can overcome all threats. The speech by President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen the day before is also inspiring. I am grateful to Madam President for her clear call to speed up Ukraine&#x27;s path to victory. A call to everyone in Europe and the free world to be as united as possible, as long as it takes to defeat the terrorists who seek to destroy our states and our lives. Europe must prevail, not those who are trying to turn our lives into ruins. And one more thing. Today is the 20th anniversary of the intelligence of the Border Guard Service of Ukraine. They are heroic warriors. I had the honor to congratulate them today, to recognize them with state awards. I held a separate meeting with the border guards on the tasks they perform – they perform them effectively. And I am proud that the Border Guard Service of Ukraine and its units are only getting stronger. Glory to all of you, warriors! Glory to our strong nation! And thank you – Kherson, Mykolaiv – for today. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our warriors have made this week very significant for Ukraine – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-21</span></div>
  <p>I wish good health to all Ukrainians, both men and women! Our active international work doesn&#x27;t stop for a single day. Today, I spoke with President Erdoğan of Türkiye, and this marks the ninth international conversation this week. I have already talked to the President of Finland, the Prime Minister of Canada, the President of South Africa, the Prime Minister of Norway, as well as the President of France, the UN Secretary-General, the President of the United States, the Chancellor of Germany. The main goal in all these discussions is to protect lives and people, peaceful people, and prevent destabilization from spreading to other regions of the world, not let our work in consolidating the global majority for international law go to waste. I am grateful to all the leaders for their support and understanding that it&#x27;s time for maximum joint efforts. With President Erdoğan, we discussed the situation in our Black Sea region, aggression against Ukraine, aggression against global security, and the situation in the Middle East. It is very important to protect peaceful people, it is very important to prevent the escalation of new large-scale humanitarian crises, and important to work together to quickly restore the full force of international law. We are actively preparing for a new Peace Formula meeting, which is scheduled for next week and will take place in Malta. Significant world powers will be represented, and the list of participants is growing practically every day. We expect over 50 participants. Today, President Erdoğan confirmed that Türkiye will participate in the meeting. We are also getting ready for a new summit of our Crimea Platform, at the parliamentary level. The number of participants is substantial. The summit will be held in the Czech Republic. I am grateful to everyone around the world who has joined and is ready to work with us at the parliamentary diplomacy level for the sake of security and peace throughout Europe, without any exceptions for any parts of our continent. A very significant step by President Biden this week – I am sincerely grateful for it. A new package of long-lasting and reliable support for Ukraine has been prepared – defense and economic – for our protection of people and freedom. I am thankful for this initiative by President Biden, and I believe that not only Ukrainians but all nations, all free nations in Europe, are expecting the preservation of American unity with our defense. American leadership is needed for the world, and I am grateful to both parties in Congress who understand this and support, in particular, our people&#x27;s struggle for independence. And, of course, our warriors. Thank you to each and every one who is currently fighting, in combat positions, and at their posts! Avdiyivka direction, Maryinka. Bahmut direction. Kupiansk, Lyman directions. Our Zaporizhia. Our Kherson region. On the frontlines and deep within the occupied territory, our warriors have made this week very significant for Ukraine. Now, I want to express my gratitude to all our defense and security forces – absolutely all of you! Every unit, every warrior, every commander who has achieved the necessary combat results for our state during this week. Glory to you, warriors! Glory to our entire nation! I thank everyone around the world who is helping! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine will not break – it will endure and drive out the Russian evil from its land – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, First and foremost, I want to dwell on the Russian attack on the Nova Poshta terminal near Kharkiv. The rescue operation has been completed, and necessary assistance has been provided to all the affected. In total, there were 17 of them. Six people were killed in this attack. My deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the deceased! We will undoubtedly respond to Russia for every manifestation of its terror, including this attack. Terrorists will not break the Ukrainian will to defend and protect own state, own independence by any means. The readiness of our people to work for their country, for their Ukraine. The determination to fight so that there is never any real basis for Moscow to hope that Ukraine will ever break. It will not break. It will endure. It will hold up. And despite everything, it will drive out the Russian evil from own land. The main focus is the front, our defense, our actions, our results, and the support of everyone to those who are currently in the battle, on the combat posts, in the positions. Every day, we need results for Ukraine – to withstand Russian assaults, to eliminate occupiers, and to move forward. Whether it&#x27;s by a kilometer or 500 meters, but forward every day, to improve Ukrainian positions, to press the occupiers. This strengthens our state. It motivates the entire world to help us. And it proves that Russia&#x27;s terror does not work. Today, I want to mention our warriors who have distinguished themselves during these weeks. The warriors who have provided exceptional assistance to Ukraine, on different fronts and in different tasks, but equally powerfully and effectively. Kupiansk direction, Kharkiv region. The warriors of our strong 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade and the 1st Mechanized Battalion of the 67th Separate Mechanized Brigade – I thank you! You&#x27;ve done an excellent job! Avdiyivka and Maryinka directions, particularly intense. Numerous Russian attacks. But our positions are defended. The 53rd and 110th Separate Mechanized Brigades, the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, and the 79th Airborne Assault Brigade – I thank all of you, warriors, for a truly exemplary defense. It instills confidence throughout the country. And each time, it&#x27;s an honor for me to thank the warriors of the 55th Separate Artillery Brigade, which actively and effectively supports all our guys in defending Donetsk. Lyman direction – thank you for thwarting the occupier&#x27;s plans. Our 68th Separate Hunting Brigade and units of the renowned 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade – well done, guys! Bakhmut direction – both defense and our offensives, and our results are very, very good. I thank the warriors of the 92nd Separate Assault Brigade and the 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade. Thank you for your strength, guys! Among all directions in the south, I want to particularly acknowledge the paratroopers of the 46th Airmobile Brigade – Melitopol direction. Thank you, guys, for truly helping the entire front with your results. And the next week will bring more opportunities for Ukraine – for our defense, for our protection against Russian terror, for our Peace Formula, which continues to unite the world. Today, I spoke with the Emir of Qatar and thanked him, among other things, for the readiness to participate in the next Peace Formula meeting, as well as for the unwavering support for our territorial integrity and sovereignty. We also discussed Qatar&#x27;s mediation in the release of deported and captured Ukrainians. I thank everyone in the world who is helping Ukraine! I also thank everyone in our country who uses each day to make us all, the entire Ukrainian people, stronger! Glory to all of you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world&#x27;s attention to Ukraine, to defending freedom and international law must be upheld – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-23</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! A brief report for the day. I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff. The matter, in fact, is only one – the situation in all our fronts. The front in Avdiyivka... I&#x27;m especially grateful to the warriors on this front! Resilience there is a strength for all of Ukraine right now. Maryinka, other directions in Donetsk region. Lyman. Kupiansk. Thank you, warriors! Separately – the south. Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson and the region, Odesa... Of course, our state border – east, north. Strengthening the border. Supply of ammunition to the frontline, including our own supply, Ukrainian production. I thank all enterprises, all workers who contribute to Ukraine&#x27;s results – a constant increase in our arms and ammunition production. I held a meeting regarding the international events and negotiations being prepared by our state for the near future. Tomorrow, in particular, the Crimea Platform, its parliamentary dimension. The world&#x27;s attention to Ukraine, to defending freedom and international law, must be upheld – we will do everything for this. I spoke with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia – a meaningful conversation. Our bilateral relations and relations with the Gulf. The Peace Formula – I invited Saudi Arabia to participate in a meeting in Malta that is being prepared, and I thanked for the significant role in bringing the Global Peace Summit closer. Of course, we discussed the situation in the Middle East. The main thing is to save as many civilian lives as possible and prevent both a humanitarian catastrophe and the escalation of a wider war. One more thing. I want to particularly honor our National Guard warriors today. Those whose courage deserves to be known by all Ukrainians. The 4th Operational Brigade. Soldier Andriy Martynenko and Senior Soldier Anatoliy Trokhymenko. The 5th Separate Slobozhanska Brigade. Junior Sergeant Yuriy Posternak and Lieutenant Daniil Lohvynenko. The 12th Special Purpose Brigade. Soldier Yehor Hriadovkin and Junior Sergeant Rostyslav Romanovsky. The 14th Operational Brigade. Senior Soldier Orest Kuznetsov and Junior Sergeant Serhiy Matviychuk. Thank you, guys, and all your comrades! Glory to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine, for our people, for our freedom! Thanks to everyone in the world who is helping! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>If we can get rid of grey geopolitical zones, we must do it – speech of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the meeting of the College of the European Commission</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-24</span></div>
  <p>Ursula, Madam President! Dear European Commissioners! I am glad to see you, thanks for your words, for your support, Ursula. This is a special moment for us. For Ukraine and for the whole Europe. Special not only because of the circumstances that Russia has created against us with its anti-European aggression. It is special because of what we can do… What we can do and are doing. We, all of us, we Europeans. For the sake of greater security and stability across our continent, in our countries, in our homes. The time since the collapse of the so-called “Eastern Bloc” has shown that the greatest threat to life in Europe is the lack of geopolitical certainty. This deficit, like a magnet, attracted crises and tempted enemies of the European way to fight against European unity. Because if there is even the smallest grey geopolitical zone – claims to dominate this zone will inevitably arise. And various political forces will try to paint this grey zone in their own political colours. For decades, Europe has remained divided into a territory where our common values are protected by European institutions, and – a territory outside the institutions, but although with the same values. Now – at last – we are a few geopolitical steps-away from eliminating this division. And this is our historic chance, of the whole Europe, – to remove the lack of geopolitical certainty, this source of crises and problems… All free nations in Europe now clearly see the prospect for themselves – all the states in the Balkans, and in the center and east Europe. Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. And Belarus... We see that the old grey geopolitical zones will inevitably be replaced by a new power of the European Union. This is one of the main outcomes of our unity. The EU – designed as a continental project, as a guarantor of good neighbourliness between the nations of Europe – is acquiring a well-deserved continental dimension. It is not a club for the elite, but a home indeed for all European nations who share common values. And the borders of the European Union will be the borders of the continent of Europe – no grey zones! Our political generation is capable of ensuring this, and I am sure we will not miss this special moment. Ladies and gentlemen! Ukrainian faith in the EU has always been one of the strongest on the continent. Ukrainians have been and remain optimistic about the European Union. And our optimism is proved by how strongly the EU stands by its values and helps us defend our freedom and independence. I am grateful to all of you – both as representatives of the EU and all the EU member states – for all the support provided to Ukraine! Defense, sanctions, humanitarian and financial support. And I would like to emphasize the long-term support programs – in particular, the European Commission’s initiative to create a Financial Instrument for Ukraine. We welcome its approval by the European Parliament on October 17th and expect that this instrument will be finalized by the end of the year so that funding can be launched in January. And I would like to note the experience of Belgium for the first strong step in Europe regarding the use of frozen Russian assets to compensate for the damage caused by Russia’s aggression. It would be fair – if such a decision was scaled-up to the level of the entire continent. And the next steps should be taken including the confiscation of the aggressor’s assets. This should be Europe’s rule for the world – the aggressor pays the highest price for violating peace. It is very important to continue to make sanctions pressure on Russia for its aggression effective. The way the free world’s sanctions are working now is a model for how we can put pressure on other disruptors of peace. Every sanction imposed must be one hundred percent effective. The same applies to pressure on intermediaries who help Russia circumvent the sanctions regime. And now, before the winter, we are actively working with all partners to strengthen our air defense to protect Ukraine – our cities, our people – from Russian terror. The strength of our air shield is a guarantee in particular for our neighbors that Russian terror will not cross the EU’s borders. And I thank all countries and leaders who support us in strengthening our air defense. And, of course, the key political thing is that we want no trace of the grey geopolitical zone to remain. Ukraine has been implementing the seven recommendations of the European Commission as quickly as possible to enable a political decision to open accession negotiations already this year. We have done a lot, and I would say – much more than could be expected from a country that has been subjected to full-scale aggression. But Ukraine is not asking for political discounts – we demonstrate the necessary political pace. We share the approach that decisions should be based on the individual achievements of countries that seek to become members of the European Union. The first is our reform of constitutional justice. We have adopted and started implementing the law on the selection of judges of the Constitutional Court, which is in line with the conclusions of the Venice Commission. We already have a group of experts who will evaluate the candidates – three experts were appointed based on proposals from our international partners as a guarantee of transparency and fairness in the selection of judges. And we are launching the competition. The second is the reform of the High Council of Justice and the High Qualification Commission of Judges. The reboot of these key bodies launched the process of renewing the entire judicial system of Ukraine. The third is anti-corruption work. A law was adopted to restore e-declarations of officials and their verification during martial law. The e-declarations must be public. The state anti-corruption program has been approved. And we are strengthening the existing anti-corruption architecture. The fourth – we are ensuring that our legislation complies with the FATF requirements. The adoption of the law on politically exposed persons is an extremely important step. The fifth – we continue to work on protecting society and the state from misuse instigated by oligarchs. Also important antitrust legislation has been adopted. And the sixth – Ukrainian media legislation has been brought in line with EU standards. And the seventh – we are affirming the protection of diversity in Ukraine through the protection of the rights of national communities. Respective legislative changes have already been adopted, including the law on national minorities. A clear vision of the next steps in the educational sector has been developed as well. There is also a state target program called Unity in Diversity. All of this opens-up new and broader opportunities for national communities. Together with community representatives, we will ensure compliance with the highest international standards in this area. For Ukraine, this is a top priority – to be ready for a political decision to start negotiations on EU membership this year. And I hope it is the same for the European Union. We have laid a solid basis for this. The goal now is very special. If we can get rid of grey geopolitical zones, we must do it! Europe needs the European Union. And let Ukrainian optimism about the EU serve a more stable future for the whole Europe! Thank you very much for your attention! Thanks for your support! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>President at the Crimea Platform Summit: Our goal is the complete de-occupation of our land, including Crimea; we must implement it</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-24</span></div>
  <p>Madam Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic! Mr. President of the Senate of the Czech Republic! Mr. Prime Minister of the Czech Republic! Mr. Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada! Dear friends! First of all, I would like to thank the Czech Republic, its leaders, and the entire Czech society for supporting Ukraine and for hosting this Summit. I welcome all of you – the participants of the Crimea Platform Summit, its parliamentary dimension, which makes our Crimea Platform exceptionally strong by adding the energy of the democratic world. This is what fundamentally sets us apart from Russia. Russia&#x27;s calculations have always been based not on people or unity but on bribery or violence. We, on the other hand, do things differently. We unite the world, we unite people. We believe in the ability of every individual to rise above, not above their neighbors but above circumstances. No matter how terrifying and hopeless circumstances may seem, it is in the human character to find and detect ways to protect life. The more united we are, the faster we will end Russian aggression with a reliable and just peace. We are moving towards achieving our goal more actively than ever, for nearly a decade of Russian hybrid and then full-scale aggression. It is in the Black Sea region, specifically in the situation surrounding Crimea, where the effectiveness of our tactics is working best. Ladies and gentlemen, I will be candid: for many in the world, Crimea seemed like an argument that full de-occupation of our territory was supposedly unattainable. Russian control of the Black Sea and the presence of the occupier&#x27;s fleet created an illusion that Russia&#x27;s dominance in the Black Sea was insurmountable. In addition to this, the deliberate settlement of Crimea with hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens and the extensive repression by the occupier against all forms of freedom and resistance could create the impression that Crimea was subdued. Now, the illusions are fading away. Let me remind you of our achievements. First, the Russian military fleet is no longer able to operate in the western part of the Black Sea and is gradually retreating from Crimea. This is a historic achievement. Recently, the Russian leadership was forced to announce the creation of a new base for the Black Sea Fleet – or what&#x27;s left of it – on the occupied territory of Georgia, in the southeastern part of the sea, as far as possible from Ukrainian missiles and naval drones. But we will reach them everywhere. Second, there are no longer any safe bases or entirely reliable logistical routes for Russian terrorists in Crimea and the occupied parts of the Black Sea and Azov coast. As of now, we have not yet achieved full fire control over Crimea and its adjacent waters. But we will. It&#x27;s just a matter of time. Third, we observe that pro-Ukrainian sentiments in Crimea are becoming more open, even though Russia still controls this land. Just as in all other occupied areas of Ukraine, the people in Crimea realize that Russia will leave, and they are waiting for Ukraine. Russia&#x27;s weakness is becoming louder than the fear of the occupied people, and we clearly see that in Crimea, we have many allies. Fourth, Ukraine has been able to restore the Black Sea to its role as a secure artery critical to global food stability. Without our agricultural exports, the price crisis in the food market and social chaos become a threat to dozens of different nations from the western coast of Africa to Bangladesh, to Indonesia. This is a cornerstone: when Ukrainian food exports disappear, the entire global food market is disrupted. Initially, together with the UN and Türkiye, we launched the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Later, we added the humanitarian initiative &quot;Grain from Ukraine.&quot; When Russia decided to destroy this architecture of food security, we launched new temporary export routes from our seaports in addition to our exports through the Danube port region and the Solidarity Lanes by land. Since the start of the new export corridor in the Black Sea, nearly 50 vessels have loaded, and more than 50 are expected to arrive soon. Finally, the fifth point concerns value. It&#x27;s something worth reminding ourselves of today, on the United Nations Day, when 78 years ago, the UN Charter came into effect. It&#x27;s the most important international document that essentially affirms the basic right of every nation – the right to life without aggression, annexations, or terror. Once, at the beginning of Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine, many were willing to turn a blind eye to Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea, thinking it would appease the aggressor. However, it had the opposite effect; it only fueled its ambitions because it added to its belief in impunity. We are dismantling Russia&#x27;s impunity step by step. This is also thanks to our work in the UN, despite Russia&#x27;s abuse of its veto power. It&#x27;s thanks to our Peace Formula, which is based on the principles and goals of the UN Charter and is gradually becoming a global Formula. International legal institutions, such as the International Criminal Court, contribute to this, as it issued an arrest warrant for Putin in the case of the abduction and deportation of children. Sanctions against Russia play a role, too. And the principled support from various countries, various leaders for our state and the courage of our people are crucial. Our current task is to maintain and increase pressure on the occupier. My simple call to you is: don&#x27;t stop halfway. Clearing the Black Sea of terrorist fleets is challenging. However, it&#x27;s significantly easier to cleanse the information environment from Russian propaganda, which still attempts to distort our achievements got through our cooperation and undermine the democratic order. We must stop Russian propaganda. This will help us and preserve the souls of your people and your societies. Just as we are destroying the occupier&#x27;s logistics in our country, we must deprive logistics of bypassing sanctions against Russia through any intermediaries – be it states, companies, or individuals – of being safe. Sanctions must work, and I call upon you to exercise parliamentary control over the relevant sanction regimes. The next point is motivation, and this is also a weapon. It needs to be charged. I&#x27;m grateful to all the countries truly willing to support Ukraine to the extent necessary for victory. Our people must see such readiness so that their willingness to fight against occupiers remains at its maximum. Ultimately, the long-term security of all of Europe depends on this: Russia&#x27;s defeat is your security, the security of every nation accustomed to its freedom and relying on the fact that the world is not a place for aggressors. Fourth, we all must work together to prevent new crises in the world, including food, energy, or migration crises, and to ensure that existing conflicts do not spread to other regions. From this perspective, violence erupted in the Middle East is a big risk. Everyone sees the forces that could be engulfed by such violence, and everyone sees the importance of avoiding it. It can be avoided! I urge you to support the efforts of all leaders to save the lives of civilians, no matter where they live, and to stabilize the entire region. Without stability there, it will be much more challenging to achieve a return of peace in Europe. To close the path to ruins in the Middle East, we still need to open the path to the release of hostages. And one more thing, particularly sensitive regarding Crimea. At this Crimea Platform Summit, representatives of the Crimean Tatar people – the indigenous people – are participating, as they always have. I urge you to hear the pain of these people, a people who have been forcibly displaced from their homeland several times. A people who endured deportation by Moscow and have been living in captivity under the occupiers for nearly a decade. Russia&#x27;s attempts to control Crimea are not just about land or a military foothold that Moscow needed in the Black Sea to destabilize neighboring regions. It&#x27;s about the people who need to be saved from all forms of repression. It&#x27;s about political prisoners who need to be freed from Russian prisons – women, men, young and old... Diverse. It&#x27;s about families who deserve protection. It&#x27;s about culture that has the right to its own home, free from occupiers, just like any other human culture. Please remember these people. None of them deserve to have their fates &quot;frozen.&quot; That&#x27;s why our goal is complete de-occupation of our land, including Crimea. We must implement it. I thank all of you for your attention, for this summit! Once again, thank you for your participation, for your engagement. Together, we are moving closer to a just peace! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>A crystal-clear signal is needed for Russia – Germany, by working with Ukraine, believes in peace – speech of the Head of State at the 6th German-Ukrainian Economic Forum &quot;Recovery, Smart Growth and Security&quot;</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-24</span></div>
  <p>Dear Olaf, Mr. Chancellor! Dear Denys, Mr. Prime Minister! Dear representatives of governments, representatives of businesses from our countries! Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for another display of Ukrainian-German unity. During this war, Ukrainian courage has become a global brand. Most people in the world know Ukraine precisely because of it – our bravery. Similarly, German reliability is a global brand. Germany is known and appreciated for it. I have, by the way, been convinced of this multiple times – you are indeed a reliable state and a reliable partner. I am thankful for your strong support for Ukraine, for our people. I am thankful to the entire German nation, and I am thankful to you personally, Olaf. Thank you for the assistance that Ukrainians have received for their defense. Reliable assistance! Now, by working together, we can combine the best qualities of our nations and jointly – Ukraine and Germany – offer a chance for our Europe to grow. More security. More development. More job opportunities. More possibilities for ordinary families who work to lead a decent life. And more strength for our continent. I am confident that Ukraine&#x27;s potential is well known to all of you. Specific projects and programs in various sectors will be presented by the Ukrainian government team and the top managers of Ukrainian companies participating in the forum. I would like to draw your attention, first and foremost, to the defense sector in Ukraine – our production of weapons, equipment, and ammunition, which we are boosting. This is our number one production priority, and some German companies have already started substantial cooperation with us in this field. We invite all others to join. Ukrainian energy, our infrastructure, agriculture, and reconstruction deserve no less attention – areas that currently, during the war, especially require international cooperation. And these areas will yield special returns for every company that starts working both in and with Ukraine, right now while others are only analyzing the prospects. I want to make a few security points today. The first one is about air defense. We are building special relations with the most powerful countries in the world to provide our cities with a reliable air shield against Russian terror. Among these countries, of course, is Germany. Additionally, we are working on agreements with partners for joint production of air defense systems. This is a strategic task, and I have no doubt that we can accomplish it. However, it takes time. Therefore, during this winter and the next year, we need our partners to continue supporting our air shield. I am grateful, especially to Germany, for understanding this need. Economic development in the conditions of the neighborhood that Ukraine has is a direct reflection of how well we can protect our skies. This is also a significant argument for our people who are currently in European countries seeking refuge. They will return home when the threat of Russian terror diminishes. The second point is about war risk insurance. We are appealing to the governments of partner countries, including the government of Germany, to collaborate with businesses from our countries and establish a reliable mechanism for insuring against war risks. It&#x27;s evident that such risks deter investments and that having a protection system against them will be a significant step in deterring Russian aggression. The Kremlin still hopes for world weariness with support for Ukraine. Politically, we ensure that such weariness won&#x27;t happen, no matter how hard Russia tries to provoke it. Economically, our cooperation with you can help achieve this. The third point is reevaluating our region and, to a large extent, Europe. Russia is losing ground in economic relations with Europe, which have been built over more than 50 years. This applies to many sectors which Russian companies have already left or will leave. European business and the potential of our countries and European neighbors will replace them – this is inevitable. The rebuilding of Ukraine after the armed conflict, the growth of new globally important export centers like the Danube region, our new relationships in Eastern Europe, particularly strategic relations with Romania, and partnerships with Moldova and Türkiye, the emergence of industries in Ukraine such as the production and operation of combat drones, including the creation of a fleet of maritime drones, the rethinking of our energy sector with a focus on decentralized green energy... All of this and more is clear potential for cooperation and growth. I&#x27;ll give just one example that is known worldwide – German machinery. This is the best foundation for any economy. It&#x27;s crucial to launch the flow of German machinery into Ukraine as the basis for Ukrainian industries, in particular, through full-fledged export credit financing. Is there anything unrealistic in what I&#x27;ve said? I believe not. Is it all economically beneficial? Yes. Most importantly, in this case, the economy provides more security. And a crystal-clear signal is needed for Russia, as it always pays attention to Germany. With whom Germany works. In whom Germany believes as partners. With whom it shares its reliability and takes something for itself to become stronger. These are all fundamental things. Let those who initiated this terrible war see that Germany, by working with Ukraine, believes in peace. And peace is approaching as we grow stronger together. I thank all of you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are using all means to ensure that this war ends with the defeat of the occupiers – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-24</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! Today is a busy day with a lot of international work. The next summit of the Crimea Platform, its parliamentary dimension, has taken place. The first such summit was held last year in Croatia, and now the second one is in the Czech Republic. I am grateful to our Czech partners for their help in organizing the summit. The powerful summit declaration is about supporting Ukraine, our territorial integrity and sovereignty, the need to liberate all our land from the occupier, and all our people from Russian captivity. Support of our Peace Formula. A clear voice in support of increased pressure on Russia and the exact assistance that Ukraine needs to win this war. I&#x27;m thankful to Ruslan Stefanchuk and the entire team of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and the involved public institutions for brilliantly holding the summit. This time, almost 70 parliamentary delegations from different countries around the world. High-quality statements. The unwavering attention of the democratic world to Ukraine, our defense. I addressed the summit participants and outlined our tactics regarding the Black Sea region and Crimea. Despite many doubts from various international actors, Ukraine has shown that it can prevail, despite all the challenges, especially in the Black Sea region. This is indeed a historic achievement when the Russian fleet retreats not only from the western part of the sea but even from Crimea. However, this will make no sense to the occupiers. And I want to say separately to all our people in Crimea, in Sevastopol, in all the occupied areas of the South and East of our state, in the currently occupied areas. Dear Ukrainians! All of you feel that the Russian presence on our land is not permanent. I know this. Ukraine will reclaim its territory and its people. We will not leave anyone to the occupiers. We are using every means to ensure that this war ends with the defeat of the occupiers. Today, I also participated in the meeting of the College of EU Commissioners, a significant EU institution led by President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Step by step, we are moving towards a historic milestone in our relationship with Europe – we are working to open negotiations for Ukraine&#x27;s EU membership already this year. There are significant legislative innovations and necessary steps in building institutions. In addition to the obvious historical importance for us as a state, the start of negotiations with the EU on membership will also have a substantial practical effect here and now, for all our people and our warriors. Motivation is also a weapon, and it needs to be recharged. We expect this powerful boost for Ukrainian motivation – the readiness on the part of the EU to begin negotiations with Ukraine, the corresponding political decision. I thank all the partners who are working with us to bring this closer. A few more things. Today, another Ukrainian-German business forum has started in Germany. The key is that our defense industry, energy, and infrastructure are presented at the forum. There are good agreements and joint projects. I am grateful to Chancellor Olaf Scholz personally, his government team, and all of German society. Our level of relations and trust between Ukraine and Germany is indeed the highest in all the years of our independence. We are preparing another significant international meeting regarding the Ukrainian Peace Formula at the level of advisors and special representatives. It has been almost a year since the points of the Peace Formula were presented. Much has been accomplished in this year, and our Peace Formula is gradually becoming global. Currently, the Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working on expanding the circle of participants in the meeting, and we already understand that representatives from all continents will be present. I want to thank everyone in the world who is helping Ukraine get closer to a just peace! Today, I want to specifically acknowledge Denmark. I met with the Danish Minister of Defence. We discussed our further cooperation – the preparation of a new defense support package. Every day, every week, we use to make our country stronger. Glory to Ukrainian warriors! Glory to our entire nation! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every Russian strike is an argument that pressure on the terrorist state is insufficient – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-25</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, Report for this day. Khmelnytsky region, the city of Slavuta. The assessment of the damage caused by the explosion of Russian drones last night is ongoing. The Shaheds were shot down, but many buildings have sustained damage – shattered windows, doors, roofs of the buildings. It is highly likely that the target for these drones was the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant – the shockwave from the explosion shattered windows, including those on the territory of the NPP. As of now, it is known that around twenty local residents have been injured. All necessary assistance has been provided to them. This strike towards the NPP is another reminder to all our partners of how important it is to strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s air defense and how dangerous it can be when Russia can bypass international sanctions. Many components in the attack drones used by Russian terrorists, as well as in their missiles, originate from various countries, various companies, including Western ones. The effectiveness of sanctions against Russia is literally a defense against terrorism. Tomorrow, I have the European Council meeting in my schedule, at the level of EU leaders. Among other topics, I will specifically discuss this: sanctions against Russia need to be expanded and strengthened. Every Russian strike, especially ones as audacious as those targeting nuclear plants and other critical facilities, is an argument that the pressure on the terrorist state is insufficient. Today, there was an important video conference – involving the military, intelligence, and government officials. Among the notable points is the occupier&#x27;s reaction to the new capabilities of our warriors. After our troops struck the airfields in Berdiansk and Luhansk, we see that the occupiers are relocating their aviation further. Specifically, they are attempting to redeploy it from the territory of our Crimea. This is a good sign. First, the Russian fleet flees, and now Russian aviation is fleeing. The habit of running will be very useful for Russia. Because they will have to flee all our land. Without exceptions. And I thank everyone in the world who helps us become stronger and achieve greater goals. And I thank our warriors for their accuracy. I held a meeting with our international partners regarding key countries in the Global South and our relations with them. We continue to prepare for the Peace Formula meeting, working at all diplomatic levels. The substance of the meeting is essentially ready, and we are now fine-tuning the list of participants. It is very important that in the relevant negotiations, we see unwavering attention to Ukraine and the need to end this war – to end it justly and fairly. This attention exists on different continents. And I am grateful to all the countries that have already confirmed their participation and the level of their representation at the Peace Formula meeting. One more thing. Throughout the day, I was in contact with our commanders and those responsible for providing our defense and offensive operations. Ammunition, weapons, equipment. Domestic production. Supporting our warriors. We are preparing for the expansion of the geography of supplies to Ukraine from our partners. We will complete this marathon and achieve our victory. The key is to add strength to Ukraine, our state, and our people every day. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia needs to see that its ambitions as an invader will endure less than our ability to defend our freedom – address of the President of Ukraine to the participants of the meeting of the European Council at the level of the leaders of the EU states</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-26</span></div>
  <p>Charles, Mr. President! Dear colleagues! I am pleased to see you all. And just before our meeting, I have signed a very important law relating to the European integration – the law on politically exposed persons. This is one of the key laws adopted to fulfill the recommendations of the European Commission to open negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the EU. The law significantly strengthens the financial monitoring of public figures. And in any country, it is not easy for the political class to make such decisions. But now is the time when simple decisions cannot suffice… Because this is the time when each of our decisions determines whether we become stronger in protecting our lives. And this applies not only to Ukraine. In Ukraine, it is now very clear what is at stake. Life. Life is at stake – as we all value it… We all. We all do in Europe. There are different ideological approaches among us. Some are more liberal, some are more conservative. Some are more active in international affairs, and some perceive their role differently. This is Europe. A continent of different but equal people. And most importantly, equal in their perception of the basis of life, namely, that Europe is not a place for despising any nation and trying to erase any nation. It is not a place to bring up children in hatred so that they grow up to be murderers. We remember Europe&#x27;s past... A past in which millions of human lives were destroyed precisely because there was a lack of unity. The kind of unity that exists now. It was the past when someone alone decided and, unfortunately, had the power to decide whether a nation had the right to exist. It is our historical responsibility to prevent the past from ever returning. We must remember that Russia is not fighting now to stay in our Mariupol or Crimea, but to be able to come to Tartu or Gdansk if the Kremlin wants it. Many of you lived through this past. Russia is trying to change the borders of Ukraine not only to seize one or another of our regions, but also to change any borders that they do not like. And you saw this in the past. Russia’s attempts to prevent Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the EU or NATO are not just about our country, they are about much more, about being able to take away from the EU or NATO any nation that is already there, without even asking the will of that nation, but deciding everything for them. This is what the Kremlin is used to. This war is about deciding what Europe should be like. And it is up to us to decide, not the Kremlin. Dear colleagues! Ukraine is doing everything possible to end this war as soon as possible with our people, with our victory – in defense and in building institutions, in international affairs and in putting pressure on the aggressor… And I thank each of you who helps us fight. I thank you for each of the defense packages provided to our soldiers – for weapons and equipment, for shells, for air defense… Yesterday, be the way, our soldiers shot down Russian combat drones that were moving towards the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant… Again and again we see what we are dealing with – the evil that can attack even nuclear power plants… Air defense is for life. Thank you, thank you all who understand this and help Ukraine with the respective systems and missiles. Sustainable arms supplies for Ukraine mean sustainable security for the whole Europe – for each of our neighbors. And I am especially grateful for the new page in our defense cooperation – for the development of the military industry in Ukraine and together with Ukraine. Many European defense companies have joined us. And I invite all European defense companies to come to Ukraine and take our experience to multiply it. This is exactly the kind of cooperation that will make all of us stronger for generations. I am grateful for the sanctions pressure on Russia – each of the sanctions packages adopted is really needed. The key now is to ensure that all sanctions work to the fullest and that Russia cannot circumvent them... We see that this has become one of the Kremlin&#x27;s top priorities – to manipulate sanctions and to neutralize them. So, we should intensify our joint work against this – against all intermediaries that help Russia circumvent sanctions, particularly in Europe and other regions of the world. A new, twelfth package of EU sanctions is being discussed. We have to take into account the experience of all previous packages, and the power of the new EU sanctions step should be greater than the previous ones. Attention should also be paid to the applied “price cap” on Russian oil – it is obvious that it is not working as effectively as it was expected when it was introduced. It is necessary to reduce the &quot;price cap&quot; and strengthen the mechanisms for its enforcement. And I urge you to work on this together with our partners, with all of us and with our G7 and G20 partners. And I want to thank Belgium and other nations and leaders who are working to make Russia feel that cost of its brutal attacks. All the assets of the terrorist state and its associates in all available jurisdictions must be frozen and used to compensate for the damage caused by Russian terror. It is fair that the funds accumulated by the Russian regime for the sake of war should be used for peace. And it is an affirmation of the power of law – to use such funds in the interests of the victims of Russia&#x27;s violation of international law. And I am grateful for a very effective support instrument long-term programs, including budget support. Among the EU countries, we already have decisions on such programs from Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Lithuania and the European Commission. And, of course, outside of the EU, I thank Norway, Japan, and Switzerland for their long-term steps. A long-term step is also being considered in the United States... And in confrontations such as the one unleashed by Russia, the winner is the one who provides a long-term strategy. Russia needs to see that its ambitions as an invader will endure less than our ability to defend our freedom. That is why every approved program of such long-term support for Ukraine is a clear signal to Russia that its aggression is in vain, and that no matter how many resources Putin spends in the war, he will not win. The Russian elite needs to see and feel this, so that it will be more difficult for the Russian dictator to maintain his position. So, it is worth expanding this experience of ours – long-term support programs. Each of these decisions is not easy. But each of them is a defense of freedom and our Europe. A secure Europe. And one more thing. I thank everyone who is making every effort to preserve unity. Unity with Ukraine. Unity within the European Union. Transatlantic unity. I would like to emphasize unity with regard to the situation in the Middle East, Charles said about it. And we must do everything to prevent an even larger international fire from breaking out in the Middle East. The enemies of freedom are very interested in bringing the free world to the second front… We must clearly see this scenario and counter it – together, of course. I thank all the leaders whose active diplomacy is already working to promote security. The sooner security prevails in the Middle East, the sooner we will restore security here – in Europe. The clear proof of unity is the participation of the representatives of all your countries in the third meeting of NSAs coming Saturday in Malta together with representatives of all continents, both Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia. They will discuss the Ukraine&#x27;s Peace Formula, the effective instrument of bringing civility to Europe. The key geopolitical manifestation of unity for Europe – unity on the issue of EU enlargement – should also be viewed from the perspective of security. It is clear that each nation&#x27;s path to the EU is a work based on merit and institutional development. Ukraine is doing this work. And I think, it is doing it well. Even despite the full-scale war, we are not asking for exceptions to the general rules. Ukraine has practically implemented 7 recommendations of the European Commission – both the simpler solutions and the solutions that were difficult for politicians. And we are counting on your unity in response – the decision to start negotiations on Ukraine’s accession to the European Union. This decision will be one of the strongest in that decade, and in many ways, it will determine the entire future path of the European Union. Either all of our Europe, together with Ukraine, together with Moldova, and in the future, together with Georgia and Belarus, – will win, or… The past will win. I am sure you are all on the side of modern Europe. We must win. Thank you very much for your attention! May the EU be strong! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>We are expanding our capabilities and seeing the end of the war with a Ukrainian victory more clearly – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-26</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! Today, there is a decision regarding two new defense support packages – from America and Denmark. The American package includes, among other things, missiles for air defense, missiles for HIMARS, ammunition, including 155mm... The total amount of this American package is $150 million. I thank President Biden, his team, the U.S. Congress, and all Americans who value freedom. It is very important that the enemies of freedom do not have the illusion that the defense of freedom cannot withstand a defensive marathon. The substantial Danish package is over $500 million. This includes additional armored vehicles for our soldiers – tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, drones, artillery ammunition. Thank you, Denmark! This is what truly helps us protect the lives of our people on the front lines. Today, I spoke with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark. Very substantive, regarding the further development of our defense cooperation, the preservation of unity in Europe among all our partners, and our Peace Formula. I am grateful to Denmark for their readiness to really advance the implementation of the Peace Formula. We are continuing to prepare for the Peace Formula meeting in Malta and are adding more participants. I participated in the European Council meeting, attended by the leaders of EU countries, President of the European Council Charles Michel, as well as President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola. The European Union is preparing several steps that we are expecting. This includes new sanctions against Russia and new steps in support of Ukraine. We are particularly anticipating the EU&#x27;s political decision to open negotiations on our country&#x27;s membership, and from our side, we are doing everything to be prepared. Today, I signed one of the most important laws on the path to starting the negotiations – the law on PEPs, politically exposed persons. This law strengthens the financial monitoring of the lives of key state officials and members of parliament. Its adoption is a clear signal of how seriously Ukraine takes the task of joining the European Union and making the work of its public institutions truly transparent. And, of course, the front. Today, I chaired a meeting of the Military Cabinet. A special format of working with commanders, intelligence leaders, the Security Service of Ukraine, and the Minister of Defense. Reports from every front – our generals Syrsky, Tarnavsky, Hnatov, Moskaliov, Sodol. Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny. Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov and Chief of External Intelligence Lytvynenko. Our strategic tasks. Supplies for our soldiers – ammunition, equipment. The Ukrainian defense industry. We are expanding our capabilities and seeing the end of the war with a Ukrainian victory more clearly. Of course, we all must realize that the enemy is not simple and won&#x27;t become simpler. But Ukraine must become – and will become – stronger. So that we permanently record in history that the Russian empire will never come to Ukrainian land again. Glory to all our soldiers! Guys, I thank you for every destroyed Russian position! Glory to our entire nation! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>May today everyone be united by the feeling of how much the Ukrainian language, all our people went through, so that Ukraine will always be free – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-27</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! Report for the day. A special ceremony to honor the memory of our fallen heroes – Heroes of Ukraine. I awarded the orders of the Golden Star to the families of soldiers. 21 warriors. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine. Completely devoted to the state, their comrades, and their duty to Ukraine. Eternal memory to them! And eternal gratitude. Today, I held two international conversations: with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President of the United Arab Emirates. We discussed our common defense of international law, the implementation of the Peace Formula, and the advisors&#x27; meeting in Malta, which starts tomorrow. We also talked about what can be done to prevent a large-scale war in the Middle East and a greater catastrophe for people. I discussed with Prime Minister Sunak our joint steps to strengthen our defense, including anti-aircraft missile systems and anti-drone means. And there&#x27;s a very powerful package from Germany – exactly what we agreed upon with Mr. Chancellor. Before winter, we will receive anti-aircraft missile systems, another Iris-T system, missiles for air defense, artillery rounds, and radars. This will significantly aid our soldiers and the defense of our cities. Thank you, Olaf! I held a Military Cabinet meeting regarding the situation on the main battlefronts. Kupiansk, Bahmut direction, Avdiyivka, Maryinka, and Melitopol direction. Ensuring our defense and offensive actions, including long-range weapons and missiles. I thank all the warriors who are holding their positions firmly and eliminating the occupiers. This week has significantly increased Russian losses. This is how it should be. I conducted a meeting on shelters – ensuring their readiness and accessibility for people. The tasks that were set and the results achieved. A complete review of all shelters in Ukraine has been carried out. A special website has been created where one can see the condition of shelters across the country and the progress of shelter-related work. The Ministry of Strategic Industries is overseeing this. Overall, at the local level, most regions are taking shelter-related matters more seriously. We must continue this work. And one more thing. Today is Ukrainian Literature and Language Day. As always, many people were united on this day by the nationwide radio dictation of national unity. May today everyone be united by the feeling of how much Ukraine, the Ukrainian language, and all our Ukrainian people endured, accomplished, went through, survived, and did to ensure that Ukraine always remains free and one day celebrates its victory. Its own. Long-awaited. I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for our country and our independence! We remember each and every person who gave their life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our joint efforts are laying a new global tradition of unity helping us learn how to end all wars – the speech of the President of Ukraine at the third meeting of advisors on the implementation of the Peace Formula in Malta</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-28</span></div>
  <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen! Dear co-authors and co-workers of peace! All nations on earth have gone through war. Men and women who returned from battles and did not forget what they had gone-through until their last breath… Children who were maimed by war… Families who were left with only pain and ashes and gravestones instead of their loved-ones. There is no place in the world that has not seen the human blood shed in battles. It is said in different languages that the history of mankind is the history of wars. But I want us all to be able to say one day that from now on, the history of people is a history of peace only. We see this aspiration in many sacred books. And most hearts respond to this. We see this aspiration stipulated in the international law and in the UN Charter. But does the UN Charter work? Here in Ukraine, and in the Middle East, and in African countries, the answer to this question is the cries of mothers burying their sons and daughters killed in wars, and the despair of children orphaned by wars… We can and must give a different answer. The world has seen too much blood. Last year, I proposed a Peace Formula. 10 points that cover all aspects of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and are based on the principles of the UN Charter and the UN General Assembly resolutions approved by the world. Over the year, our Peace Formula has gradually become global – because all of you have supported it or at least shown an active interest in working on it. This Formula has truly become a common one. What are the main things the Peace Formula can do? Very important things. First, the Peace Formula ensures the full force of the UN Charter to stop the aggression against our country and eliminate all its consequences, and thus can later become a model when the full power of international law can prevent other aggressions. Secondly, the Peace Formula enables each country to become a leader in its part and of its kind to restore peace and play an independent role in making peace. And the third, our joint efforts are laying the foundation for a new global tradition of unity – when helping one country end a war, it helps us learn how to end all wars. There are no two wars alike, but the Peace Formula can and should be universal. The plan for its implementation needs to be joint – to reflect not a particular national position, but the position of people, of all mankind. We shall prepare a joint action plan and then submit it to the Global Peace Summit – at the level of leaders – to approve and implement it for the sake of peace, for the sake of the protection of every nation from wars. And let this result be our common legacy for humanity! And I am grateful to every nation and international organization represented here in Malta. In total, almost 70 global actors have already joined the Peace Formula process. I thank everyone! I am grateful to Malta, to the Government of Malta and every Maltese for hosting this Summit. I am grateful to Denmark for the first meeting in this format – in Copenhagen. I am grateful to Saudi Arabia and Jeddah for developing this format. I am grateful to all the leaders who addressed the participants of the meeting, either personally or by sending messages… Mr. President Niinistö of Finland, Mr. President Ramaphosa of South Africa, Mr. Prime Minister Kishida of Japan, Mr. Prime Minister Denkov of Bulgaria, Cardinal Parolin of the Vatican and Grands Chancellor Montecupo. I would like to specifically mention the international institutions that supported the Peace Formula – the UN, the Council of Europe, the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament, which, by the way, is headed by a Maltese woman, Roberta Metsola, a defender of international law and a brave person, who was among the first to visit Ukraine after the start of full-scale aggression and has consistently helped to defend lives. Thank you all who works for peace! I wish you a fruitful summit! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Our Peace Formula gradually, step by step, is becoming global – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-28</span></div>
  <p>I wish you all good health, dear Ukrainians! Today is the first day of the summit in Malta – a meeting of advisors and diplomatic representatives regarding our Peace Formula, which gradually, step by step, is becoming global. Sixty six countries are represented at the summit, and it is a good result. All continents are represented. Many countries, different political traditions. I thank all the leaders and countries that have already supported our common vision for peace. And there is potential to expand the representation of states. The points of our Formula are created in such a way that everyone in the world who truly values international law can express themselves and their values and support global efforts against aggression. Right now at the Malta summit, work is underway on five of the ten points of the Formula. These are &quot;Radiation and nuclear safety,&quot; &quot;Food security,&quot; &quot;Energy security,&quot; &quot;Release of all prisoners and deported persons,&quot; and &quot;Restoration of Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity and the world order.&quot; For each point of the Formula, groups of states, focusing on implementation, have been created. The work on the Formula is led by Andriy Yermak, with teams from the Office of the President, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, government officials, and representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who adds such diplomatic strength to Ukraine. Last year, when I first introduced the Formula, the world was still discussing various visions and fairly different approaches to restoring our state border and achieving a fair peace. The global majority is gradually uniting around a common and fair vision reflected in the Peace Formula. Unity of the world is what is truly needed for aggressors to be defeated. And it is very symbolic that such a strong display of international unity we have today, on October 28, the day when in Ukraine we commemorate the Second World War and the anniversary of the expulsion of the Nazis from our territory. Back then, the Ukrainian people, along with many nations, fought to defeat evil. Unity gave the peoples the necessary strength. Not only to defeat Nazism and punish the Nazis for their crimes against humanity – for the Holocaust, for the destruction of nations, but also to establish an architecture of security and peace that would protect against a new global war. We can see now that the architecture created then did not work. But unity will certainly work effectively. The unity of all who help Ukraine defeat ruscism. And we will defeat it. For sure. And the unity of everyone in the world who works together with us, together with all our partners, to restore the strength of international law and the real weight of the principles and norms of the UN Charter. The world is not a place for aggression. Humanity will come to this understanding. This is the only way to protect life. And one more thing. Today, I want to particularly commend the Ukrainian border guards. There will come a time – we are doing everything to bring it closer – when the Ukrainian border guards will work peacefully on all sections of our sovereign state border. Right now, many of them, along with all the defense and security forces, are fighting on the front lines to bring the time of peace closer for Ukraine. I thank the entire personnel of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. And special gratitude from us deserve... The warriors of the Kramatorsk Border Guard Unit, especially Senior Sergeant Roman Malysh and Major Vadym Kostenko. They are fighting near Bahmut. Thank you for your strength! Also in Donetsk region, soldiers from the Kharkiv Border Guard Unit are performing their tasks – Senior Soldier Oleksandr Kovalenko and Senior Lieutenant Serhiy Sydorsky. Thank you, warriors! The Lyman direction, the Mohyliv-Podilsky Border Guard Unit, Senior Sergeant Oleksandr Leus. Thank you for your courage! Kupiansk direction, the &#x27;Steel Border&#x27; brigade – Sergeants Anatoliy Pavlovsky, Valeriy Pokrytiuk, Mykola Bilyk, and Senior Sergeant Maksym Bazarov. Thank you, warriors, for destroying Russian equipment and artillery! Glory to all who fight and work for our state and the liberation of all of Ukraine from the occupiers! Thank you to everyone around the world who is helping! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It&#x27;s important never to forget how many people make efforts to protect our country and Ukrainians – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-29</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! First, there is good news from the meeting in Malta – the meeting of advisors on the Peace Formula. A joint statement of the co-chairs of the summit, both basic and unifying, has been agreed upon. This is the right signal. No matter what is happening in the world, the most important thing is unity for the sake of the real power of international law, as this is unity for the sake of justice for Ukraine and all countries and nations that may face aggression. Second, we are already preparing for important steps planned for the first weeks of November. In general, this November and December are set to be significant for Ukraine. This includes new defense packages and the development of our relations with the European Union, by the way. We are also preparing for international events planned in Ukraine. Our work with partners will remain active. And third, this is our gratitude. It&#x27;s important never to forget how many people – different people – put in their efforts to protect our country and Ukrainians, to preserve Ukraine, the resilience of our state, our society, and each and every one of us. Only on this day did Russian occupiers launch brutal attacks on our Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia regions. There were missiles and drones too. I thank all our air defense warriors! I thank everyone in the security and defense forces of Ukraine! And today, I want to specifically highlight those people in different regions of Ukraine who, despite all the difficulties, arrive at the scene of shelling at any time of the day, eliminate the consequences of the strikes, clear debris, demine the territory, extinguish fires, save people, and document evidence of Russian terrorism. These are all our employees of the State Emergency Service, all our doctors, emergency response workers, utility workers, our volunteers, our police, investigators, and forensic experts, prosecutors, our sappers, and pyrotechnicians. Everyone who helps. I thank you! I want to express my gratitude separately to the entire staff of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Kherson region, especially those who work in the city of Beryslav and other towns and villages that are constantly under attack by occupiers. Bombs, artillery... But our people there are never left without help. Captain Mykola Ilchyshyn, the head of the 6th State Fire and Rescue Unit of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Kherson region. Oleksandr Chaika, the chief master officer and commander of the detachment of this 6th fire and rescue unit. Yevhen Shatailo, the driver and civil defense service sergeant. Thank you for your bravery, for your dedication to Ukraine! Zaporizhzhia region. The State Emergency Service of the region – thank you all, everyone who works for the people! I particularly want to mention Sergeant Andriy Nikolaenko, Master Sergeant Oleksiy Svertnev, Major Vitaliy Sheremet, and Lieutenant Colonel Nazar Kutovy. Our firefighters. Thank you, guys, and all your colleagues! Khmelnytsky region, which Russian troops target with missiles and Shahed drones... I want to acknowledge the work of the 18th and 21st State Fire and Rescue Units of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Khmelnytsky region. In particular – Serhiy Lykholat, a firefighter and rescue worker, a sergeant. Also, Oleh Mykhailiuk, a master sergeant, also a firefighter and rescue worker. Vitaliy Zakharchuk, a captain and head of the unit. Serhiy Bondaruk, chief master sergeant and commander of the unit. Thank you! Rescuers who work in Kharkiv region. In particular, the 44th and 54th State Fire and Rescue Units, whose employees were among the first to arrive in the village of Hroza after the terrible attack by Russian occupiers on October 5. During the rescue operation, Sergeant Serhiy Horbenko, Master Sergeants Oleksiy Kuzub and Dmytro Lahutin, and Sergeant Oleksandr Sinchenko helped a lot. Thank you, guys, for your dedication to work! Thank you to all our people, everyone who remembers that the most important thing is to take care of Ukraine, of Ukrainians, and of each other. To find your place in the national resistance against Russian aggression. To fight for Ukraine. To work for Ukraine. To contribute something of your own to the collective effort of Ukrainians. Glory to all who are not indifferent! This is so important! Glory to our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We all must be strong, united, we must withstand to prove that freedom is indeed stronger than aggression – President of Ukraine&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-30</span></div>
  <p>I wish good health to all Ukrainian men and women! First and foremost, I want to acknowledge our combat brigades. All the warriors who are fighting at the hottest sections of the front lines. Thank you to all the warriors who, through their assaults and their resilience – heroic resilience – demonstrate in practice that Ukraine is capable of resisting Russian pressure, capable of defeating the occupiers, capable of winning. The 53rd and 110th separate mechanized brigades, the 79th separate airborne assault brigade. Thank you, guys, for Avdiyivka and Maryinka! The 14th, 32nd, and 57th separate motorized infantry brigades – thank you for defending the Kupiansk direction. The 80th separate airborne assault brigade and the 93rd separate mechanized brigade – thank you, warriors, for the Bahmut direction, for advancing! The 33rd separate mechanized brigade – thank you for your strength in battles in the south of Ukraine! Today, I had important negotiations with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. I informed him about the situation on the front lines, about our actions, our capabilities. I am grateful for the assistance! For air defense systems, for ammunition for our soldiers, for powerful things that help us maintain the security of the eastern part of the Black Sea. Our agreements with Mark, which we discussed during the meeting in Odesa, are being implemented. It is also very important that the Netherlands has become the first state outside the G7 with which we started bilateral work on security guarantees. We discussed with the Prime Minister the results of the advisors&#x27; meeting on the Peace Formula in Malta. I met with a delegation from the U.S. Congress – three congressmen who are currently visiting Ukraine. It&#x27;s an important visit of solidarity. I&#x27;m grateful to everyone in Congress – from both parties – who helps defend freedom, to President Biden, his team, and every American who understands that freedom in the world can only stand when America is strong, and when there is no doubt among the enemies of the free world about American leadership. I informed the congressmen about the situation on the front lines, the very successful use of U.S. ATACMS recently provided to our defense forces. Of course, we also discussed the issue of military and budgetary support. Today, I also held several important meetings regarding our future international steps. A wrap-up meeting regarding the advisors&#x27; meeting in Malta and future plans regarding the Peace Formula. A meeting on the expected assessment from the European Commission regarding our progress in European integration. And also a meeting regarding our strategy to keep the world&#x27;s attention on Ukraine, to support the unity that helps us defend ourselves and ensure the systematic weakening of the aggressor state. We must soberly assess the Russian system. They have mobilized all their forces to try not to lose what they seized in Ukraine, but in doing so, they have contaminated their own territory with such a level of hatred and degradation that, for the second time this year, Russia is losing control over events. We see that mutineers are heading to Moscow, and no one is stopping them. We see that the power vertical in Dagestan is evaporating, leading to a real upheaval. These are all signals that Russia can, for now, sustain military operations and increase pressure on the frontlines in some places but is unable to withstand this strategic confrontation. Strategically, we all must be strong, we must be united, and we must do everything possible and impossible to withstand, to reclaim what is ours, and to prove that freedom is indeed stronger than hatred and aggression. For this, our unity is needed, unity between us, unity across all of Europe, unity in America, and unity throughout the free world... Unity is the most effective, precise, and long-range weapon. I thank everyone who is helping! I thank each and every one who is fighting and working for the sake of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine&#x27;s success in the battle for the Black Sea is what will be in history textbooks – President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-10-31</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! Today, there have been several important events. Firstly, a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff. Today is the International Black Sea Action Day, a special day dedicated to our region and our shared waters with our partners. At the Staff meeting, the first issue discussed was the operation of our export corridors, the defense of southern Ukraine – our cities, our ports – against Russian attacks. All of this matters not only to our state, not only to Ukraine&#x27;s security but much more broadly. During the full-scale war, we proved that when Ukraine, together with its partners, restores security to the Black Sea, the world gains dividends of greater security for other regions. This ranges from food security to social security because the stability of the food market influences the political stability of many countries in the complicated African and Asian regions. It is very important that due to Ukrainian courage, we practically push the Russian fleet out of the eastern part of the Black Sea – Russia cannot use our sea to extend its aggression to other parts of the world, as it did with Syria. When Russia caused a humanitarian catastrophe in Syria, using the Black Sea as its base, and later our Crimea as a staging ground for Russian military operations. Now, the situation has changed. Fundamentally changed. And when we add even more security to the Black Sea, Russia will lose any opportunity to dominate this area and spread its influence and destructiveness to other countries. The more protection we have along our coastline and in our sea, the more protection there is in the world. Today, at the Staff meeting, reports were presented by the commander of the Navy, the Defense Intelligence Chief, and the Chief of the Security Service of Ukraine regarding our actions in the south and at sea. The Commander-in-Chief and the commanders of the directions also reported. I am grateful to all our people involved in this work for making Ukraine stronger in the respective directions. Of course, we analyzed the events on the frontlines – in all key points. Avdiyivka, Maryinka, Kupiansk, Lyman sector, the south – guys, thank you for today! There were reports from the Minister of Defense and the Minister for Strategic Industries on ammunition and equipment at the Staff meeting – we are increasing our production and preparing new defense packages from our partners. Today, I held a special ceremony to award state honors to our soldiers who strengthen Ukrainian power in the battle at sea. The servicemen of the Navy and border guards who defend our waters. Soldiers of the Defense Intelligence and the Security Service. Engineers who create our new weapons – our naval drones – and ensure their functioning. These are all guys who cannot be shown in public, and their names cannot be tied to specific events. For now, as long as the war continues. But they truly deserve the gratitude of the state and the people. I thanked them on behalf of all Ukrainians. I held a preparatory meeting regarding our work with the European Union. One of Ukraine&#x27;s key political goals by the end of this year is our readiness to begin negotiations on EU membership. All levels of the state must be prepared for this, and they will be. We expect a similar readiness from European institutions – we clearly understand the priorities, and we are preparing our steps accordingly. I also spoke with Prime Minister of Bulgaria Denkov about everything that is relevant to this day, this time for Ukraine. I&#x27;m thankful to Bulgaria for their support of our European Union integration and for our highly productive partnership, especially in the Black Sea – in trade and security. It&#x27;s important that the agreements we reached during my visit to Bulgaria are fully implemented. We also discussed our additional security options. The modern world quickly gets accustomed to success. When full-scale aggression began, many around the world expected Ukraine to not withstand. Now, the incredible things our people, our soldiers, are doing are perceived as a given. Ukraine&#x27;s success in the battle for the Black Sea is what will be in history textbooks, though it&#x27;s not discussed as often now. But... Whatever may be, we must do our part – protect our country, Ukrainian independence, our lives, our culture, Ukrainian freedom. And we will protect it! I thank everyone in the world who is helping Ukraine. Glory to every one of our soldiers! Glory to all those who never retreat, never burn out, who believe in Ukraine just as they did on February 24, and who continue to fight for Ukraine, those who care for Ukraine. Adding strength to our state every day – that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I am confident that Ukraine will make our Europe stronger than ever – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-01</span></div>
  <p>I wish good health to all Ukrainians, both men and women! First and foremost, gratitude to our sky defenders – the soldiers of mobile fire groups, Ukrainian pilots, and soldiers of anti-aircraft missile units, all units that destroy Russian aircraft, missiles, and drones... Last night, 18 Shahed drones and one guided air missile were shot down. Unfortunately, there are several hits. But most of the enemy targets have been destroyed. Including in Poltava region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Vinnytsia region, and Khmelnytsky region, in other regions of our country. I thank our soldiers for this. We all need to remember clearly: every such downing means saving lives and infrastructure. And I ask all Ukrainians to pay attention to air raid alerts and to understand that, even though we are strengthening our air defense as much as possible, the danger is still significant. Especially in cities like Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson. In the cities and villages of Kherson region, Donetsk region. In Chernihiv, Sumy regions. It&#x27;s important to be cautious and not take the danger lightly. Today, I held several important meetings and, as always, a video conference: with the military, intelligence, government officials, and those responsible for the situation in the regions. I also had a meeting with our team that represented Ukraine at the advisors&#x27; meeting on the Peace Formula. We discussed the main details and outcomes of this summit. We are not revealing at the moment some things, which are very beneficial for Ukraine and international law in general. The reason is clear: we don&#x27;t want to give Russia a chance to undermine our international efforts. But I can say that this, the third advisors&#x27; meeting, was even stronger than the two held before it. It continued to consolidate the world. There is a joint statement of the co-chairs of the advisors&#x27; meeting in Malta. And there are many signals from representatives of states, including the Global South and our partners in Europe and in the United States, confirming the correctness of our course to unite the world around the Peace Formula, so that the principles of a just peace and the full restoration of international law become a common plan for the world&#x27;s majority. Today, during the meeting, we identified the main steps we will take in the coming months to add new substance to the Peace Formula. Another very important thing. Today&#x27;s date has a special geopolitical and values-based meaning. This day, November 1, is practically celebrated as the birth of the European Union. Thirty years ago, the Maastricht Treaty came into force, laying the foundations for modern European unity. There was a lot of resistance to Europe to be united, a lot of doubt about a united Europe. And even today, anti-European policies are quite vocal in various countries, including those where European optimism is critically important for maintaining peace and normalcy in Europe and the world. However, the European Union has proven time and again that it can overcome crises, defend itself, preserve its valuable leadership in the world, and become stronger when Europe&#x27;s enemies expect only weakness. We value our Europe, the Europe of cooperation, not confrontation, the Europe of people, not ideologies, because only in this way can our continent protect and defend human lives both in European countries and in the world. I am confident that Ukraine will make our Europe stronger than ever, and we are working actively to remove any obstacles to our accession to the European Union. I am also confident that no matter how events unfold in the world, among our partners in the United States and elsewhere, unity will prevail. Unity, not division. Unity, not calls for isolation. I thank everyone for their support for Ukraine, for our joint efforts to defend our European values. I also thank everyone in the world who helps to preserve unity, from Washington to every capital where people value human lives. Glory to all who fight for freedom! Glory to our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I am confident Ukraine will definitely win; be confident in yourselves – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-02</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! A brief report for this day. First – a video conference. The military, intelligence, our security forces, government officials. Special attention, of course, to the front. And a report on the work of our maritime export corridor – I am grateful to all who are fighting and working to ensure Ukraine&#x27;s access to the global market. The results are good. Russia is gradually losing control of the Black Sea and retreating to the eastern part of the waters... We will reach them there as well. Second – an extended meeting with our government officials. Regarding the steps Ukraine needs to take, both in the context of our transformation and in our work with partners. Specific reforms. In various areas. We are preparing bills and government decisions. Some of them will be adopted in the coming weeks. Third – a conversation with President of the European Council Charles Michel. Our progress in moving towards the European Union. The decision we expect this year regarding the start of membership negotiations. This decision will be significant, a very symbolic step that reflects how much Ukraine has achieved. We also discussed the situation in the Middle East – the threat of escalation, a tragic scenario. It is important to protect as many lives as possible. I invited Charles, Mr. President, to visit Ukraine. Fourth – I had a meeting with the Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, who visited Ukraine. The minister visited Kharkiv – and I am grateful for this, for the attention to one of our largest cities, which suffers from practically daily Russian terror. We discussed in detail the defense support that the Netherlands provides, and this is vital. Our agreements with Mark, Mr. Prime Minister Rutte, are being fully implemented. I am grateful to the entire political class of the Netherlands and the entire society for their belief in Ukraine, for their belief in our people. Fifth – I am grateful to the United States for the new and very powerful sanctions decision. More than 220 Russian – and not only Russian – entities that work on aggression are now under U.S. sanctions. This is what is needed. Critical sectors of the aggressor&#x27;s economy. Sensitive schemes for terrorists. And every sanctions decision must work in full – so that there is no chance for Russia to circumvent the sanctions. The power of sanctions is the power of the world. We are constantly communicating with our partners for this purpose – a united world must only become stronger. Two more things. I had a very substantive meeting with government officials. Various directions of government work. We discussed the steps needed for the transformation of our state, our work with partners, with donors. About government decisions, the necessary bills, strengthening institutions. We set priorities and are preparing new steps – in the coming weeks, by the end of the year, and on an annual basis. And what I do every day is a great honor for me. Our warriors. Our gratitude. Those who distinguished themselves on this day. The Vuhredar direction – our strong 72nd separate mechanized brigade. Thank you, guys! Maryinka – the paratroopers of the 79th brigade, well done! Avdiyivka direction – the 31st, 47th, 53rd, and 110th separate mechanized brigades. I thank every soldier! And Kupiansk direction – the 14th and 32nd separate mechanized brigades, the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade – I&#x27;m proud of you, guys! And I have confidence in you – just like on February 24th. I am confident that Ukraine will definitely win. Be confident in yourselves. I am proud of everyone who fights for Ukraine, who destroys occupiers, who restores our positions. Those who are in the trenches right now. Those who are at combat posts. Those who train our soldiers. Those who produce weapons, ammunition, and equipment for Ukraine. Those who teach our children. Those who treat and save after strikes. Those who provide a normal life in our cities. Those who give us light. Everyone who gives us confidence – our parents, our children... Those who love us. Those who pray for us, for victory. Those who help us from all corners of the world. Those who endured basements and occupation – and did not break. Everyone who does everything every day to liberate Ukraine and Ukrainians from Russian captivity. I am proud of you, Ukrainian people! I am proud of you, Ukrainian soldier! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every time I meet with our soldiers, I see not just a readiness to defend Ukraine, but a determination to win this war – President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-03</span></div>
  <p>I wish good health to all Ukrainian men and women! Today, I had the honor to visit and greet our soldiers – artillery, missile forces, and engineering troops. Today is the professional day of these branches of the military. I awarded our defenders with state honors and expressed my gratitude to their commanders. I want to say to every artillery soldier, every missile force warrior, and every engineering troop member – you are truly our backbone, the backbone of all defense and security forces. It&#x27;s what allows everyone to be resilient and specified divisions to move forward, to advance on the frontlines, and to gain new positions every day. Every five hundred meters, every kilometer that our guys pass, are new operational capabilities for Ukraine, especially for our missiles. By the way, this autumn, we&#x27;ve achieved good and very important results in destroying the Russian air defense systems and the enemy&#x27;s combat aircraft. We will continue this work, and I thank everyone who helps us with this. I ordered a reshuffle in the command structure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine – I appointed Colonel Serhiy Lupanchuk as the new commander of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He is an experienced officer, a combat officer, the right man in command, and someone who can bring greater power to our Special Operations Forces. We look forward to new results. General Viktor Khorenko, who commanded the Special Operations Forces, will continue to perform special tasks as part of Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. I held a preparatory meeting regarding the next week – political work and our steps together with the European Union. We use every day to add substance to the preparation for the decision to start negotiations on our country&#x27;s accession to the European Union. We understand the time limits and political steps clearly. And today, I signed an important law regarding national communities. We&#x27;ve implemented another criterion for our European integration. Additional guarantees for national communities in Ukraine, additional guarantees for our movement toward the European Union. We continue our work in implementing the recommendations of the European Commission. And one more thing. Every time I meet with our soldiers – those on the frontlines, those preparing to return to the front, those deserving of state honors... Every time I meet with them, I see not just a readiness to defend Ukraine but a determination to win for Ukraine. To win in this war. We have our part to do. It&#x27;s our need. I remember well how people were feeling on February 24 and in the early days of the full-scale war. I remember what was said and who said it. Who believed and who was mistaken by not believing in Ukraine. It&#x27;s important to be as confident in Ukraine now as we were back then. Russia wanted Kyiv, but they were forced to flee. They wanted Kharkiv and claimed it as a Russian city, but our Kharkiv is and always will be free. The same goes for Kherson. The same goes for Odesa. And we will not abandon our people in the occupied territories – I want them to hear this now. It&#x27;s about millions of destinies. All our partners know what&#x27;s needed... For the front, for our skies, for our cities, and for our movement. I thank everyone in the world who is helping! I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine can accomplish significant achievements when working together in the interests of its independence and all Ukrainians – President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-04</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! Today, a very important visit took place. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission. Just before the European Commission&#x27;s report on our compliance with the recommendations for opening accession negotiations. We expect such a political decision later this year. We have been very active throughout the year in fulfilling these recommendations. We have passed legislation, implemented systemic solutions, and are strengthening our state institutions. We are providing law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies with more opportunities to work effectively. We have also addressed the issues of national communities. The full spectrum defined by the European Commission. However, I want to emphasize that this is not something that someone in Europe, in Brussels, tells Ukraine to do. The transformation of our state is something that we need ourselves. Ukraine has passed an enormous path – from a point where many didn&#x27;t believe in the possibility of our alignment with the European Union during a full-scale war to achieving the status of a candidate country at record speed and fulfilling the necessary prerequisites for opening negotiations. This is proof, time and time again, that Ukraine can accomplish significant achievements when working unitedly, confidently, in the interests of our independence and all Ukrainians. We continue to transform our state to be genuinely prepared for full EU accession, adapting all our institutions, all our standards to European rules. As of now, we understand the next steps our country will take. Today, after the meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, I&#x27;ve already mentioned some of them, such as a bill that provides the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x27;s Office with more opportunities to work effectively and a lobbying law, which should have been enacted decades ago. We will address other necessary issues as well. We all in Ukraine should already get used to the fact that our domestic policy is the policy of European integration, and it is what brings us closer to the moment when the Ukrainian flag will be in Brussels alongside all the other flags of EU member states. Today, from the President of the European Commission, I heard positive signals regarding our progress towards the start of negotiations. Of course, we discussed all our fundamental issues: support for Ukraine – long-lasting and diverse, new sanctions against the occupier, our joint efforts regarding frozen Russian assets, which should be used to compensate for the damage from Russian aggression. I thank President von der Leyen for her strong and principled support. One more thing for today. In the morning, I had the honor of joining Ursula in congratulating our railway workers on their professional day. Now, during the full-scale war, it has become evident to everyone just how important the work of our railway workers is for the country and the normal lives of our people. It goes beyond just transportation; it is one of the cornerstones of our resilience. It is a salvation of people. It often involves the heroism of many men and women who, under constant threat and particularly in the early weeks of the full-scale war, continued to work for the sake of people and our defense. It is crucial to remember each and every one who has dedicated their life to ensure Ukraine&#x27;s endurance. Different people. Our heroes on the frontlines. People of various professions who contribute. We must be grateful. We must preserve unity. We must ensure that we walk together the path destined for us by our fate. To protect Ukraine and pass on a guaranteed safe life to our children, grandchildren. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Warriors, I thank you! I thank everyone who helps! Ukraine is and will remain independent and free. I am confident in this. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Regarding Russian strike on soldiers of 128th Separate Mountain Infantry Brigade: The main thing is to establish the truth about what happened and prevent such incidents from happening again – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-05</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, First and foremost, regarding the Russian strike on the soldiers of the 128th Separate Mountain Infantry Brigade occurred in Zaporizhzhia region. My condolences to all the families and loved ones of the fallen soldiers! It is a tragedy that could have been avoided. Defense Minister Umerov has reported to me on the measures taken to clarify all the circumstances of what happened, who was specifically involved, and what orders were given. Criminal proceedings have been initiated in response to this tragedy. The relevant investigation is ongoing. The main thing is to establish the complete truth about what happened and prevent such incidents from happening again. Every soldier in the combat zone – in the enemy&#x27;s line of fire and aerial reconnaissance – knows how to behave in the open, how to ensure safety. Now, the investigation must provide honest answers to the families of the fallen soldiers and the society about how this tragedy occurred and whether any improper orders were issued. Secondly, what I would like to say today. When we go through weeks like this, filled with pain and difficult discussions, it is important for people to understand that what weighs on their hearts is seen, and the necessary changes will be made. This applies to many things, from negligence that can occur to the Soviet legacy and the terrible bureaucracy that prevents Ukraine and many in our defense forces from realizing their potential correctly and effectively. We must protect Ukraine. And we will protect it – I have no doubt about that. Believing in Ukraine is knowing that Ukraine and Ukrainians can preserve their independence, will preserve it and reclaim their own. But, just like after February 24th, this can be done together – and only together, in unity, caring for the state, for those next to you, for Ukrainians, no matter where they are. Preserving the unity of the people is the most important. And I am grateful to all those who make efforts for this. And one more thing. Avdiyivka. Mariyinka. Lyman. Bakhmut. Kupiansk. Melitopol direction. Kherson region. The artillerymen of the 55th Zaporizhzhia Sich brigade. The 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade. The 68th Separate Hunting Brigade. The 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade. The 33rd and 31st separate mechanized brigades. Our powerful 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade. The 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade. The 82nd Separate Airborne Assault Brigade. I thank all of you, soldiers, who fight for Ukraine, who believe in Ukraine! Thank you to all the commanders who truly care for the people! And thank you to all who work for Ukraine and help Ukraine in the world! Every week should make Ukraine stronger. It is essential. And it is a shared task for everyone in the state. All of us. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The battle that determines the fate of the state and people is now underway; it is not the right time for elections – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-06</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff. The first issue was related to the tragedy with the servicemen of our 128th separate mountain assault brigade. The military, the Minister of Defense, and the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine delivered reports. The specifics – what has already been figured out about the circumstances of the tragedy, whose orders entailed the tragedy. In particular, Chief Inspector of the Defense Ministry Voronchenko delivered a report. The brigade commander has been suspended for the time of investigation. The whole situation is being analyzed minute by minute. And it will be found out who exactly violated the rules on the safety of people in the area accessible to enemy aerial reconnaissance. There will be no avoidance of responsibility. The second issue at the Staff meeting was, of course, the reports by the Commander-in-Chief and the commanders on the directions of the main battles. The report of the intelligence. Our offensive actions. Our defensive actions. Avdiivka, Kupyansk, Kherson are the main focal points today. And our operations in the Black Sea. By the way, I thank everyone who ensured the successful targeting of the Russian warship at the Kerch shipyard. This is significant – another source of Russian terror against Ukraine has been eliminated. The Ministry of Strategic Industries and the Ministry of Defense reported on the supply of weapons and equipment to our brigades, the dynamics of defense production in Ukraine, and the fulfillment of contracts and agreements with partners. And I am grateful to all our friends in the world who help Ukraine with reliable, long-term support that strengthens us strategically. We are preparing for international events in November: today I held a meeting with the team regarding the meetings and negotiations that have already been scheduled. We expect new political activities with the European Union and many other partners in the world, in particular, regarding Ukraine&#x27;s global role as a guarantor of food security. The relevant details will be announced in the near future. And one more thing. A very important one. Last night, Russia struck at Odesa again. Missiles, &quot;Shaheds&quot;. Some of them were shot down. There were also hits. It was a difficult night for Odesa. Constant attacks on Kherson, Kherson region. Donetsk and Kharkiv regions. There was an air raid alert across the whole country today. Everyone should remember what is most important in Ukraine right now. The enemy is insane. And it is powerful. And it wants to destroy Ukraine, just as it has always wanted to. Now everyone should think about defending our country. We need to pull ourselves together, avoid unwinding and splitting up into disputes or other priorities. The situation is the same now as it was before: if there is no victory, there will be no country. Our victory is possible. It will come if we all focus on it. Not on politicking or searching for some personal interest. Not on disagreements that will do nothing for the country, defense, and our advancement. The resource of the state, the resource of the budget, the resource of our attention and emotions, the resource of our efforts – all this is needed for our victory. I will say it again. We all see people demanding that budget resources be allocated to help the defense instead of paving and repairing streets. This is the right thing to do. All resources should be used to make Ukraine stronger. We all hear what needs to be changed in the defense forces themselves: it concerns many procedures that are redundant, it concerns many difficulties that our warriors face. Transfers, training, and supply. There are many tasks. And all the relevant structures must deal with them without diverting their energy and efforts to anything else. We all see that now is not the time for grand celebrations or other brazen things in the rear, which are unacceptable in times of war, and even more so when the army, when all our defense forces live with completely different emotions: pain, battles, losses, but also achievements – achievements for Ukraine. And we all understand that now, in wartime, when there are so many challenges, it is absolutely irresponsible to throw the topic of elections into society in a lighthearted and playful way. I expect all relevant structures and authorities to provide concrete solutions to the challenges that our country is facing today. This applies to the civilian authorities, the military element of the state, the government officials, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine and other law enforcement agencies. It also means that the state needs to be much more focused on defense – everyone in the state, and especially at the regional level, in the rear cities that have the resources to help and support. This also applies to ensuring that tragedies like the one that happened to the servicemen of the 128th brigade never happen again. And to the changes our soldiers and commanders expect, especially the guys who were mobilized. And finally, the waves of any politically divisive things must stop. We must realize that now is the time of defense, the time of the battle that determines the fate of the state and people, not the time of manipulations, which only Russia expects from Ukraine. I believe that now is not the right time for elections. And if we need to put an end to a political dispute and continue to work in unity, there are structures in the state that are capable of putting an end to it and giving society all the necessary answers. So that there is no room left for conflicts and someone else&#x27;s game against Ukraine. My personal attitude and call is to take care of our country just as on February 24, to defend it, to destroy the occupier, to fight for the freedom of Ukraine, which is now being gained in the battles for Ukraine. I thank everyone who helps! Glory to all those who are fighting and working for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine means strengthening of the entire European community for the EU – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-07</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today is mostly a day of meetings. I have recently finished a meeting with the intelligence. It was a meeting in a narrow circle, very sensitive issues of protecting our people were discussed. Details will be available later. I also held a meeting on international events and our Ukrainian events that are expected in November. This month is both the anniversary of the beginning of the Revolution of Dignity and the anniversary of the Holodomor. There will be various components of government work, including an international component. Everything is being prepared. Special attention – and this is daily attention – is paid to relations with the European Union. Tomorrow is an important day. We are expecting the EU&#x27;s historic conclusion – a report on Ukraine&#x27;s implementation of the European Commission&#x27;s recommendations. We are already preparing our next steps after this report. Our legislative work, strengthening of state institutions. Ukraine has already come a long way in its rapprochement with the European Union, and our country is fully aware that becoming a member of the European Union is a political decision of all the countries that are already in the community and want to see a new state in the European Union, but it is also the work of the state itself. Our work is to bring EU standards and community practices closer to Ukraine and adopt them. Ukraine will be in the EU. And we will achieve this, in particular, through the transformation of our country – an internal transformation that is absolutely in the interests of our people. For Ukraine, the EU means economic security and social stability, and for the EU, Ukraine means strengthening of the entire community. And it is very important that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine continue to support the legislative initiatives necessary for our European integration. As usual, I started the day with a conference call. The most important was the report that additional NASAMS air defense systems had been deployed. And that&#x27;s not all. Ukraine&#x27;s sky shield will be further reinforced. I am grateful to the partners who help and to our entire team working in the international area. Of course, I was in touch with the Minister of Defense and the commanders throughout the day. Kupyansk, Bakhmut, Maryinka, Avdiivka, Melitopol direction, the whole south. We have results worth noting. The 108th separate mountain assault battalion of the 10th brigade, the 3rd battalion of the 54th brigade, the 92nd separate assault brigade, our artillerymen of the 26th, 40th and 55th separate artillery brigades, the &quot;Seventy-ninth&quot; air assault brigade, the 53rd and 110th separate mechanized brigades, the 3rd operational brigade of the National Guard and the 132nd separate reconnaissance battalion. Warriors, I thank you all for your strength! Your strength, the strength of everyone who is fighting for Ukraine, everyone who is helping, is the lifeblood of our people. Ukraine will prevail and be free. And it will be equal among equals in our common European home. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the history of Ukraine and the whole of Europe has taken the right step – the European Commission has recommended starting membership negotiations with Ukraine. This is a pure positive. Despite all the difficulties, we are moving forward. Already in December we expect a political decision from the European Council. Ukrainians have always been and remain part of our common European family. Our country must be in the European Union. Ukrainians deserve it both for their defense of European values and for the fact that even in times of full-scale war, we keep our word and develop state institutions. All the necessary decisions are being adopted. Thank you to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We already understand what steps are needed to bring the key goal – Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the EU – closer – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-08</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a day that Ukraine&#x27;s history will definitely remember. There is a positive signal from the European Commission – a recommendation to start negotiations on our country&#x27;s membership in the EU. This is exactly the decision we expected. I thank you, Ursula, Madam President of the European Commission, and all your colleagues for always having an unwavering and sincere belief in Ukraine. Our people deserve to be in the European Union – together with all the free peoples of our Europe. And we are doing everything for this. I am convinced that there is no alternative to the borders of a democratic Europe matching the borders of the European Union. After all, this is political protection for our common values, economic security, and – most importantly – one of the key guarantees of peace and freedom on the continent. We are now awaiting the European Council&#x27;s decision on the negotiations in December, and we have already prepared for this decision. Ukraine is doing its part. This is our top priority. And I am grateful to everyone in our country who contributes to this work. Of course, we already understand what next steps are needed to move forward after the European Council&#x27;s decision and bring the key goal – our country&#x27;s accession to the EU – closer. Ukrainian freedom, Ukrainian institutions, our common European home will only get stronger. Today, the Ambassador of the European Union to Ukraine, Mrs. Katarina Mathernova, handed me the report of the European Commission. Relevant meetings have already been held with representatives of the government and the Verkhovna Rada on the draft laws and reforms that are at the heart of our transformation – transformation of our state – and at the heart of our movement to the European Union. And I hope that the European Commission will start implementing its part of the joint work as soon as possible – assessing the compliance of Ukrainian legislation with the EU acquis. Today I spoke with the President of Moldova, Maia Sandu, and congratulated her on the European Commission&#x27;s decision for Moldova. We will coordinate our steps towards the European Union. It is important for Ukraine and the whole of Europe that Moldova is as successful and stable as possible. We will help. By the way, I informed Madam President about our actions to protect people in the Middle East. Ukraine has already helped evacuate 36 Moldovan citizens from the Gaza Strip. More than 40 Ukrainian citizens have also been rescued. I would like to recognize the efforts of the Main Intelligence Directorate and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, which are dealing with this issue. Thank you for that. I also spoke with the President of Georgia. I congratulated Georgia on the positive message from the European Commission. We in Ukraine sincerely support Georgia, Georgia&#x27;s independence and sincerely wish for the restoration of Georgia&#x27;s territorial integrity. When we are together on the European path, this can be done. In a conversation with Madam President of Georgia, I spoke about Ukrainian citizen Mikheil Saakashvili. His life matters, and it would be right to show humanity to his fate. Another aspect about the EU issue. Today I signed a decree on preparing the negotiation process with the European Union. Clear points. Clear instructions. We will approach the expected steps absolutely prepared. Several other international events took place today. The U.S. Secretary of Transportation visited Ukraine. I held a meeting and negotiations with him. For Ukraine, this is an absolutely important context, the development of our infrastructure, strengthening existing ties with the world, and creating new ones. Reconstruction. I am grateful to Mr. Secretary for his understanding of Ukraine. One more thing. A conversation with Mr. Prime Minister of Japan. I thanked Fumio for helping our country and for Japan&#x27;s leadership in protecting international law. We discussed our next steps – security, diplomatic, and economic. Japan is among those who do the most to support our freedom. And this is just one of our days. Ukraine&#x27;s power is evident. Ukraine&#x27;s successes in international work and in achieving our goals are evident. Solidarity with Ukraine is felt in all parts of the world. I finished this day talking to university students from Mexico – young men and women who are sincerely interested in Ukraine and want to know the truth about Ukraine and the Russian war against our country. I am grateful for the words of support, and I am grateful for every question that was asked. Mexico, by the way, was represented at the meeting of advisors on the Peace Formula that took place recently. The European Union, Moldova, Georgia, the United States, Japan, Mexico. I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps! Glory to all our people who are fighting and working for Ukraine! Our warriors – I thank you for every step you take, for your strength, which allows Ukraine to live. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>When our voices are heard in unison, we will prevail, and peace, justice and the rule of law will be restored – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to students and professors of universities in Mexico</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-09</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much! Dear participants! Dear rectors! I would like to thank you now, first of all, for your warm words – I was listening carefully – your warm words of support, Mr. Montemayor and Mr. Lascurain! Greetings to dear lecturers, dear students, and representatives of the diplomatic corps! I know that journalists also see us somewhere. Good afternoon, everyone! Thank you for this opportunity! Six months ago, I had the opportunity to address the General Congress of Mexico. My words were addressed to the people who make key decisions in your country. Today, it is important for me to address you. The generation that will shape the future of Mexico. And together with the next generations of other nations, a new and better world for all of us. And I would like to start this address with one of the most important questions, in my opinion, today. What is the difference between Ukraine and Russia? I really want the answer to this question to be known and understood by people in every corner of the world. On any continent of the planet. And let it sound in different languages, but unified and clear. Because without this answer, it is impossible to understand what is happening in Ukraine, why this war started and why it continues, how it affects the future of the world, what steps, actions and conclusions are required from humanity to prevent similar events in the years and centuries to come. What is the difference between Ukraine and Russia? The words of one of Mexico&#x27;s national heroes, Emiliano Zapata, describe it concisely and aptly. Es mejor morir de pie que vivir de rodillas! It is better to die standing than to live on your knees – this is the translation. Better to die as a warrior than to live as a slave. Ukrainians are fighting to be free. Russians are fighting to enslave another nation. The war is taking place on our land. And it is the Russian army that has invaded Ukraine, burning our cities and villages. The people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom at the cost of their own lives. The people of Russia have not stopped the war of aggression of the Russian regime and, unfortunately, a significant part of them, stupefied by Russian propaganda, supports it. Ukrainians are defending their land, their homes, protecting their families and their children. Russia is destroying other people&#x27;s homes, tearing apart other people&#x27;s families, and abducting other people&#x27;s children. The Mexican people, for whom family and family ties are sacred, understand our pain, I am sure of that. The pain felt by millions of Ukrainians whose families have been destroyed and separated as a result of Russia&#x27;s terrorist actions. They understand our thirst for justice, for resistance to evil and lawlessness, for victory and restoration of peace. For Ukraine, it is an anti-colonial war. For Russia, it is an attempt to restore the old empire that was destroying the lives of nations. Russia simply does not want to accept that we will live freely and have every right to our national independence and identity. These are simple facts about the ongoing war. But it is important to repeat and realize them in order to see and know who is on the bright side of history. Ukraine and Mexico are countries with different national destinies, but we are united by the same desire for freedom, peace and justice. We are two nations that deeply value their families, their land, and their right to decide their own future. To be safe, to be equal, to be free, to live in respect and to follow the path of development together with other nations on Earth. These are not just words, this is what we have defended and are defending every day. These are, in particular, the principles on which the key points of our Peace Formula – a peace plan designed to ensure a comprehensive, just and lasting peace – are built. Both in Ukraine and throughout the world, which is also suffering from the consequences of Russia&#x27;s aggression against us. And this is also the answer to the question about the difference between Ukraine and Russia. Russia started this war, started chaos and terror. Ukraine seeks to stop it, to overcome it, to defeat it. Ukraine seeks to restore its own security and overall stability on the continent. Russia is doing evil, Ukraine is resisting it. Russia threatens and blackmails, Ukraine defends and holds on. Russia is a criminal, Ukraine is a fighter. Russia seeks to divide the world, sows chaos and discord in different parts of the world, provokes the threat of hunger, migration, and environmental danger. Ukraine, together with its allies, counteracts this and seeks to unite the world. And not around the right of force, but around the power of law. Security. Order. Peace. The Formula we have proposed is a clear roadmap for how to achieve lasting peace, restore international law and order, prevent aggression, and guarantee common security in the future. Its key and integral element is the liberation of all territories and the restoration of Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty within internationally recognized borders. Otherwise, it will not be peace, but a truce. Which will be followed sooner or later by a new war. And we will simply shift unresolved problems onto our children. We are grateful to Mexico for participating in the recent meeting of diplomatic advisors on the implementation of the Formula in Malta. And I look forward to Mexico City&#x27;s continued support for this initiative. Mexico is one of the leading countries with a strong reputation in Latin America and the Caribbean. I am convinced that a world power of this caliber cannot stand aside from the crimes and unjustified bloody war unleashed by Russia against Ukraine. Ukrainians are waiting for a clear position of the Mexican government on the terrorist actions of the Russian leadership. We want to see your country among those who not only condemn the aggression in words, but also help us endure and survive. This assistance can be different. We know that Mexico is a neutral country that professes the principle of non-interference in the affairs of other countries. But neutrality does not mean indifference. We invite Mexico to join the efforts to overcome the consequences of aggression in the humanitarian, energy, and environmental spheres, and to restore and rebuild Ukraine. Every day in our country, people&#x27;s livelihoods and civilian infrastructure are being destroyed. The massive destruction is affecting education, healthcare, water and electricity supply. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee their homes, more than 5 million Ukrainian citizens are internally displaced, and more than 6 million are still abroad, forced to seek safety and protection in other countries. We appreciate any help in this difficult time for the Ukrainian people. And in particular, solidarity. It helps us hold on and fight for our independence. Ladies and gentlemen! What do you want your future world to look like? A world of peace, freedom and progress? Your decisions, your choice, your voice are important. Because the alternative is a world of chaos, violence and impunity, which Russia is trying to impose on everyone by launching an unprovoked, criminal war against Ukraine. Over the past two years, I have addressed and talked to leaders and peoples of dozens of different countries, students and young people on different continents. They have different views, speak different languages, practice different religions, but they all have a very similar vision of the future. Their own future. The future of their country. The future of the whole world. First of all, it is about values and key principles. About human life as the highest value, about freedom, independence, equality, respect, development. And I believe that our friends in Mexico share our views, our thoughts and dreams of peace. We want to feel your solidarity. So, I hope to hear a strong voice from Mexico – both from the public and from your government officials – in support of Ukraine. And when our voices are heard in unison, we will prevail, and peace, justice and the rule of law will be restored for the welfare and prosperity of all nations. Viva México! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>We are working with all partners to bolster air defense for Ukraine – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-09</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! We continue to build our relations with all countries of the Global South – Ukraine needs understanding in all parts of the world. Today I spoke with the President of Indonesia. By the way, it is the country where our Peace Formula was first presented a year ago at the G20 Summit. I have now informed Mr. President about the results we have achieved in attracting the world majority to the Peace Formula. I hope Indonesia will become part of this global effort. We also discussed the issue of global food security – our maritime export corridors. This is one of Ukraine&#x27;s greatest successes – clearing our sea of Russian warships. This gives more security both for us and for the whole world. I am grateful to all our warriors, all port workers, and everyone who helps, for keeping the Black Sea a living sea for global relations, not a zone of Russian terror. Of course, the suffering of people in the Middle East was one of the main topics of our conversation with the President of Indonesia. It is very important that as many civilians as possible are protected and that the war that is going on in the Middle East does not lead to a full-scale collapse of international stability. Everyone needs security and peace. I also spoke with Mr. President of Paraguay – Ukraine&#x27;s attention to Latin America and Latin America&#x27;s attention to our country should only increase. It is right for Latin American countries to be involved in global affairs, in the protection of human rights and the sovereignty of nations. Among all the things we discussed today with the President of Paraguay, I would like to emphasize our diplomatic efforts on the Peace Formula and our joint work on international platforms. I am grateful for supporting Ukraine. I would also like to thank Azerbaijan today. As we agreed with Mr. President Aliyev, on the eve of the winter, we have received appropriate assistance for our energy sector. We realize that this winter&#x27;s difficulties may be no less than last year&#x27;s. We are getting ready. And the support for Ukraine, our people, and our energy sector is critically important. We are also working with all our partners to get air defense systems for Ukraine – we are trying to add strength to our sky shield virtually every week. The more protected the Ukrainian sky, Ukrainian cities and villages are, the more opportunities our people will have for economic activity. For production, in particular, for defense production. No matter what happens in the world, Ukraine will have its own strength to defend its sovereignty. Today, I had meetings with the Prime Minister on current issues and needs of the state, and with the Minister of Foreign Affairs on his meetings and conversations with partners, new agreements that can be reached. I also held a meeting with the Main Intelligence Directorate – there are important intelligence results. I thank you guys. We continue to evacuate our citizens from the Gaza Strip – 89 of our people have been rescued so far. We continue this work. It is a very painstaking and delicate process. Today I also heard a report from the Security Service of Ukraine on countering collaborators. Well done, guys. Of course, the frontline. I am in touch with the military throughout the day. The hottest areas over the past day are Avdiivka, Maryinka, Kupyansk, and Bakhmut. I am grateful to all our brigades, to each unit for their resilience, for their strength, for the destruction of the occupiers. Southern directions – guys, I thank you for your strength. Our artillery, our missile forces and everyone who helps in the special services – I thank you for your accuracy. There are encouraging results. There will be more. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-10</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! Report for the day. I held a Staff meeting – special, focusing specifically on strategic issues. On preparations for our future defensive and offensive operations. Several important reports were presented at the Staff meeting today. The first one was about the defense budget for the next year, specific capabilities. The second report covered ammunition and equipment for ongoing operations. The third one – Kherson, the details of strengthening the defense of the city against Russian terror. Intelligence reported on the evacuation of our citizens from the Gaza sector, we are continuing our ongoing efforts. We also assist citizens of other countries, our partners whenever possible. I thank everyone involved in this work: the General Staff, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, embassies. Well done! By the way, thankful to the Defense Intelligence units performing combat missions on the front lines – on land and at sea. Of course, there were front-line reports from commanders today. I thank every unit, every brigade carrying out tasks in Kharkiv region, Donetsk region, and the south of our country. Warriors, I thank you! To all those in battle, at combat posts, and those providing assistance. Artillerymen of the 55th Brigade – as always, I am proud of you! Mariyinka direction – soldiers of the 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, thank you! Avdiyivka – the 53rd and 110th Separate Mechanized Brigades, thank you! Kupiansk – the 14th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, the 13th Battalion of the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade, the 3rd Battalion of the 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the 2nd Battalion of the 30th Separate Mechanized Brigade, and the 40th Separate Artillery Brigade – I thank all of you, soldiers! Today, I addressed the participants of the important forum in France – the Paris Peace Forum. The forum brought together leaders from Europe and other continents. It is crucial that all existing challenges, especially security challenges, receive global responses from the majority of the world. The more the world is united, the more lines of cooperation we have, the fewer chances there are for those who do not value human life to dominate. I am grateful to President Macron for organizing such international platforms. In recent days, the First Lady of Ukraine visited France as part of our cultural diplomacy. Olena took part in the opening of the representation of the Ukrainian Institute in Paris – an institution that promotes Ukrainian culture worldwide, unites our people, and people around the world based on culture. There is a memorandum of cooperation between the Ukrainian Institute and the University of Sorbonne. Olena also participated in the UNESCO conference – this organization helps us unite the world to protect Ukrainian cultural heritage from Russian attacks. There was a meeting between the First Lady of Ukraine and Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron. The highest level of attention to Ukraine. Thank you. A visit to France of First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Yulia Svyrydenko also took place. She discussed the establishment of a fund for the restoration of our critical infrastructure. The initiation of collaboration with the French Development Agency for Ukraine is also in progress. Today, I had a meeting with the Minister of National Defence of Lithuania – a good conversation. I expressed gratitude for the support already provided to Ukraine – it is significant. This includes weapons, political support, and the sincere support of Lithuanian society for Ukraine and Ukrainians. Our alliance is truly felt. I requested to convey our Ukrainian gratitude to President Nausėda. We also discussed further defense cooperation between Ukraine and Lithuania. We are working on the supply of armored medical evacuation vehicles for the troops on the front lines. We are preparing for other international communications and events – we will do everything to bolster Ukraine&#x27;s strength. Thank you to everyone who supports! Glory to our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The cooperation and unity of all who truly value peace that can prevent catastrophes and stop the suffering of peoples – address of the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Paris Peace Forum</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-10</span></div>
  <p>Dear leaders! Ladies and gentlemen! I am pleased to have the opportunity to address you and am grateful that in such difficult, turbulent times, the Paris Peace Forum remains active and contributes to global cooperation. And what is really important for global stability – it adds to the cooperation between Europe and Africa, Asia, Latin America… Now, in our time, the world is at a crossroads. Local wars can provoke a global collapse. The suffering in which a particular nation is thrown can drag neighboring nations into the abyss. But the world is not doomed to disasters and suffering… We are capable of making the right turn! It is precisely the cooperation and unity of all who truly value peace that can prevent catastrophes and stop the suffering of peoples. In this, every nation matters! It&#x27;s important to remember this. There are no few “great” ones who supposedly can decide something in the world for everyone… All nations are equal, and every nation deserves respect. Only such an approach can realize the right of every child of every nation to a world in which there are more examples of achieving peace than stories of its destruction. So, when I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula to protect our people and to create a globally significant precedent for the restoration of honest peace, I counted on global efforts, on the unification of the world&#x27;s majority, on cooperation that unites all continents. And gradually, we are achieving this. I am grateful to each of you who supports these efforts! And I call on you to multiply unity and joint work for the sake of providing the world with the necessary answers to existing global issues… Complex issues. But there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome by the unity of people. I thank France and President Macron personally for the unwavering belief in global cooperation, for new formats of such cooperation, and for their relentless energy in working towards uniting the world. Emmanuel, thank you for your vision of a safer world turning into real actions. Charles, Mr. President, thank you for your leadership and for directing Europe&#x27;s strength for the global good. And I thank all the leaders who are here at the Forum, and our colleagues who likewise value unity and consolidated work… May our joint efforts be fruitful! Thank you for your attention! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine always returns – President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address on the occasion of the first anniversary of the liberation of Kherson from Russian occupation</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-11</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainian men and women! Today marks the first anniversary of the liberation of Kherson from Russian occupation. The city-hero. The city-symbol. The city of hope. The city of our people who did not surrender to the enemy force and inspired everyone around us and the whole world with their resistance. These are our blue and yellow flags, which repeatedly proved on the streets of Kherson and in many homes and apartments that Ukraine is one, from the northern border to our sea. These are months without communication, without information, but with faith – faith in Ukraine. These are the efforts of many people who saved, helped, approached... And, of course, these are emotions – special emotions when you see your people are returning, and when you know that Ukraine does not forget about its cities and villages occupied by the enemy, just like about Kherson. The entire south of Ukraine learned last year that Russia never comes &quot;forever,&quot; no matter how many times they repeat it. Because Ukraine always returns – always! When we know our goal. When it&#x27;s a shared goal. When we are united. And when we unite others around the Ukrainian goal. Today is one of the anniversaries that shapes our Ukrainian confidence that we can. Thanks to the Kherson operation, the right bank of the Dnipro was cleared of the occupant. Our warriors then liberated a significant part of Kherson region, provided additional protection to Mykolaiv, Odesa, and other cities and villages in the south of our state, and solidified Ukraine&#x27;s success in the battle for the Black Sea. Crimea then in the smiles of the people of Kherson, in the words of joy when they welcomed our soldiers – Crimea also felt its future, saw how close we were. I am proud of all our warriors – all brigades, every battalion, all soldiers and commanders who fought last year. And everyone who is now leading our state through a difficult, painful, but essential – vitally essential! – marathon to the guaranteed freedom of Ukraine. Independence, which has the power to transcend from generation to generation, is truly achieved in battles, draws energy from the unity of the people, and fortifies its spirit precisely when it hears the gratitude of those liberated from the enemy – those who waited for Ukraine, and whose faith has been fulfilled. Dear people! Throughout this year, Russia has been seeking revenge for the freedom of Kherson and our other liberated cities. Daily shelling. Bombs, artillery, rockets... Just from yesterday evening until this morning, almost forty drones and rockets... Ballistic attacks against Kyiv, drones, and rockets against Odesa, Kharkiv region. Deliberate torture by the enemy. Every day! But not a single day of despair for us! None of us should underestimate the strength of the enemy against us. Ukraine knows that the enemy is not weak, restless. But Ukraine knows how to overcome it! Like last year, Russia seeks to destroy our country, our lives. Like last year, we must destroy the occupier. Ukraine is doing this... And today, dear Ukrainians, please thank those who have put their strength and lives on the line to defend Ukraine and Ukrainians. Those who are fighting now. Those on combat posts now. Those who are training to reinforce combat brigades. And those who are working now to ensure our soldiers have ammunition and weapons, armor and aviation, air defense and electronic warfare... So that we can provide protection to Ukrainians and so that Ukraine can reclaim freedom for its land. I thank everyone who is currently working in Kherson to protect our people! Thanks to all who are fighting on the left bank of Kherson region for the sake of Ukraine! Thanks to all who defend Ukrainian lives! Our lives will surely triumph. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our defense and security forces will respond to the Russian army&#x27;s strikes on Kherson and the villages of Kherson region – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-11</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Before the end of this day, a few important things should be said. First – about our Kherson. Today marks the anniversary of the liberation of the city, and I am grateful to everyone who remembers how the people of Kherson resisted the occupiers, awaited the return of the Ukrainian flag, and welcomed our soldiers. I thank everyone who today honored the memory of those who gave their lives for Kherson and for our entire state to be free. It is crucial to remember who and how fought for Ukraine, who and how saved lives and our country. I thank all journalists who remind us of this, and every person who preserves the memory of the liberation of Kherson and the bravery of its residents. On the eve, I signed a decree on state awards for soldiers and civilians who distinguished themselves there – in the defense of Kherson. Those who fought for the state. Those who assisted in resistance. Those who saved and continue to save lives. And those who are as courageous as the world now knows the courage of Ukrainians. Alongside our soldiers, the decree also honors local government officials. These are people who did not abandon their communities, helped defend against occupiers, assisted in resistance. They treated and continue to treat, organized assistance for those who could not take care of themselves, saved children from deportation, and rescued people from Russian terror. They are saving lives even now, under constant bombings and in the face of ongoing attacks. I thank all of you for your courage and dedication to your work and Ukraine. Thanks to each and every one who stays and works right there – in the communities along the front line. Of course, our security and defense forces will respond to the Russian army&#x27;s strikes on Kherson and the villages of Kherson region, just as it always happens. This week has shown that in the Black Sea, in the territory of Crimea, and anywhere else, we will reach the occupier. Glory to all our guys who are bringing justice back to Ukraine in this way! Secondly, there&#x27;s something important to say today. I spoke today with President Duda of Poland. A good conversation. I congratulated Andrzej and all Poles on the Independence Day of Poland. This day is as important for Poland as it is for us, Ukrainians. The history of our nations is intertwined, and in this, it reflects the restoration of independence in our states and how we now take care to protect it. Ukraine and Poland must stand together so that our people are always free. I thank Andrzej for his kind words today about Ukraine and Ukrainians. Thank you for the extremely valuable support that Poland provides to our state and people. And one more thing. We continue the evacuation of Ukrainian citizens from the Gaza sector. This work has been ongoing literally all day. The number of those successfully rescued changes almost every hour. Already 214 of our people. We are also assisting citizens of Moldova. We expect this number to increase. I thank Defense Intelligence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ukrainian embassies in the region, and all those who are helping us with this work. Today, I also held a meeting with international experts regarding negotiations and meetings that can strengthen Ukraine – both our defense and international attention to Ukraine. Every day we add strength to the state. Glory to our soldiers! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia is preparing for winter, and Ukraine should focus on defense and response to terrorists – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-12</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Every time another week of the war – our defense, our active steps – comes to an end, it is important to say one thing: thank you. Thank you to everyone who defends our country and gives Ukraine the opportunity to be truly Ukraine: itself, a vibrant and powerful country. It is important to thank everyone who fights for the sake of the state, everyone who helps fight and who champions Ukraine&#x27;s interests in the world. Everyone who trains our soldiers, who treats them, who develops our combat medicine and our military production, who provides our people with everything they need. We must always realize how many people are involved in the defense of Ukraine and Ukrainians. And each of these people is important, all of them together are the Ukrainian force. First of all, these are our warriors. Those who physically restrain the enemy, who destroy the occupier, who protect us from Russian missiles and drones. And today I would like to especially recognize the units of our National Guard of Ukraine, which are fighting alongside all defense and security forces. Fighting vigorously, strongly, and effectively. I thank you, warriors! The 3rd and 14th operational brigades of the National Guard, involved in the offensive in the south. The 12th brigade of the National Guard – the eastern direction. The guys are holding their ground and defending every meter of Ukrainian land. Thank you for your strength! Thank you for repelling the Russian assaults! The 4th operational brigade of the National Guard – fighting in the Bakhmut sector. I am especially grateful to the artillery and anti-aircraft gunners of the 4th brigade. Well done to you guys! And, of course, the Avdiivka sector: the National Guard&#x27;s special forces units are fighting heroically there alongside all our warriors. Thank you for your resilience, guys! It&#x27;s also important to remember the warriors and units of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, who are fighting alongside everyone else as part of the defense forces on the frontline, as well as protecting our border and ensuring the safety of border traffic. They are not often talked about, but they are also doing a great job. Donetsk region, Avdiivka sector – I thank the warriors of the Zhytomyr border guard detachment. Senior sergeants Nazar Siryi and Serhiy Solozhuk particularly distinguished themselves. Lyman sector – I thank the guys from the Izmail border guard detachment. And special thanks to Chief Sergeant Oleksandr Atmazhov and Senior Sergeant Yurii Panasenko. Thank you for your bravery! And the Dozor special forces unit, which performs missions in various areas. I thank all of you guys! I would also like to mention the border guards of the Sumy detachment – thank you for protecting us from saboteurs and for shooting down Russian drones! We are almost halfway through November and we must be prepared for the possibility that the enemy may increase the number of drone or missile strikes against our infrastructure. Russia is preparing for winter. And in Ukraine, all our attention should be focused on defense, on response to terrorists, on everything Ukraine can do to make it easier for our people to get through this winter and to increase the capabilities of our troops. I thank all our partners who have helped Ukraine with air defense. These are different countries: the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Norway, Italy, Romania, Sweden, the Netherlands, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Poland, the Baltic States and other countries. Patriot, NASAMS, IRIS-T, RAVEN, Hawk, and other systems. We can&#x27;t talk openly about everything now, but the Ukrainian sky shield is already more powerful compared to last year. It has greater capabilities, but unfortunately, it does not yet fully protect the entire territory. And we are working to make it even better. Every country, every leader who helps us bolster our air defense helps protect lives. And I urge all Ukrainians, all those whose voice is heard in the world, our journalists, all those who support Ukraine in the world, to help boost the defense. To help! We are capable of overcoming the most difficult challenges. But only together, in unity, when we take care of each other and when millions of people help their defenders and their country. It is imperative to be united and grateful. Glory to our people – the people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is a matter of principle for Ukraine to implement all seven recommendations of the European Commission and fulfill everything that is required at this point of our path to the EU – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-13</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! The key takeaways from this day. I met with the leader of the Crimean Tatar people Mustafa Dzhemilev – today is his birthday, he turned 80. A decent man, a brave man. A defender of his people and the whole of Ukraine. I awarded Mustafa Dzhemilev the title of Hero of Ukraine. I believe that it is absolutely well deserved. I also thanked him for what he has done for our people, for our freedom. He is truly a moral authority. I also thanked him for the fact that Mr. Mustafa-aga is now with us in the fight against Russian aggression. Of course, we talked about Crimea and the protection of our people on the peninsula. We are mindful of all parts of our country and must restore freedom for the entire Ukraine without exception. I thank everyone in the world who remembers that Russia&#x27;s attack on the rules-based international order began with Crimea. It was with the seizure of Crimea that Russia began this aggression and destabilization. And it is difficult to imagine a restored peace in the world unless we return to Ukraine what Russia has stolen. Restoring our territorial integrity is a global need. Today, I held a long meeting with diplomats, government officials, and representatives of the Verkhovna Rada to discuss our country&#x27;s preparations for the European Council&#x27;s political decision to start negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union. Our steps and our decisions. We are working to get an unconditioned decision to open negotiations. For Ukraine, it is a matter of principle to implement all the recommendations of the European Commission, all seven recommendations, and fulfill everything that is required at this point of our path to the European Union. The success of our country and people – economic, social, and success in building Ukraine&#x27;s relations with the world – can only be achieved as a common success of the whole of Europe. To this end, we are gradually strengthening our institutions and legislation, even during a full-scale war. And I am grateful to everyone who contributes to this, who endorses the relevant decisions, who puts them into action. Today, I also held several meetings on our next international steps planned for the coming weeks. Negotiations with the leaders of partner countries, new support packages for our warriors, and international communication of Ukraine. We can and must ensure an absolutely clear result: no matter what the information agenda of the world is, our partners must understand us and hear Ukrainians. And they will. There is important news from Romania: an F-16 pilot training center has started operations, our guys will undergo training there. I thank President Iohannis of Romania and Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands for ensuring the implementation of all our agreements. There were also intelligence reports today – by Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov and Chief of the Foreign Intelligence Service Lytvynenko. I am grateful to both of these agencies – to every single person serving there – above all, for the fact that Ukraine knows and will know the enemy&#x27;s plans and how to respond to them – properly and powerfully. Both on the ground and in the Black Sea. And, of course, the frontline. Avdiivka, Maryinka, Bakhmut direction, Lyman direction, Kupyansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region… It is challenging in each of these areas. But I thank everyone who is steadfast. I thank everyone who does not lose strength and positions. I thank all the commanders who care about the troops. I thank all the combat medics who save lives. I thank all our people who remember that Ukraine lives because there is someone to hold off the enemy. Glory to our warriors! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Each of our warriors holding positions near Avdiivka deserves our utmost gratitude – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-14</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A report for this day. First of all, our warriors. Today, the intelligence service, the Commander-in-Chief, the Security Service of Ukraine, and the Minister of Defense reported on the conference call. The overall situation at the front, particular directions. Ammunition, equipment – everything for the front. Avdiivka, Kupyansk, Bakhmut. Also the southern directions. Russian assaults are very intense, especially in Donetsk region. We have to realize that Putin has a very cynical and specific political goal right now, and he is willing to kill as many of his people as he needs to because he wants to show at least some tactical results in the first half of December. That&#x27;s when he plans to announce his elections. Russia is already losing soldiers and equipment near Avdiivka faster and on a larger scale than, for example, near Bakhmut. It is extremely difficult to withstand this onslaught. And each of our warriors holding the positions, each of our warriors performing combat missions there deserves our utmost gratitude. They are true heroes! The more Russian forces are destroyed near Avdiivka now, the worse the overall situation and the overall course of this war will be for the enemy. I would like to particularly recognize the warriors of the 53rd and 110th separate mechanized brigades and the artillerymen of the 55th separate artillery brigade. All of them are fighting in the Avdiivka sector and have provided Ukraine with the best results these days. Thank you, warriors! I would also like to recognize the brigades fighting in other areas that deserve our gratitude. This is the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade, whose warriors are defending the Kupyansk direction. They are very powerful. Thank you! My gratitude also goes to the 68th separate jaeger brigade in the Lyman sector. Well done, guys! And, of course, the Bakhmut sector. The artillery of the 26th brigade, the 92nd separate assault brigade and the 30th separate mechanized brigade. I thank you all, warriors! We continue to work with our partners, especially in the United States, to ensure that support for Ukraine is maintained at the level that is needed now. I am grateful to our partners for their understanding of Ukraine&#x27;s needs. These days, the Ukrainian delegation is in Washington. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, Head of the Office Andriy Yermak, representatives of the Ministry of Justice and our teams are advocating, among other things, for stronger sanctions against Russia and the use of Russia&#x27;s frozen assets to support our country. Important meetings took place: the U.S. Secretary of State and his team, national security advisors to the President of the United States and the leaders of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, representatives of American civil society, and heads of international financial and development institutions. We are preparing for the next year. It will not be easy. We are aware of this. But we are doing everything to ensure that Ukraine&#x27;s position remains solid. And in the coming weeks, respective work with European and other partners is planned. A few more things. Today, I will highlight the work of our entire team and those who helped to rescue Ukrainian citizens from the Gaza Strip. This is a very, very complex, sensitive, multi-level operation. More than 200 people have been rescued. We are preparing the next groups for evacuation. I want to thank everyone. I thank the Egyptian and Israeli authorities, Ukrainian diplomats who are involved and effective, SkyUp, which has been very helpful, and I would also like to personally thank Rabbi Jonathan Markovitch. And, of course, the officers of the Main Intelligence Directorate, who are performing the relevant tasks on the ground and here in Ukraine. Thank you all very, very much! Ukraine&#x27;s success in such operations once again demonstrates to the world how much our country values its citizens, wherever they are, and how effective our state institutions are. Today, I also held a meeting with international relations experts and government officials to prepare for the second summit of our globally important humanitarian initiative &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot;. Ukraine not only maintains its role as a guarantor of global food security. Our maritime exports through the new corridor have already reached almost 4 million tons of cargo. But we also remember that we can contribute to greater stability in the world by helping with food supplies to those in need. In particular, in Africa. We are uniting our partners around this humanitarian initiative. More news to come soon. And today I met with journalists from Africa - a large group... 11 countries of the continent, different parts of Africa, leading media. I thank you for your attention to Ukraine and I believe that the world majority will always be with Ukraine in its defense against aggression and in the defense of international law. Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine, who saves human lives! Thank you to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The potential of our communities, our intercity and interpersonal ties can add significant strength to our defense – speech by the President of Ukraine at the German-Ukrainian Municipal Partnerships Conference</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-15</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President! I thank you for your attention to Ukraine and support for our people, our country, and our relations. Ukraine and Germany have the best relations in the history of our states. And we appreciate that our relations yield real results in protecting human lives and our European way of life. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Federal Chancellor Scholz and the entire German government team. Our agreements with the Chancellor are being implemented clearly and on time. Thank you for that! And, of course, I thank the entire German people for their sincere support of Ukrainians and Ukraine in this confrontation that Russia started. Mr. Mayor Jung! Dear participants of the Conference! I recall in the fall of 2022, Mr. President Steinmeier visited Ukraine and in particular the village of Yahidne in Chernihiv region. One of the ordinary Ukrainian villages, which, unfortunately, had to go through extraordinary cruelty. For almost a month, while the village was occupied by the Russian invaders, they kept 350 villagers – in fact, all the villagers! – in a small basement of the village school. Both babies and the elderly, women and men. 10 people died during that time right in that basement. Mr. President Steinmeier saw the conditions and the contempt the Russians had for people in general that led to the creation of such a concentration camp in Yahidne. And yet this is more than the story of one village in Chernihiv region of Ukraine that suffered the brunt of Russian brutality. What happened in Yahidne characterizes the very essence of this war – the threat that the current Russian regime poses to many ordinary European towns and villages. Not only in Ukraine. Because not only Ukraine is in Russia&#x27;s imperial plans. At least all of Russia&#x27;s neighbors are under threat. Here at the Conference, we have representatives of very different cities and communities in our two countries. But no matter how different they are, they are united by one fundamental thing, namely, the attitude towards people. The European attitude towards people. In our cities and communities, there should be no place for the opposite attitude to people and life – anti-European attitude – that Russia demonstrates in the occupied territory of Ukraine. We value life. And that is why we protect it. And it is crucial that we use not only the tools available at the state level. The potential of our communities, our intercity and interpersonal ties can and should also add significant strength to our defense. I would like to note that since President Steinmeier&#x27;s visit to Ukraine last year, we have managed to almost double the number of intercity partnerships. Today we have 190 such partnerships. There are already 6 interregional partnerships. There is also German patronage over the restoration of Chernihiv region of Ukraine, the very region where the village of Yahidne, which I mentioned, is located. And I thank everyone whose efforts fill our partnerships with concrete content. I am grateful to such cities and communities as Eichenau, Augsburg, Bergisch Gladbach, Waldkirch, Hanover, Erlangen, Jena, Dresden, Cologne, Leverkusen, Nuremberg, Potsdam, Schweinfurt and many others that are already helping our cities directly. Specifically, they are helping with generators and other equipment that saves us from the consequences of Russian terror. Fire trucks, buses, and other equipment for our citizens. Together with German companies, modular towns have been set up for IDPs whose homes were destroyed by hostilities. We are working together with German cities, companies and foundations to modernize energy capacities in the regions of Ukraine. I thank you very much for this! I hope that the participation of Ukrainian mayors in this Conference will also be fruitful. We are facing the upcoming second winter of this war, as Mr. President said. Russia is now amassing missiles to strike Ukraine&#x27;s energy sector, as it did last year. Germany is already helping us with air defense systems and other means of physical defense of Ukraine. And at the same time, every agreement between the cities of our countries that is aimed at protecting people and lives will definitely serve to protect lives. I am sure that representatives of Ukrainian cities can also point to opportunities for joint economic cooperation existing in Ukraine today. Not only in rebuilding what has been destroyed by Russia&#x27;s aggression, but also in launching new businesses and creating new productive stories. Ukraine is now, against all odds, delivering economic growth of almost 5 percent per annum. This is a testament to how strong our way of life is and how much our people are capable of doing. I believe that relations between Ukraine and Germany will become one of the most reliable pillars of the entire Europe. A security, economic, and social pillar. And especially when Ukraine becomes a full-fledged part of the European Union. And I am proud of all the examples of our cooperation and sincerely wish success to all of you in developing relations between cities, between regions, between the self-government of our countries. The closer Ukraine and Germany are, the further away Putin&#x27;s insane goal of destroying normal human life in Ukraine and other countries in Russia&#x27;s neighborhood is from being realized. Germany, thank you once again for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia is still capable of doing evil; we must make our state stronger every day – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-15</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! It was a rough day. At night, there was a Russian missile attack on Selydove, Donetsk region. Right at residential buildings. Four missiles. There are dead. There are probably people under the rubble. The rubble is being cleared all day. All the wounded were provided with the necessary assistance. More than 20 houses were destroyed. Another Russian strike hit Zaporizhzhia region, also with missiles. Among the dead are rescuers. They arrived at the scene after the first hit and started helping. And then there was a second strike. My condolences to all those whose relatives and friends were killed by Russian terror. There was a lot of international communication today. Of course, first of all, about ways to provide more protection for Ukraine and all our people from these savages, from Russian missiles and shelling. I spoke with Prime Minister of Italy Giorgia Meloni. I thanked Italy for its principled and powerful assistance to our country, for the protection of Ukrainian lives. Ukraine greatly appreciates that Italy stands with us at this moment. We also appreciate Giorgia&#x27;s personal energy, all the activity of Madam Prime Minister, with which she advocates for assistance to our country. We discussed our security cooperation and support packages. We exchanged views on the situation in Europe and the world. We also discussed some issues related to the new EU sanctions package. Italy will preside over the Group of Seven next year, and we are already working on the relevant priorities. Common priorities. I spoke with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová. I expressed gratitude for the support and fair recognition of Ukraine&#x27;s success in getting closer to the European Union – in our movement towards full membership. It is very important for our entire Europe to become stronger, and every state on the continent that respects the common rules of the EU will benefit from this. We discussed preparations of our energy sector for the winter and, as we expect, for the intensification of Russian terror against energy facilities. Of course, we also discussed economic issues that are important to our nations. Today I also held talks with Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada. Defense support. Strengthening our air defense, our mobile fire groups and protection against Russian drones. There are specific agreements. I thanked Canada for its continued leadership in sanctions against Russia. There is a new and important Canadian initiative – a coalition of partners to return Ukrainian children who were deported to Russia. We also discussed the issue of completing the Holodomor Genocide Museum. Canada has agreed to help with this in Ukraine. I am grateful to Justin personally and to the entire Canadian society for such an understanding of Ukraine. I also held several meetings today. I would like to mention a meeting with representatives of the law enforcement sector, including the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine. He reported on counteracting collaborators and protecting Ukrainians from those who deliberately incite hatred within our country. I also had a meeting with the Minister of Defense and other government officials. All the key issues boil down to ensuring the protection of people, Ukraine&#x27;s ability to conduct offensive operations, and our ability to strengthen Ukraine – to overcome the accumulated problems. Everyone in Ukraine must remember, especially those who have stopped noticing the war because they are fully focused on politics: Russia is still capable of doing evil. No one will be able to turn a blind eye. We have to fight. We must keep our defense as a top priority. And we must make our state stronger every day. Glory to all those who care about Ukraine and Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization deserves to be restarted and revitalized – speech by the President of Ukraine at the PABSEC Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-16</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and gentlemen! Dear representatives of the Black Sea region! Today, the world already understands the importance of our region – the importance of the Black Sea. This is where one of the foundations of global security lies. And it is our peoples – our countries – together with our partners who are the guarantors of this security. We are capable of adding stability to the world and strengthening peace. And we are already doing it. One of the key elements of Russia&#x27;s aggression against the rules-based international order was its aggression in the Black Sea. It is here that Russia has been using its military foothold in our Crimea for years to undermine the normal life of different peoples... Russia used the Black Sea for its aggression against Georgia in 2008... To foment war and chaos in the Middle East – in particular, in Syria... It was with the seizure of Crimea that the hybrid war against Ukraine and the whole of Europe began... On February 24, with the outbreak of full-scale war, Russia attempted to turn our region and the Black Sea into a weapon, and not only against Ukraine. The aggressor needed the blockade of our ports and the deliberate destruction of our port and export infrastructure to destroy the global food market and thus provoke new outbreaks of chaos in different parts of the world. Thanks to our cooperation, all of this is being stopped. Please look at what we have achieved together during this time of full-scale war. We managed to show that cooperation between the nations of the Black Sea region, with the support of our partners, can bring stability back to the global food market. And thus, restore the security of normal life for dozens of nations – from Morocco to Southeast Asia. We managed to provide such a level of protection to the western part of the Black Sea, which now allows our maritime export corridors to work. The Danube region, which is also critical to global security, is gaining new significance. We managed to seize the initiative from Russia in the Black Sea and created security conditions that force the aggressor to flee the eastern part of the water area and try to hide warships. For the first time in the world, a fleet of naval drones – the Ukrainian fleet – began operating in the Black Sea. I would also like to point out that now, as one of the key results of our actions, Russia is unable to use the Black Sea as a springboard to destabilize other regions of the world. And I am grateful to all the leaders, states, and peoples whose activity helps protect the international order and guarantees more peace and security for the world. And I thank our neighbors in the region – Türkiye, Bulgaria, Romania, and Moldova – for supporting global security. I am confident that the restoration of a just peace and the dismantling of Russia&#x27;s aggressive presence, particularly in the Black Sea, will help Georgia restore its territorial integrity and create more guarantees for the national security of all the states of the Caucasus. The situation in the Black Sea region and the development of our cooperation have a direct impact on the growth opportunities for the Balkans and the Baltic Sea region. By overcoming Russian aggression, we are protecting all the peoples of the Baltic-Black Sea-Azov space and neighboring regions. So now – more than ever before – it is obvious that our cooperation in our Black Sea region should only increase. And I am grateful to everyone who adds to the joint results. Ladies and gentlemen! The Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization deserves to be restarted and significantly revitalized. This is the necessary format of work. And we all need it. It is important to create new lines of cooperation. It is important not to remain silent about Russian aggression and to limit the aggressor&#x27;s ability to put pressure on any of the peoples of our region. It is important to use this platform to bring the restoration of a real and just peace and the reintegration of the entire Black Sea into the global security and economic space closer. We are able to ensure this. But only together. And by restricting the aggressor. I thank you all for your support! Thank you for participating in the PABSEC Summit. And I wish you all peace. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I want to thank all our defenders of the sky: their result is a result for the whole country, it is a salvation for our people, for our cities – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-16</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! A few summaries of the day. First of all, I want to thank all our defenders of the sky who are on combat duty every night and every day. Overnight, we managed to shoot down 16 &quot; Shaheds&quot; alone. I thank all the pilots and engineers of the Ukrainian Air Force, all our anti-aircraft gunners and warriors of mobile fire groups. Every time they achieve a result, it is a result for the whole country. This is a salvation for our people, for our cities, for Ukrainian infrastructure. Of course, I also thank everyone in the world who helps. The geography of our cooperation for the sake of a sky shield for Ukraine is very extensive. Not everything can be told publicly now. But what is absolutely certain is that Ukraine is constantly getting stronger. Our air defense capabilities are increasing. Of course, this is not yet a hundred percent protection. There is a lot of work to be done. Cities like Kharkiv, regions like Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia need more systems, more security. This is the task of all our diplomats, of our entire state. I thank everyone who is effective in this. The second point for today. The Day of Radio, Television and Communications. A special day. It combines creative professions and a lot of technical and organizational work. It brings together those who are on and off camera. Those who are on the air and without whom no broadcast is possible. I congratulate the employees of the entire industry on this day and sincerely thank them for the fact that Ukraine was not left without information for a single day of the full-scale war. And communication – even when the occupiers disrupted it – was always restored. Under fire and in the de-occupied areas, in all cities and communities, there are always those who work for the sake of awareness of Ukrainians, for the sake of communication for our people, for the sake of the world knowing and understanding Ukraine and what we want. Today I held several meetings with media representatives. I met online with journalists, editors, producers – in general, with the employees of the channels that ensure the work of the United News marathon. This is a very important element of our unbreakability and our unity. I thanked them for this work, for their energy and efforts in raising awareness and protecting people from Russian disinformation in the interests of the entire society. I also met – offline, in person – with journalists working for leading foreign media, news agencies, English-language Ukrainian media and radio. It was a long, very productive and interesting conversation. I am grateful for every question, almost all of them were difficult. We will definitely do some of the things that the journalists talked about today. First of all, it concerns media access to the frontline – the opportunity to cover more frontline events. But, of course, all the other topics that were raised will be followed by the relevant decisions. One more thing. The new British Foreign Secretary, David Cameron, visited Ukraine. This is his first working visit in this position. A visit to Ukraine. I am grateful for the attention to our country, to our people and for this signal to the world. A signal that by helping Ukraine, you are helping global stability. We talked about the frontline, weapons for our warriors, some very important and sensitive issues of international relations. It was a good meeting. These days, an important international event at the parliamentary level took place – the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. The Summit is in Ukraine. I am grateful to the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk for organizing the summit. I addressed the participants. I believe that we should all pay more attention to what Ukraine has achieved in the Black Sea. Our country has fundamentally changed the situation in the Black Sea – Russia has lost control. And in general, it has lost hope of keeping the Black Sea for itself as a springboard for aggression against other nations. We will do everything to enhance this result. Glory to everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine and our independence! I thank everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Actively progressing with the United States on joint arms production – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-17</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! Today, I held a Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff meeting, with a detailed report from the Minister of Defense on the upcoming year, the provision of defense forces. Every direction and aspect – ammunition, weapons, equipment, and accoutrements. What is currently in short supply and what objectively needs to be increased, taking into account plans of our active actions. The Minister of Strategic Industries reported on our own production of weapons and ammunition – the goal of increasing production is being achieved. This is crucial, and I am grateful to all the workers in our defense industry, as well as our partners who assist. We also discussed the implementation of the Ukrainian missile program, initiated in 2021. Everyone can see that its results are becoming more long-range and favorable for Ukraine each year, and unpleasant for the enemy, as it should be. There will be even more results. By the way, we are actively progressing with the United States on joint arms production. During my visit to Washington, President Biden and I agreed on specific steps we can take together. This will undoubtedly strengthen both Americans and Ukrainians, as well as our partners. Joint production always enhances capabilities. In recent days, during negotiations involving Andriy Yermak and our government team, we discussed the specifics. In December of this year, a special conference involving Ukrainian and American industries, government officials, and other state actors will take place – everyone involved in organizing our defense. We are preparing a significant event, an extension of the Defense Industries Forum that took place in September. Now, it&#x27;s a forum in Washington and corresponding work on armaments in both Ukraine and the United States. I thank the United States – President Biden, his team, and Congress – both parties that support us. I also want to especially acknowledge U.S. defense companies and partners in Europe – all those who genuinely fill the concept of defending freedom with substance. During these times, we all need to be as effective as possible so that the lifetime of our children and grandchildren is not stolen by war. Today, there is also good news regarding defense packages for our soldiers – Finland has made a decision on a new package. Thank you for this. We have already received 20 support packages from Finland. All of them strengthen not only us but the entire eastern flank of Europe. Because when Ukraine is strong and independent, all of Europe can feel protected from Russian aggression. Important reports were presented at the Staff meeting regarding the situation on specific frontlines: Donetsk, Kharkiv, the southern directions. Reports were given by the Commander-in-Chief and Generals Syrsky, Tarnavsky, Moskaliov, and Sodol. I thank every one of our soldiers! Today, I issued a separate instruction to the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff regarding responding to the carriers of &#x27;Kinzhals&#x27; that disrupt our country for hours due to air alerts. Our air defense capabilities and overall readiness for missile threats allow us to modernize our response somewhat – without unnecessary interruptions to the country. This is important for millions of our people. I expect corresponding proposals. And one more thing. I started today with a special meeting with the Minister of Finance and government officials responsible for the education sector. Many sensitive issues, and millions of Ukrainian students are awaiting answers. This includes resources for scholarships and specific details about innovations in higher education. We also discussed everything necessary to strengthen vocational education in Ukraine. It was all very concrete, just as it should be on Students&#x27; Day. Of course, it would be right that most of what we discussed will be presented by the Minister of Education. Good things. We guarantee scholarships for students and are exploring opportunities to increase them. We will find resources for the reconstruction of universities damaged or destroyed by Russian attacks. Today, I visited one of the Ukrainian universities – Mariupol State University. It has been relocated to Kyiv and is working. Importantly, it preserves faith in Ukraine, in our people, and in the belief that Ukraine will be free – all of Ukraine. I spoke with the students. Thank you for your sincerity and energy. I wish all our Ukrainian students to be able to realize themselves in Ukraine, for Ukraine, absolutely dignified, modern, and beneficial to themselves and the country. To bring victory in this war, ensure security, and provide as much as possible protection to our people and our state... I thank everyone who fights and works for this. For our people. For our independence. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>More pressure on those who assist Russian terror, we will leave no connection of these people with Ukraine – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-18</span></div>
  <p>I wish good health to all Ukrainians! The main points for today. First, once again, I congratulate all Ukrainian sergeants and warrant officers on their professional day! I thank every sergeant and warrant officer who genuinely cares for the soldiers, supports the fighting spirit in their units, and knows how to be leaders for the troops. During the full-scale war, over 13,000 sergeants have been honored with state awards. Yesterday, I signed a decree to award another hundred Ukrainian sergeants – the best, the strongest. I am proud of you all. Second, for today. Several decisions on sanctions of the National Security and Defense Council have been put into effect. Almost 40 Russian legal entities and over 100 individuals, including those involved in the kidnapping and deportation of Ukrainian children from the occupied territory. Also, individuals who, in various ways, assist Russian terror against Ukraine. We are increasing the pressure of our state on them. Each of them must be accountable for what they have done, and we will not leave any connection of these people with Ukraine. Third, I want to acknowledge the countries that announced new assistance to our state this week. Germany, Finland, Lithuania – thank you for the new defense packages. Estonia – over the next few years, they will increase security investments in the production of ammunition. And this is important. Norway and the United Kingdom – decisions have been made on new humanitarian packages for Ukraine and Ukrainians. Thank you. We are already preparing new steps – security steps – in the coming weeks. This includes strengthening air defense. Another thing. Last night, almost 30 &#x27;Shaheds&#x27; were destroyed in our sky. I thank all the soldiers of mobile fire groups, the aviation of our Air Force, and the anti-aircraft missile troops. Your accuracy, guys, is literally life for Ukraine. As winter approaches, there will be more Russian attempts to make the strikes more powerful. It is crucial for all of us in Ukraine to be one hundred percent effective. Despite all the difficulties. Despite all the fatigue. Despite any attempts to weaken Ukraine. Respect and glory to everyone who fights for the country, everyone who helps and works to ensure that Ukraine can defend and protect its independence. It depends on everyone, on everyone who is resilient. On all who are effective. On each and every one who can add and adds strength and perspective to Ukraine. Please use every opportunity to strengthen the state. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>A fundamentally new level of medical support for the military is needed – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-19</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have an important personnel decision. Upon the submission of the Minister of Defense, I have changed the commander of the Medical Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Instead of Major General of the Medical Service Tetiana Ostashchenko, I appointed Major General of the Medical Service Anatoliy Kazmirchuk, Head of the National Military Medical Clinical Center &quot;Main Military Clinical Hospital&quot; in Kyiv, as the new commander. The task is obvious – and this has been repeatedly discussed in society, in particular in the community of our combat medics – a fundamentally new level of medical support for our military is needed. From high-quality tourniquets to full digitalization and transparency in supply, from high-quality training to sincere communication with combat medics in those units where medical care is organized truly properly and truly effectively. The experience of the effectiveness of specific units should be extended to the entire defense forces. Today, at a meeting with Defense Minister Umerov, we identified priorities, and there will not be much time to wait for results. Changes need to be made quickly. The second thing for today is that we continue to prepare for the planned international events this week. There will be an important activity – new communication with our partners. The key thing now is to make sure that support for Ukraine will be sufficient next year as well. I thank all the countries considering this issue in the same way as we do. This signal must be sent to Russia: no matter what they do, the world will not get tired of defending freedom and international order. I would like to recognize the Netherlands today – this week the Dutch government has envisaged more than 2 billion euros for the next year, mostly in security support for Ukraine. Thank you, Mark, Mr. Prime Minister, and I am also grateful to the entire Dutch society. This is a timely signal. It is important to feel that the defense of freedom is backed by reliable and sincere support. And one more thing. Every week that we pass in this war, in this defense of our independence, is a time when thousands of Ukrainians show the best of their character, the strongest qualities of people. When we are talking about unity in the defense of Ukraine, we are always talking not about something abstract, but about very specific things – about people doing what they have to do, what they should do, what supports others, and ultimately allows Ukraine to stand, fight, respond to the enemy and succeed in battles, in strengthening our state, in saving lives. Today I would like to recognize the employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine – those who save lives every day. Those who risk their lives. Those who were wounded by Russian shelling. I thank the entire staff of the State Emergency Service! And especially Sergeant Vladyslav Dordiy, Master Sergeant Oleksiy Suschevsky and Chief Sergeant Oleksiy Shabal – firefighters and rescuers working in Zaporizhzhia region. They were injured this Wednesday while providing assistance in the village of Zarichne. Guys, I wish you a speedy recovery! Thank you for your service. Donetsk region. Rescuers who have particularly distinguished themselves in helping people after the Russian attack on the town of Selydove. Sergeant Artur Taranenko and Captain Viktor Kartashov. Thank you! Kherson region. Sergeants Oleksandr Chastukhin, Yevheniy Tyshyk, Major Serhiy Kovalenko. They were repeatedly involved in the liquidation of the consequences of Russian strikes and always do their best to save as many people as possible. Well done, guys! Well done! Thank you very much! And, of course, Ukrainian medics. I thank all of you! I would especially like to recognize Tetiana Hurska, head of the Hulyaipole Emergency Department, and Oleksandr Ilyenko, an anesthesiologist at the Zaporizhzhia Emergency Station. Thank you! Kherson. Volodymyr Pyatyhorets, a surgeon who operated on 16 patients with mine-blast injuries this week alone. And Mykola Stepaniuk, a field feldsher of the Kherson emergency medical unit. He is actively working, actively helping, actively saving people. I am grateful to you and your colleagues who are equally active and caring! Separately I would like to thank everyone whose concern and efficiency help us return to Ukraine children who were abducted from the occupied territory. Today we managed to return to Ukraine Bohdan Yermokhin, a boy who was taken from Mariupol to Russia. There were many attempts to help him. I am glad that everything worked out. I am grateful to the entire team working on the return of Ukrainian children – the Office, the Ombudsman, and our international partners, including UNICEF. I am especially grateful to Qatar for its effective mediation and assistance. Thank you! We remember all our people. We are mindful of every corner of Ukraine that is currently under occupation. And I am grateful to everyone who is in combat, who is at combat posts, who is training and helping, who is preparing for combat! Avdiivka, Maryinka, our entire East, southern directions… Melitopol direction, Kherson region... Glory to all those who defend Ukraine, who defend independence, who care about people and sincerely try to strengthen us all! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world sees America&#x27;s strength in helping Ukraine – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-20</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! It was an eventful day. U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin paid a visit to Ukraine. The delegation also included Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Mr. Cavoli. It was a very productive conversation, and it is important that it took place on the eve of the new meeting in the Ramstein format. Of course, we discussed the situation on the battlefield and its prospects – how we can enhance both our defense and our advancement. There is a new defense package for our country from the United States. I am grateful for it. In particular, there will be more artillery – shells that are needed right now. We also discussed Ukraine&#x27;s actions in the Black Sea and the protection of our export corridor. Freedom of navigation is a fundamental value for the entire world, and Ukraine has proven here in the Black Sea that we are capable of driving the aggressor out of the water area that it wanted so badly to make dead. I am grateful to all partners who are helping us to ensure the real restoration of international law on our land and in our sea, and I am especially grateful to the United States for its continued leadership in support. Normal life in the world largely depends on whether America is strong in protecting life. And the world sees this strength in helping Ukraine. I held several important meetings today. The first one was about planning our international communication for the coming weeks. There will be relevant events. I also held meetings with the heads of the intelligence services – both the Main Intelligence Directorate and the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Both are working efficiently, and I am grateful for that. A meeting with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. Mostly about current issues – things that the government is currently implementing. But also about our relations with some partners. In particular, the Prime Minister reported on his talks with representatives of Bulgaria and Romania, which is clearly a growing area of cross-border cooperation. I am grateful to our partners. This includes the work of the maritime corridor, the Danube export cluster, and the overall trade turnover between our countries. With Romania alone, we see the potential to reach 4 million tons of trade turnover by the end of this year. This is very powerful and very supportive not only for our country, not only for jobs in Ukraine, but also for partner countries. The whole region grows when neighbors cooperate. I am sure we will expand our cooperation. Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, and the entire European Union are absolutely interested in making our ties stronger. Because later on, this strength is reflected in the growth of our ability to defend ourselves – to defend freedom. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! I thank everyone whose job is to make Ukraine, our people, and our children more secure. And I thank every Ukrainian soldier, every sergeant, every officer of the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine, everyone who defends the state and truly cares about human life! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine on the occasion of the Day of Dignity and Freedom</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-21</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainian people! European people! Today we celebrate the Day of Dignity and Freedom. It is a public holiday established in honor of the beginning of two revolutions – the Revolution of 2004 and the Revolution of Dignity 10 years ago. 10 years ago, we started a new page in the struggle. 10 years ago, Ukrainians launched their first counteroffensive. Against lawlessness, against the attempt to deprive us of our European future. Against our subjugation. 10 years ago, people united not only against something, but above all for themselves. Everyone for everyone. All those who after the arbitrariness of force felt that they are also being beaten, that they are also hurt, that these are blows to justice and truth, to freedom, to our common tomorrow. What will it be like if we remain silent, swallow it, and fear instead of fighting? And then, in fact, the first victory in today&#x27;s war took place. The victory of non-indifference. The victory of courage. The victory of the Revolution of Dignity. The victory of people&#x27;s resistance, civil society, the feat of the Heavenly Hundred Heroes and all those who fought for freedom in the capital and other regions. Our people have a long way behind them, which we have already passed. Behind me today are the flags of Ukraine and the European Union. And today we have the right to say: this is not just an adornment of the square, a decoration, a fiction, this is a real symbol of Ukraine&#x27;s inseparability from Europe, the right to which the Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian state have been proving all this time. Year after year, step by step, we do everything to ensure that our star shines in the circle of stars on the EU flag, which symbolizes the unity of the peoples of Europe. The star of Ukraine. 20 years ago it was a romantic dream, 10 years ago it was an ambitious goal, and today it is a reality in which it is no longer possible to stop our progress and completion of all mandatory stages. Therefore, our candidate status and further accession negotiations should certainly result in Ukraine&#x27;s full membership in the EU. And we are doing all this despite the war. When our people are defending themselves and Europe right now. Because we have dignity and we will not allow our freedom to be taken away from us. Because we have to protect our freedom in order not to lose our dignity. Because we know and remember one of the important wisdoms we learned long ago: how important it is not to be afraid, how important it is to fight. And every time they try to take something away from us, more and more people stand up to resist it. When the barricades of Maidan turn into the trenches of Donbas, and then into resistance along the entire frontline – north, south, and east. When the defense of democratic values turns into the defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity. When opposition to dictators inside the country becomes resistance to occupiers and terrorists from outside. When the whole country rises on February 24, when our entire nation rises to new barricades. Struggling and fighting. Knowing what for. Remembering everything. Having survived multiple &quot;winters on fire&quot;. Both 10 years ago and last year. Yesterday and today. We fought and we are still fighting. Both in the center of the capital back then and on the outskirts of Bakhmut now. On Hrushevskoho Street then and near Kharkiv, near Kherson, near Avdiivka now. All those who bravely went to battle for freedom with wooden shields back then, who defended the country in the first days of hostilities in the east, and all those who have been defending us in all directions since February 24. All those who were not afraid of rubber bullets or stun grenades then, or all the weapons and equipment of the so-called second army of the world today. Those who were not afraid and are not afraid to go out for freedom, wrapped in the Ukrainian flag. On Independence Square in Kyiv back then, on Freedom Square in Kherson last year. All those who selflessly pulled out the wounded on Instytutska Street back then, and all those who are doing it now on the battlefield. Everyone who knows and proves that we must struggle and fight – everyone for everyone. In every episode of confrontation. For one building or for the whole region. For one street or for the left bank of the whole country. For one barricade or along the entire state border of Ukraine. And today a new round of our history is being written. And today it is up to our generation to determine the direction it will take. What will be written about us in history books. What our descendants will say about us. &quot;They fought but failed&quot; or &quot;They fought and won&quot;? Like every state, ours has dark and bright pages in its history. Times of prosperity and times of discord. Periods of glory and periods of ruin. Which can last for decades. They can swing from side to side, like the history of the place behind me. From the middle of the XIX century, when European Square became Tsarskaya Square. And later - the Third International Square. And during the occupation, it was planned to be renamed in honor of Hitler. And even after the Nazis were expelled, it does not become European again, but turns into Stalin Square, and later Lenin Komsomol Square. And all this is not just plaques on buildings, it is the consequences that a wrong turn at the crossroads of history can have. When statesmen are replaced by windbag politicians. When they fight for chairs, not people, when their own egos become more important than their own country, when they do not stand up to the end and the prefix &quot;in exile&quot; is added to the status of &quot;leader,&quot; &quot;head,&quot; or &quot;hetman.&quot; When the enemy manages to split the internal unity. When we quarrel, and then get tired and desperate. And then we survive. In new periods of new captivity and statelessness. When the enemy manages to undermine international support and solidarity. When the civilized world begins to seek compromises with terrorists and make concessions to tyrants. Then we all definitely lose. Ukraine. Europe. The whole world. We lose, naively thinking that there can be a draw with them. A draw is impossible. We are strong. We have to be strong. Because people believe in the strong only, and only the strong create the future. Only the strong can be united. United to become free. Free to be worthy. For the sake of new times. When the central squares of our cities will receive new and forever unchanged names. In honor of the heroes. In honor of the liberators. Of Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol. In honor of the liberation of Donbas and Crimea. In honor of the reunification of Ukraine within its borders. When in history books, years and centuries from now, the period of independence since 1991 will be written about as a continuous one. Years and centuries from now. When listening about Ukraine as an integral part of Europe, all future generations will ask in schools: how could it have been otherwise? When in our calendar alongside the Days of Independence, Statehood, Unity, Dignity and Freedom, the Day of Victory appears. Victory of Ukraine. Of decent and free people. With a capital letter. Happy Dignity and Freedom Day, great people! Great with a capital &quot;G&quot;. Strong people of a strong country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukrainian people are able to achieve their goals when everyone is fighting for Ukraine – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-21</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I have just had a meeting with the German Minister of Defense, and today he visited not only Kyiv, but also the regions of our country to support our warriors and all our people. I am grateful for this. We have a new powerful package of support from Germany – defense support, one billion three hundred million euros, and, among other things, this package includes strengthening of our air defense, namely the production of new IRIS-T systems and missiles for air defense. Thanks to this, our cities, thousands of lives of our people will be saved from Russian terror. It is very important that this package also includes the artillery we need – a solid package indeed. Germany is among the leaders in helping our defense, our state and in preserving peace throughout Europe. We discussed with Minister Boris Pistorius the situation on the battlefield today, our cooperation, in particular in joint arms production – in everything that will help protect both Ukraine and our entire Europe. Today, President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of Moldova Maia Sandu visited Kyiv as well. On the tenth anniversary of the beginning of Maidan, this is especially symbolic. The main topic was our integration into the European Union, of both Ukraine and Moldova. Our country is doing everything necessary to actually start accession negotiations. All the decisions we had to make have already been made. And now we will even adopt the decisions that were supposed to be made by spring, that is, according to the schedule after the EU&#x27;s political decision to start negotiations. Ukraine has an absolutely clear position – to implement everything and be fully prepared for the start of negotiations, because for us it is all very concrete: every success of our country adds confidence and motivation to our people, to all those who defend Ukraine and help us. Today we have discussed the progress we are making, and of course it is very important that the European Union fulfills its promise by making a decision for Ukraine and giving us a start to negotiations. I am grateful to Mr. President of the European Council Charles Michel and all partners in Europe for their support – now is the time to strengthen solidarity. It was a good meeting with the President of Moldova – we discussed the whole range of our relations. We focused, of course, on how we can enhance our economies and our security. We talked about our exports, about cooperation in the Ukraine-Moldova-Romania triangle. I thank you, Maia, Madam President, for your sincerity and will to strengthen our relations. Ukraine and Moldova together – together with all our partners – can add growth and social justice to our countries and to our entire region. And one more thing. Today, here at the Mariyinsky Palace, I have honored our paratroopers with state awards - it is their professional day, the Day of the Air Assault Forces of Ukraine. Our strong warriors, our powerful combat brigades... I thank every warrior for everything you do for Ukraine and Ukrainians, I thank all the commanders who take care of the soldiers&#x27; lives, I thank everyone who helps to protect our country and people and who brings the expulsion of the occupiers closer. The Ukrainian people know how to achieve their goals. When we all fight for this – for the sake of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>A regular meeting in the Ramstein format was held, there are new packages of support for Ukraine and our warriors – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-22</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I have just spoken with Argentina&#x27;s President-elect Milei about how to make our relations – Ukraine and Argentina, Ukraine and Latin America – more active. I congratulated Mr. Milei on his election. I invited him to visit Ukraine, and it would be an important signal – a signal of non-indifference. Of course, I informed him about all we have already achieved in the implementation of our Peace Formula. I invited Argentina to show its leadership in joint peacemaking efforts. Today a regular meeting in the Ramstein format was held – the 17th one already. There are also new packages of support for Ukraine – for our warriors. These include shells and missiles, electronic warfare and drones, new capacities for our air defense. A corresponding coalition has been established – the air defense development coalition. The leaders in its organization are Germany and France. I am grateful for this leadership. I am also grateful to every country that participates in these efforts, which enable our cities and villages to be more protected from Russian attacks. Not everything can be said publicly yet, but Ukraine&#x27;s sky shield is getting more powerful literally every month. In the near future, I expect Defense Minister Umerov to report on the results of this Ramstein. I held a meeting today on our European and Euro-Atlantic integration. On what needs to be done now – by mid-December – for the European Union to fulfill its promise to start negotiations with Ukraine in response to our progress – to the fulfillment of all the recommendations of the European Commission. At this meeting, we also discussed how we are moving forward in our relations with NATO – in our integration into the Alliance. It was a fairly broad group of participants – all the sectors involved, all our institutions we expect activity from. The Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the Prime Minister, the relevant Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Head of the Office and his relevant deputies, as well as the Chief of the General Staff. First of all, we discussed the transition of our Defense Forces to NATO standards. In various spheres. Much has already been done. But procurement, planning, and many internal procedures deserve to be modernized. We also need to take the steps that our warriors are waiting for. There is also a clear commitment of the Ministry of Defense to the relevant decisions. There is also good, meaningful communication with partners in the Alliance – we are truly working together to further strengthen our Euro-Atlantic community. As for the European Union, today we agreed on a list of measures and steps that can add the necessary unity to the European community. Most of our partners clearly see our progress – Ukraine&#x27;s full implementation of all recommendations. We are also implementing now what we could have done closer to spring, according to the agreed plans. Everyone in the EU needs to see how serious Ukraine is, how clearly we are doing what is required. And one more thing. Today, the usual morning conference call featured several important reports. The work of our export corridor has yielded positive results, with almost 5.5 million tons of cargo already shipped. Africa, Asia, Europe – from Spain to China. I thank everyone who ensures safety in the Black Sea and who works in our ports. Today we also heard reports from the military on the situation on the frontline. In all those areas where it is particularly difficult now. The Kupyansk, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Maryinka sectors. I thank each of our soldiers, sergeants and officers whose resilience is now protecting the whole of Ukraine, each of them who is destroying the occupiers with power and courage. The 14th, 53rd, 110th separate mechanized brigades and the 57th and 59th separate motorized infantry brigades should be especially recognized for their results these days. Warriors, I am proud of each of you! I am grateful for your strength! I thank everyone in our society who helps the Defense Forces, who works to make the whole country stronger, and who does not forget that the success of Ukraine is the success of people&#x27;s resistance, people&#x27;s defense, our maximum unity for the sake of defense and freedom for the whole of Ukraine, for all Ukrainians. Anyone who adds to Ukraine&#x27;s confidence, anyone who adds to Ukraine&#x27;s results, adds to the guarantees of our independence as well. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine complements international sanctions mechanisms with its own sanctions – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-23</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, there are several new sanctions decisions by our state – two packages of sanctions. This is synchronization with partners regarding those individuals who directly work for or assist Russian aggression. It also means sanctions against the entities of the terrorist state related to critical infrastructure. Each name, each company name is a specific guilty party to the fact that Russian terror continues. Ukraine complements international sanctions mechanisms with its own sanctions. And we are working to ensure that the sanctions of our partners are extended to those against whom Ukraine has already made appropriate decisions. Today I signed decrees on more than 300 legal entities and almost 150 individuals of the terrorist state. And our special services, first of all the Security Service of Ukraine, as well as the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Security and Defense Council, will continue their work. There will be other sanctions decisions. There were several important reports today. In particular, on eliminating the consequences of Russian strikes. In different regions. Thousands of people are working in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Donetsk and Kharkiv regions in utilities, in the State Emergency Service, in medical services, as volunteers to help people and preserve our infrastructure – the essentials for a normal life. I am grateful to each and every person who provides medical care to Ukrainians, who works to extinguish fires after shelling. I thank everyone who restores electricity and water supply, who clears unexploded ordnance and demines the area. All of this is a special kind of courage and dedication, and I am grateful for it. Today I would like to recognize the employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Nikopol. Russian troops are bombarding the city almost every day. And every day our people are there to save lives. Captain of the Civil Defense Service Mykola Tkach, Senior Lieutenant Bohdan Tarasiuk, Master Sergeants Oleksandr Bilokon and Oleksandr Zhur, and Sergeant Maksym Preyda. I thank you guys, all your colleagues, and everyone who helps. I would also like to recognize the rescuers who work in Odesa region. Master Sergeants Serhiy Herasymenko, Serhiy Tsymbalystyi, Vitaliy Labutin, Chief Master Sergeants of the Civil Defense Service Ihor Yatsenko and Oleh Shmidt. I thank you, all your colleagues, for efficiency and consistently courageous work. Of course, I was in touch with the commanders. Maximum attention is paid to Donetsk directions. In particular, Avdiivka. Also Kharkiv region and Kupyansk direction. I am grateful to everyone who is resilient and holds our positions – every soldier, every sergeant, every commander. Today there was also a report from the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine – there are new results in countering enemy operations and collaborators. These are important results, and I am grateful for them. I thank everyone who cares about our country, everyone who fights and works for Ukraine and Ukrainians, everyone who adds their strength to the common strength of our country. The people that is fighting will definitely survive. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>A portion of today&#x27;s Staff meeting was devoted to a complex of issues for which our soldiers and society expect fair answers – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-24</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, dear Ukrainians! Just concluded negotiations with the President of Latvia. It was a substantive conversation. We talked about the defensive support for our state, for our soldiers. About the sustainability of such support. In particular, we discussed the production and supply of ammunition – 155mm artillery – as well as the issue of medevac – special armored vehicles for evacuating our wounded soldiers. I am grateful to Latvia for its unwavering support for our European prospects – all the work towards the start of negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the European Union. Today, I informed Mr. President about our country&#x27;s implementation of the European Commission&#x27;s recommendations and our readiness for a political decision in December, as promised by the European side, opening the negotiation process. We expect this decision and the fulfillment of the European Union&#x27;s promise. We discussed in detail with Mr. President mechanics of preparing the relevant EU decision. I also spoke today with Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Thanked him for the support provided to Ukraine, for the recent decision on an additional EUR 2 billion for the next year. This is an important signal for other partners. Protecting our European way of life must continue, and unity in Europe is a key element for this. Mark and I also discussed our joint work on the Peace Formula, as well as important humanitarian initiatives like our Grain from Ukraine program. We are working together to preserve stability in critical regions of the world and thus protect our continent from waves of crises. Today, I chaired an important and challenging meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff. Concerning not only the current situation on the front, although that was, as always, one of the main points. Our defensive, our offensive actions. Avdiivka, Donetsk direction, Maryinka, Kupiansk direction, southern directions. A significant part of today&#x27;s meeting was dedicated to a complex of issues for which our soldiers and the entire society expect fair answers. This includes mobilization and demobilization, rotations in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Issues regarding conscripts who were called to service before the start of the full-scale invasion. Of course, special attention was given to the situation with the work of the medical military commissions and military enlistment offices. What soldiers talk about, what commanders discuss must be resolved. Today, there were initial reports on this from Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, Minister of Defense Umerov, Minister of Internal Affairs Klymenko, Minister of Health Liashko, and Chief of the General Staff Shaptala. I expect a more thorough analysis of each of these issues by both the government and the military and concrete proposals for state decisions. I thank everyone who cares about Ukraine and Ukrainians! I thank each and every one who fights for the country and works for Ukrainian interests! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address of the President of Ukraine on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holodomors</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-25</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Dear people! Every year at the end of November, a cold shiver runs down our spine. Regardless of the weather conditions and our location. With coldness in our hearts we are all united by a tragic date - the fourth Saturday of November. The Holodomor Remembrance Day. When we feel great pain and anger at the same time, as it is impossible to forget, understand, and especially forgive the horrific crimes of genocide that the Ukrainian people experienced in the XX century. Men, women, children. Millions of innocent and murdered. Uncounted and countless. Uncounted at the time. When anything but the truth was written in the &quot;cause of death&quot; column. They callously &quot;wrote off&quot; thousands of people, did not consider it necessary to count, did not consider people as such. Countless in total. How many of them, starved to death, simply fell in the field, on the road, in their own yard? How many were not found? How many were not searched for? When the rulers had one need: for everyone to keep silent, and the relatives had neither the ability nor the energy to search for and prove the truth, and then there was no one left to search. How many are there? No one knows the exact answer to this question. Just like the answers to other questions. How can one want to kill an entire people? To wipe out an entire nation? How can one take away the very last from people? The last food, the last means of subsistence, the last hope for life and the last chance for salvation? Normal people cannot imagine or understand this. But there is something we know for sure. They tried to exterminate us, to subjugate us, to torture us. They failed. They wanted to conceal the truth from us and hush up the terrible crimes forever. They failed. They wanted to confuse us, to mislead us, to make us not believe, to doubt, to forget, and therefore to forgive. They failed. And today, with utmost sorrow and respect, we honor the memory of millions of our people. Today, as always, at 4 p.m. sharp, we will light the Candles of Remembrance. Many will be with their families, their children and grandchildren. Some of the young Ukrainians will see this candle for the first time. They will ask about it. And we will tell them the story. This candle will tell them a story that they should know, remember, and pass on to their children and grandchildren, who will tell it to their children and grandchildren. And as long as we keep lighting this fire, the memory of millions of our ancestors will not fade. Who were deliberately, premeditatedly and cynically pushed into the embrace of starvation. Because they were Ukrainians. Because they posed an ideological and class threat to the imperial entity, were free people in spirit, and therefore considered dangerous to the regime and its geopolitical intentions. And then, armed groups went from house to house and took away everything that could be eaten. And then the peasants fell to their knees, begging to leave at least some crumbs for their children, but the savages were ruthless. And then grandparents, parents, and relatives quietly &quot;faded away&quot; in front of their families, refusing to eat &quot;so that the children could have more.&quot; And then entire families, generations, streets and villages disappeared. A tragedy with not only millions of dead, but also millions of unborn. A tragedy that today makes us cry and remain silent, so quietly that the whole world must hear it. This is the sound of Ukrainian pain. The ideologues, organizers, and perpetrators of those crimes have not been held accountable or punished fairly during their lifetime. But this does not mean that we should forgive and forget. Today, the names and biographies of all the perpetrators must be brought to justice. And they bear the punishment of shame, the stigma of their role in world history, the truth that everyone on the planet should know. The truth that today is the least that can be done to honor the millions of victims. Recognizing those terrible acts against Ukrainians as crimes of genocide is extremely important. This is not a formality. This is the attitude of the civilized world to the truth. This is a tribute to justice. We thank all the states that have chosen justice and recognized it. Recognized it officially. Recognized the Holodomor as a crime against people, against history, against Ukraine. A deliberate crime. Exactly 30 years ago, Estonia and Australia were the first to do so. Then Canada, Hungary, and Vatican City did the same. Lithuania, Georgia, and Poland followed. Peru, Paraguay, Ecuador, Colombia, and Mexico. Portugal and the United States of America. And when the war broke out, everything became clear to all those who had been in doubt. Everyone saw literally, live, in real time, what modern Russia, which calls itself the successor to the USSR, is capable of. Which enjoys being the heir to the worst crimes and murders of that era. Exactly murders. Attempts to destroy nations. And during these 2 years of full-scale war, almost as many states as since the beginning of our independence have now recognized the Holodomor as genocide. Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Brazil, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Iceland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia, The European Union and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Justice is spreading around the world. The world needs to know about it, the world needs to recognize it, the world needs to remember it. I thank everyone who, together with Ukraine, restores historical truth and justice. Who calls a spade a spade. And who does not allow the names of those guilty of genocide and war crimes to hide behind the lie of alleged non-involvement. 90 years ago, the world could not fully see what was really happening. Now there are no those who do not see. There are only those who choose not to notice. They are few. And there will be even fewer. The truth paves the way. On this path, the world must unite and condemn the crimes of the past. The world must unite and stop the crimes of the present. In the last century, famine came from Moscow. Now we hear words of denial from there. And every one of these words of denial actually sounds like a confession - they need famine as a weapon for the future. Famine, cold, terror. Every ton of grain they have stolen now, the blockade of each of our cities, every Russian strike against our ports, against Ukrainian grain storage facilities and elevators, every &quot;Shahed&quot; that targets our logistics, and every Russian missile whose trajectory is against Ukrainian life is all the past that has returned since it has not been condemned in time. This is a process where the line of totalitarian Soviet policy and the line of modern Russian policy form the equals sign together. Evil was not stopped. Was not atoned for. And now we are stopping it. This is a time of historical responsibility for the murderers and for those who chose to be followers of the murderers, who act in the same way as before. And justice is important not in 90 years, but now. Because although there are crimes that have no statute of limitations, justice must be timely. The sentence for evil must be timely. Justice needs living witnesses. Those who will see the Russian evil punished. And those who will tell not only about what our people went through, but also about how our people put a just end to the attempts to destroy Ukraine, to torture, subjugate or exterminate it. Ukraine will prevail. Ukraine will not fade away. Ukraine will preserve itself and the truth. And justice. And the words of one of the most famous novels about the Holodomor, The Yellow Prince: &quot;Their evil will perish, but the truth will never&quot; will become the living witnesses and the living truth of Ukraine, which endured. May we always remember all our people who died in 1921, 1922 and 1923. In 1946 and 1947. And in the most terrible years of 1932 and 1933, the years of the Holodomor genocide. May the warmth from millions of candles of remembrance warm millions of their souls. May they all rest in peace!</p>

  <h2>We cannot stand aloof from Ukraine’s defense, and glory to all our people who understand this – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-26</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today, a considerable part of our country is facing extremely difficult weather conditions. The situation is particularly difficult in the southern regions of Ukraine. Our units of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the National Police, utilities and local authorities are working around the clock and will continue to do so. I ask all Ukrainian citizens in the areas affected by the bad weather to be as cautious as possible. If necessary, please contact the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the National Police, and our other state and municipal agencies. Our power engineers will restore electricity supply to all cities and villages that are currently experiencing temporary power outages due to the weather as soon as possible. As of now, these are about 400 settlements in ten regions. In particular, operational headquarters have already been deployed and are currently functioning in Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kirovohrad, Cherkasy, and Kyiv regions. Special vehicles have been deployed to the roads where needed. I would like to thank everyone who is working now and will continue to work tomorrow to protect us from this bad weather and to restore normal living conditions in all our Ukrainian communities as soon as possible. Now, when it is so difficult, in such conditions, we should all be especially grateful to those who defend our country, who carry out Ukrainian offensive operations, who are in combat positions, at combat posts, on duty in mobile fire groups and in all our other units that protect Ukraine, the life of our state and our independence. Intense hostilities do not stop for a single hour in the Donetsk directions and in Kharkiv region – in the direction of Kupyansk. Our warriors are also holding their positions in the south of the country: Zaporizhzhia region, our Kherson region. I want to thank everyone who rightly responds to Russian terrorist attacks, who repels enemy assaults even now – in such conditions. Soldier Oleh Danylchenko, a combat medic of the 110th separate mechanized brigade, Senior Soldier Oleksiy Tokariev and Junior Sergeant Mykola Tyshchenko, both of the 53rd separate mechanized brigade, Senior Soldier Yaroslav Bazil and Junior Sergeants Ihor Ponomarenko and Serhiy Kashyrin, all three of the 118th separate mechanized brigade, Soldier Andriy Shabelnyk of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade, Sergeant Andriy Tarhoniy of the 80th separate air assault brigade, Junior Sergeant Ihor Shapran of the 92nd separate assault brigade, and soldier Oleksandr Voronenko of the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade particularly distinguished themselves this week. I thank each of you, warriors, all your brothers-in-arms, everyone who helps our brigades, all Ukrainian defense and security forces, who works in our defense production facilities, who supplies everything needed by Ukraine and our people, who tends the wounded, trains our warriors, and organizes volunteer fundraisers for the sake of Ukrainian strength. We cannot stand aloof from defense. And glory to all our people who understand this, who fight, who work and help for the sake of Ukraine and Ukrainians! We are strong in unity. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No one in recent decades has caused greater harm to free navigation than Russia – address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the 33rd Assembly of the International Maritime Organization</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-27</span></div>
  <p>Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! I am glad to welcome you from Ukraine. And I am glad to have the opportunity to affirm that we, Ukrainians, together with our partners have proved that freedom of navigation is and will remain steadfast. No matter how powerful the force that seeks to destroy freedom of navigation is, the power of cooperation between nations is always stronger – always. I am sure you are aware of the situation in the Black Sea. It is in these waters where freedom of navigation has suffered the greatest blow since the Second World War. And it happened due to the fault of one state and its unprovoked war of aggression. On the very first day of the full-scale war, Russia blocked our ports on the Black Sea, disrupting our maritime trade routes. This led to enormous negative consequences – first of all, in terms of food security in the world. The food export from Ukraine affects the lives of about four hundred million people in different parts of the world – in Africa and Asia. The poorest nations, and those whose social life is stable, but unfortunately at any moment can be hit by chaos due to the food shortage on people’s tables. We have overcome this threat. First, we have restored the operation of some of Ukraine’s seaports, and it is a great joy for every nation to see ports return to normal operation. I invite representatives of all respectable members of the International Maritime Organization to our city of Odesa and other port cities of the Odesa region. So that you can see with your own eyes what difficulties our people have overcome. How many missile and drone attacks Russia has carried out against our infrastructure. Only on the night of this Saturday, when Ukraine honored the victims of a large-scale man-made famine, the Holodomor genocide, organized by Moscow 90 years ago, the Russian army used against Ukraine 75 “shaheds” – killer drones. Russia uses hundreds of such drones and at least dozens of missiles every month. And I am grateful to all the partners who help Ukraine with air defense. Despite all odds, we were able to release hundreds of ships with cargo for such countries as Nigeria and Libya, Morocco and Yemen, Bangladesh and China, and dozens of others. I believe that this Organization, the International Maritime Organization, as an institution that was established for global maritime security, should pay much more real attention to the safe functioning of the seaports of our country and all those regions where there-is or might-be aggression. Secondly, one of the first achievements of Ukraine and the entire international community in maritime security was the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which we launched together with the United Nations and Türkiye. However, even this exceptionally peaceful initiative, which was positive for the global market and was mediated by the UN, was destroyed by Russia. This terrorist state is interested in only one thing – to make everything a weapon for it, food shortages and anything else. If it were not for the courage and skill of our soldiers, the Black Sea would be literally a dead sea in terms of threats to free navigation. The Russian Navy has repeatedly attacked ports and civilian vessels in this area. But now Russia’s capabilities are much more limited – we have driven its navy away from our part of the sea. And this allowed us to launch new alternative routes in the Black Sea – almost six million tons of cargo have been transported in less than three months. Third, Ukraine never complains about difficult circumstances, but always offers solutions that can be useful to everyone in the world who values proper international relations. In response to the Russian aggression, we have proposed a comprehensive Peace Formula, which includes, among other things, ensuring the world’s food security. And this is simply impossible if current or potential aggressors consider the sea as a space for war. Anyone who tries to destroy the fundamental principles of navigation must be held accountable. The freedom of the seas is one of the key freedoms that allowed humanity to advance. We must defend it together. And now I want to reiterate Ukraine’s gratitude to all those member states of the International Maritime Organization that have already joined our global work to implement the Peace Formula and participated in the respective meetings in Denmark, Saudi Arabia and Malta. I invite all other states of the world that respect international law to join our work. I also urge you to prove at the level of this Organization that no destroyer of freedom of navigation will go unpunished. Russia has no place in the International Maritime Organization, nor in its governing bodies, because no one in recent decades has caused greater harm to free navigation than Russia. It must be held accountable for this, and such accountability of the aggressor will guarantee the preservation of global trust in our Organization. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>It is important for every community to do everything possible now to avoid casualties due to bad weather – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-27</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! A few results of the day. First. Since this morning I have been receiving reports on the situation in our regions affected by the bad weather. Almost 1,500 settlements in 17 regions were cut off from electricity. Power engineers are working everywhere to restore electricity supply. As soon as it is possible, electricity will be restored in every city and village. At the moment, hundreds of people and hundreds of vehicles of the State Emergency Service alone are working around the clock. The National Police and the National Guard are also helping. Public utilities are involved as well. I am grateful to everyone in the regional and local authorities who promptly joined in to help people and gives results. In every community, it is important to do everything possible to avoid casualties due to bad weather. Unfortunately, as of now, there are casualties. The highest number is in Odesa region – five people died. My condolences to the families and friends. At least 19 people were injured. Everyone has been provided with the necessary assistance. Operational headquarters at both the national and regional levels will continue to work until the situation is normalized. The epicenter of the cyclone is now moving to the northern regions – we are ready to help everywhere. There were also reports on helping drivers on blocked roads. I am grateful to the volunteers who support people in the communities. It is very important to take care of those who live alone, to help the elderly. Today I would like to recognize the entire staff of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the National Guard and the National Police. They provide assistance around the clock. In particular, the emergency workers of the Odesa region. These days, Captain Serhiy Lisin, head of the guard of the 45th state fire and rescue unit, Master Sergeant Ruslan Buhayev, driver of the 7th state fire and rescue unit, Master Sergeant Petro Kalaman, electrician driver of the rescue department of the 20th state fire and rescue unit have particularly proven themselves. And also the national guardsmen: Soldier Serhiy Dimov, Captain Serhiy Melnyk and Colonel Volodymyr Lytvyniuk. I thank you and all your colleagues for helping people! I also had important international conversations today. In particular, with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. We discussed the situation in the Middle East, current events and prospects. We also spoke about the development of our bilateral relations and joint work for the full implementation of the Peace Formula. Saudi Arabia has been very helpful in this area, and I am grateful for that. I also spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Of course, we talked about the European Union&#x27;s preparation of a decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine – we are doing everything our country has to do. We also talked about the continuation of the EU&#x27;s support for our country next year. Also today, I addressed the participants of the session of the International Maritime Organization, one of the most respectable institutions in the world that deals with security – maritime security. I informed them about Ukraine&#x27;s successes in the Black Sea – what Ukrainians have done to restore normal sea routes in the Black Sea. I thanked for the support of our efforts and called for bringing Russia to a just and well-deserved accountability for its aggression and terror, for violating all the fundamental freedoms and rules that underpin the international order. Today I also held a preparatory meeting on various international events planned for the coming weeks and until the end of the year. We clearly see the Ukrainian perspective and what is needed to achieve our goals. Every day we work with our partners to provide new defense support packages for our warriors. I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers and officers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with state awards – 115 servicemen. In total, 64,258 servicemen from all the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine have received state awards since February 24 and up to now. Massive bravery, massive resilience, massive determination to ensure that Ukraine gains the upper hand in this war. I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine and Ukrainians! I thank all the commanders who care about the lives of soldiers! I thank everyone who is focused on making our country stronger – our entire country. You cannot win this battle alone – we can only do it together, everyone who cares about one another and Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are preparing some serious long-range stuff to make sure the occupiers feel the might of Ukraine – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-28</span></div>
  <p>I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! I have just held a special, lengthy and detailed meeting of the Staff. First up – fortification. We are significantly enhancing our fortifications. There were detailed reports at all levels: The General Staff, the Ministry of Defense, the Prime Minister, regional authorities, commanders of the operational and strategic military formations. All finances are available. All decisions are in place. There should be comprehensive corresponding work in the communities. Everything is fully itemized – our country will definitely have enough mines and concrete. We need greater speed and efficiency, and everyone who is responsible for this has clear tasks. There was also an important analysis of recent attacks against Ukraine – missiles, massive drone strikes. We analyzed the tactics of our air defense. There is a clear need to develop and reinforce our mobile firing groups, as well as to get all highly effective air defense systems. We separately reviewed the work of Patriots and NASAMS – everything is highly effective, and I&#x27;m grateful to the partners who assist us specifically with these systems. The Air Force Commander and other relevant commanders, as well as the Ministry of Defense have been given the necessary instructions. There were, of course, reports from commanders on all fronts. Special attention was paid to the Donetsk directions: Avdiivka, Maryinka, and the Bakhmut area. Over the last 24 hours, the most intense hostilities were observed there. I thank all our warriors for their strength and resilience. The Kupyansk direction – I want to particularly highlight the holding of our positions there. We also discussed our actions on the southern fronts. Today, I held a separate meeting with the Minister of Strategic Industries of Ukraine, and I can say it was optimistic. We&#x27;re preparing, among other things, some serious long-range stuff to make sure the occupiers feel the might of Ukraine. And one more thing. I have signed the law of Ukraine on the state budget for the next year. It&#x27;s evident that its main priority is protection against Russian aggression. However, we&#x27;re also taking into account the social needs of our people and fulfilling our country&#x27;s social obligations in full. During full-scale war, it&#x27;s incredibly important that every citizen in need of state support receives it. And everyone who is currently creating jobs, who is preserving businesses and even developing them, everyone who is in Ukraine and with Ukraine, working honestly and supporting others – they all support our defense and our progress towards Ukrainian goals. To protect and strengthen our independence, to protect our people, to restore normal, decent living conditions – to the maximum extent possible. I thank everyone who fights and works for this cause! Glory to all Ukrainian warriors! Glory to our powerful people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In all regions, it is crucial to have a number of &quot;Points of Invincibility&quot; sufficient for any emergency situation – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-29</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! Today is entirely dedicated to our southern regions. First, Odesa and the region, then Mykolaiv, and afterwards, Kherson. Many issues were raised, almost all of them concerning security, protection of our state and people. Odesa - a meeting with the military. Air defense for the city, for the region, for Ukrainian Black Sea ports, our export corridor. I want to thank everyone who defends the region and works to increase air defense capabilities in the south. Today I had the opportunity to present state awards to the most distinguished warriors. I held a detailed meeting with the heads of all those regions that were most affected by severe weather. These include Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kirovohrad, Cherkasy, Poltava, and Kyiv regions. Government officials reported – the Ministers of Internal Affairs, Energy, and Infrastructure. I want to extend my gratitude to everyone who has been working these days to restore traffic on roads and electricity supply. To all the rescue teams of the State Emergency Service, National Police, National Guard, municipal services – thank you all. I instructed to increase the number of repair crews and equipment to promptly restore electricity supply to people. If necessary, the State Emergency Service personnel and power engineers from other regions that have not experienced such problems with the weather will be brought in. In all regions, it is crucial to have a number of &quot;Points of Invincibility&quot; sufficient for any emergency situation, whether related to weather or security. Regarding heat supply in Odesa. The regional authorities are ready to help the city with everything it needs to repair the boiler facility, which was damaged due to inclement weather. I also visited the center for IDPs in Odesa. In particular, for our citizens who were evacuated from the Gaza Strip. I am grateful that people are really taken care of. Mykolaiv. Meeting with our Danish friends who are working in the city to restore it. It&#x27;s a genuinely effective patronage we&#x27;ve agreed upon – Ukraine and Denmark. There were also representatives from the diplomatic corps of the countries we invited to join the recovery and patronage programs. I am grateful for such attention to Ukraine, for such belief in Ukraine. I had a very emotional and important meeting with students from three Mykolaiv universities. The universities that are working and the students that are studying – in Ukraine. For the sake of Ukraine. Adult questions. Honest emotions. Clear, bright eyes. Boys and girls, I thank you for this conversation today. We are doing everything so that our entire state, all our people, become stronger and always remain free. And finally, Kherson. Protection of the city, protection of the region. Local officials presented the results of the construction of shelters. The plans that are yet to be implemented. I held a very substantive and detailed meeting with the military concerning operations specifically in the south. We discussed what is necessary, agreed on goals, and have a clear vision of priorities in communication with partners regarding supplies. I thank everyone who cares about our country and our people! Thank you, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kherson. Thank you for this day. Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We discussed mobilizing resources for fortification works: the priority is clear – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-11-30</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I have just held two important meetings in Zaporizhzhia. An operational one with the military, with Generals Tarnavskyi, Moskaliov, Litvinov and all those responsible for defense here in Zaporizhzhia region. The second meeting was actually a nationwide meeting on fortifications. In all major areas where we need to boost and accelerate the construction of structures. Of course, these are primarily Avdiivka, Maryinka and other areas in Donetsk region that will receive maximum attention. Kharkiv region – the direction of Kupyansk, as well as the Kupyansk – Lyman defense line. The entire Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Rivne, and Volyn regions, as well as the south – Kherson region. There were reports from regional authorities, all the relevant military commanders. Defense Minister Umerov, General Pavliuk. We discussed the mobilization of resources, the motivation of private business in this work, and financing. The priority is obvious. I am grateful to everyone working on this kind of construction, in the production of materials. We also discussed the needs that we will address with our partners to reinforce our defense lines. Special attention is paid to the construction of shelters in schools, in particular here in Zaporizhzhia and the region, so that children can study at least in a mixed format – offline as well. I was in Kharkiv today. A good, emotional meeting in a metro school – an extremely useful, appropriate project. Children study in classrooms like in a regular school, but in the subway – in the shelter that is the subway. I talked to the boys and girls – bright eyes, bright minds, and a very bright school. There is a future when there are children like this. I am sure of it. I had the honor of awarding teachers from Kharkiv and Kharkiv region, from different cities, who work in Ukraine, for the sake of Ukraine. This morning I was in Kupyansk – it is important to support our city and our defenders. I held a meeting with General Syrskyi and the commanders who are fighting in the Kupyansk sector. I awarded the five officers who were present and asked to present awards to soldiers, sergeants, and junior officers separately. Thank you, warriors, for your resilience and for your daily hard work! Today I had three phone calls. German Chancellor Scholz, British Prime Minister Sunak, and Bulgarian Prime Minister Denkov. I have a lot to thank our partners for: our agreements – Ukraine and Germany, Ukraine and the UK, Ukraine and Bulgaria – are all being implemented. We have also outlined new joint steps. Protection of our people. Protection of our Europe. Protection of the international legal order. I thank everyone in the world who helps Ukraine! Glory to all our heroes who are now in combat! Glory to the powerful Ukrainian people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Listened to reports on ammunition and weapons supply; preparing requests for talks with partners – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-12-01</span></div>
  <p>Wishing you good health, dear Ukrainians! Summary for today. Just chaired a Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff meeting. Frontline commanders and the Commander-in-Chief reported on the situation at the front – all main directions. East – Kupyansk, Lyman, Maryinka, Avdiivka. Zaporizhzhia. South and, in particular, our actions in Kherson region. Grateful to all the soldiers on the front lines – in battles, at combat posts. Thanks to everyone helping defend our positions – building fortifications, mining the paths that occupiers try to use. Listened to reports on the supply of ammunition and weapons, we are preparing updated requests for communication with partners. A productive week of talks is ahead. The head of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine presented a report on possible Russian actions and the international situation for the next year at the Staff meeting. We are analyzing all possible scenarios, and there must be our Ukrainian scenario for 2024. Specific operations with entirely specific justifications that will give Ukraine entirely specific results. Everything necessary for our state, our brigades, these specific results must be calculated precisely. This includes issues of mobilization. Everyone in Ukraine understands that changes are needed in this area. It&#x27;s not just about the number of those who can be mobilized. It&#x27;s about terms – for everyone currently in the military – for demobilization – and for those who will join the military. And it&#x27;s about conditions. These are comprehensive things that military leadership and the Ministry of Defense have to work out and present to the Staff for approval. Today, there were some proposals. I am waiting for integrated solutions. Held several important meetings. Minister of Defense and his first deputy. Special, sensitive, non-public issues regarding the provision of our forces. And, a preparatory meeting before the next week. Ukraine&#x27;s participation in meaningful events, including international ones, is planned. Today, we achieved a significant diplomatic outcome – Russia will no longer be part of the leadership of the International Maritime Organization. This is one of the largest and highly influential global institutions responsible for maritime safety. Obviously, the state-terrorist that turned the Black Sea into a battlefield cannot be among those influencing the activities of the International Maritime Organization. The entire week, we worked towards this decision – and it is a success. I am grateful to everyone who contributed to this. Another thing. Greeted the employees of the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Ukraine on their professional day. It is crucial that Ukraine works with all partners in the most knowledgeable, careful, and professional manner to properly document and substantiate Russian crimes against our people, war crimes against our state, with evidence to restore justice. I am grateful to everyone performing this work: prosecutors, detectives, investigators, experts, and criminalists. Also, to everyone worldwide supporting the efforts of our state. The team of the International Criminal Court is busy working with Ukrainian specialists. The investigations into the abduction of children by Russians in the occupied territories of our state, deportations. When Russian officials and criminals receive lawful and just sentences, especially for deporting our children, this will be the defense of humanity on which normal life in the world depends. The Prosecutor General, the system of prosecutor&#x27;s offices in Ukraine, and law enforcement agencies are approaching the necessary just result. I thanked them for this today. Glory to all who fight and work for the interests of Ukraine and Ukrainians! Glory to our strongest nation. A nation that is strongest when it believes in itself and knows its goals. We will definitely achieve our goal. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is important that every week one can say, &quot;I have contributed something of my own to the common defense&quot; – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-12-02</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you good health! First of all, I want to thank each and every one of our soldiers for this week, everyone who is in battle, on combat posts, who performs combat tasks. To all those who help, train, and treat, those who provide the Ukrainian force with everything necessary. Also, of course, to our rescuers – the entire team of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. To the employees of the National Police and the National Guard who have consistently helped our people after Russian shelling and weather-related incidents. To everyone working in our Ukrainian defense industries. To everyone whose work is to assist Ukraine, take care of the interests of our state. To everyone defending Ukraine on the international stage. I thank you all for making this week bring results for our country, for achieving our goals. It is significant that Russia has recently lost its influence in two international institutions. These are the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the International Maritime Organization – one of the key organizations globally responsible for security. Indeed, there is no place for terrorists there, and there will no longer be Russian representatives in the executive bodies. This is entirely fair. I want to specifically acknowledge Germany – German assistance to our defense, to our actions. I am especially grateful for the precise implementation of agreements regarding air defense for Ukraine – strengthening our air shield. This is a lifesaver for thousands of Ukrainian lives – a truly strong outcome of our bilateral cooperation with Chancellor Scholz, with everyone in Germany who supports the protection of life and the rule of international law. There is also another defense package, including much-needed artillery rounds, 155mm. Thank you, Olaf! It is also important that this week sanctions were imposed by the United States against Russian entities supporting the economy of aggression. This includes those who help violate the price cap for Russian oil and those working in Iranian structures for destabilization. This is extremely useful for advancing a just peace – for each week to bring sanction-related updates, adding effectiveness to sanctions. And, of course, our personal gratitude goes to those who have shown exceptional bravery in the battles for Ukraine, for independence. Soldier Taras Davydiuk, a reconnaissance officer in the 130th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion. Thank you, Taras, for your courage and true leadership in combat! Soldier Oleksandr Koturbas, from our renowned 55th Separate Artillery Brigade. Thank you for your resilience, precision, and the destruction of occupiers! Soldier Andriy Hryhoriev and Senior Soldier Vitaliy Krasovsky, both from the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade. They have repeatedly repelled enemy assaults, conducted evacuation of the wounded from the battlefield, and eliminated enemy infantry. These guys are fighting in Bradley vehicles. Thank you for your strength! Sergeant Mykola Shuhailo, from the 704th Radiological, Chemical, Biological Defense Regiment. Thank you for your bravery during storm repulsions, thank you for your will to fight! And two more soldiers from the 93rd Kholodnyi Yar Separate Mechanized Brigade: Soldier Andriy Yatskovets and Junior Sergeant Oleksandr Hakov. Thank you, guys, for your determination in our Ukrainian assault actions! Glory to all who contributes results to Ukraine, everyone who has found their place in the nationwide cause, everyone who helps and cares for Ukraine! Gratitude to all. Respect to all. It is important that everyone remains committed to the common cause. It is important that every week one can say, &quot;I have contributed something of my own to the common defense.&quot; It is important that the actions, the concrete actions of millions of Ukrainians every day, every week, further strengthen the Ukrainian force. Together, we can overcome everything. And please, do not forget to pay attention to air raid alerts, especially these days. Do not neglect it. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everyone should remember that the battle for the fate of Ukraine continues – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-12-03</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today, the Russian occupiers struck at Kherson once again. Brutal strikes. Straight at the city... Houses. Streets. Our hospitals. As of now, two people have been reported dead. My condolences to the families and friends. All the wounded have been provided with the necessary assistance. Altogether, on this day alone, and only in Kherson region, there were more than 20 Russian shelling occasions - similar to those in Kherson, purely terrorist in nature. In the city of Beryslav and in the villages of the region. I extend my gratitude to all the rescuers from the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, to all the National Police personnel working to eliminate the consequences of the shelling. I am grateful to all the doctors and nurses who are providing assistance. I am grateful to the local authorities and volunteers who do not abandon their cities and communities to their fate. Intense battles are ongoing in dozens of areas along the entire frontline. The most severe are the Maryinka, Avdiivka and Bakhmut areas. However, it is also difficult in the south and in Kharkiv region. And every city in Ukraine, where today was a relatively quiet day... Everyone who is now in the rear. Everyone who can afford to spend time at home. Everyone should remember that the battle for the fate of Ukraine continues. It&#x27;s not on social media, not in arguments over political matters, not in squabbling. This battle is where Ukrainians need support every day. Specific things that strengthen Ukraine. Things that add strength to our positions, to our state. Things that allow us to respond to the enemy&#x27;s attacks with our actions. Active actions. Bold actions. I thank everyone who does not forget that the frontline requires support every day. I thank everyone who is working for the sake of unwavering, constant, real support. I thank everyone who understands how important it is for our people in the frontline areas and the temporarily occupied territories to feel that Ukraine remembers them. That Ukraine remembers and will not abandon them to the enemy&#x27;s destruction. I thank everyone who does not get discouraged and does not waste their precious energy on arguments. Those who work for the national interests. Those who heal and save lives. Those who educate children and genuinely care for their communities&#x27; interests. Those who manufacture weapons and ammunition for our warriors. Those who organize volunteer fundraisers and, against all odds, provide assistance to specific units. I am grateful to everyone who trains our soldiers, both here in Ukraine and in partner countries. Each such training mission is a tangible contribution to the victory that will come. Inevitably. If you do not just believe in it, do not just expect victory from the warriors, but do everything in your power every day so that Ukraine becomes stronger and our collective capabilities increase. We are already preparing for the next week, and we will definitely expand the capabilities of our state. In particular, our defense industry. We are preparing new military support packages from our partners. Strengthening our air defense, which is a constant priority, is also in progress. We will definitely retaliate for the occupiers&#x27; terror against our people. We always do. Glory to Ukraine!</p>
