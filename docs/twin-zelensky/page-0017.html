  <h2>There will be no ruins in Ukraine - this is our goal - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-12</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I just took part in a meeting of a special format of support for Ukraine - financial. This event takes place in Washington and brings together the finance ministers of strong democracies - our partners, the European Commission, heads of international financial institutions: the IMF, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The theme is primarily recovery. Recovery of our country after hostilities. I thanked the partners for helping us maintain the stability of Ukraine, our financial stability. And I urged them to be more active so that Ukraine could be more active in reconstruction, in returning normal life to Ukrainians. There will be no ruins in Ukraine. This is our goal. And this will be quite concrete proof of the complete defeat of the terrorist state. Especially since the world knows the solution - regarding the assets of Russia, Russian officials, oligarchs who got rich while their state was becoming a terrorist... All these assets should be used to compensate for the losses of those to whom Russia brought pain and suffering. Russian assets must go to recovery after aggression. The war should be the most costly for the aggressor exactly. And we do everything for this. I am grateful to the partners who support us. I met today in Kyiv with the delegation of the U.S. Senate - a bipartisan delegation. I informed them about what is happening now on the battlefield and about our capabilities. As always, we demonstrated that our relations with America in the supply of weapons, in financial support are completely clean, completely transparent. The partners have a complete vision for every cent and every weapon. And it is important that no artificial manipulations spoil our trust. Of course, I was pleased to hear from our guests from the United States very positive words about Ukraine and what we manage to achieve together in the defense against terror. It was very emotional and honorable for me today to congratulate our young police officers and rescuers of the State Emergency Service on the completion of their education. More than 3 thousand young people - professional and patriotic - are now joining those who are already defending the safety and normality of life. They will work, in particular, in those regions where it is most dangerous. According to the distribution, they will serve in the frontline regions, in the border regions - in Kharkiv and Sumy regions. There are also those who will fight in our new assault brigades. I thank everyone who has chosen this path of direct help to people right now. Without the conscientious work of the State Emergency Service and the police, it is simply impossible to imagine a normal life, it is impossible to save many people. This, in fact, is what constitutes the essence of their work - direct help to people. I believe that today&#x27;s graduates of educational institutions of the MIA system will live up to human expectations. By the way, I would like to celebrate such our defenders - such our rescuers, in particular from Nikopol. Major Artem Shuldyakov, lieutenant Fedor Zayakin, senior sergeant Vasyl Muzychenko, junior sergeant Vitaliy Bulkin, employees of the State Emergency Service. Thank you, guys, for saving Ukrainians after Russian missile attacks! I would also like to mention the police crews - &quot;white angels&quot; who save our people in the Donetsk region, carry out evacuation, deliver humanitarian aid, resuscitate the wounded... I thank policeman Hennadii Yudin from Avdiivka for saving the children, paramedic Vasyl Pipa, one of the &quot;white angels&quot; on the Maryinka frontline. They have already saved hundreds of our people, including seriously wounded ones. I would also like to thank Volodymyr Perepelytsia, an explosives technician of the National Police, who works for demining in the Kherson region, and works very efficiently. Thank you! And one more thing! Today, our country traditionally celebrates the Day of Rocket and Space Industry Workers. The industry that has always ensured glory for Ukraine. And I&#x27;m sure that it will ensure it in the future! I am grateful to everyone who preserved this potential of ours. Our current level of integration into international relations, our level of strength - both state and society - which Ukraine deserves, the level of our people - all this will enable Ukraine to participate in the development of outer space on an equal footing with advanced states, and our business - on an equal footing with advanced companies. But first - we will win! In particular, thanks to Ukrainian missiles. Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat! Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who protects our people and protects Ukrainian life! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In the war, all frontlines need attention and strength, especially the financial frontline - President&#x27;s speech at the third meeting of the ministerial round table on support for Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-12</span></div>
  <p>President Malpass, thank you for your support! Managing director, dear Kristalina, Vice President Dombrovskis. Dear ministers, secretaries and heads of international financial institutions! Thank you all for this meeting, for your work in this format. Ukraine is currently living through a storm of emotions. Yesterday, a video of the brutal murder of our soldier by the occupiers – was shared by Russian sources. They are there, in this video, are proud with their ability to kill. You have probably all seen it on the news. And you know, that Russian army tries to make this level of violence and atrocities a routine everywhere on Ukrainian soil. Every time when they do something like this, one gets shocked like for the first time. And deaths brought by Russia must not become a usual routine! The long story of Russian impunity must finally stop. I thank everyone in the world and all of you who help Ukraine to survive! But every day... Every day we lose our people – men and women, adults and children who die at the hands of Russia. Please – I ask you now to honor with a minute of silence the memory of the Ukrainian soldier whose death the world saw yesterday, and the memory of all our people whose lives were taken away by the Russian invasion. Please. Thank you. Thank you so much. It`s very important for all of us. Dear participants of this meeting! Ukraine will prevail in this war. It is only a matter of time when Russian aggression is defeated. But the evil state should not have any chance to win with ruins. What is always the goal of a terrorist? To break life. If not to kill, then damage. If not to destroy, then to make suffer. Any aggressor who hates life – whether he acts as a state like Russia, or within a terrorist group, or as a single degraded individual... Any aggressor always enjoys when he destroys and when the ruins have to be repaired for decades. Thousands and thousands of facilities in Ukraine have been ruined. Thanks to the partners, most of the expenses for maintaining a normal life have been secured for this year. But the basic needs for reconstruction remain open: it’s housing, energy, transport, social and humanitarian sphere, public services... Recently, I visited the front-line regions and regions of our country bordering Russia. It is so painful to see – cities destroyed by terror, villages burned, and fields dead because they are mined... That’s why supporting fast recovery is a part of counterterrorism work. By rebuilding what has been ruined, we defeat the main goal of terror: we return the normal life. The second point – the assets of the evil state. For the first time in history, the world has such a vast opportunity to charge the aggressor with compensation for damages – the one who is guilty of the unprovoked and illegal war. For example, the World Bank provided a new assessment of the losses and needs of Ukraine – four hundred and eleven billion dollars. Every day, Russia increases this account. The world has Russian assets of various types that cover such a level of losses! The world&#x27;s potential aggressors are now looking: will you do the right thing? It is realistic to confiscate Russia’s assets, as well as assets of persons connected with the ruling elite of the evil state. To confiscate – and direct so that life in Ukraine can be restored. Russia must feel the full price of it’s aggression. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine makes two appeals to you. The first one: priority needs for reconstruction. I thank you for the new program with the IMF, which is an important stabilizing factor for Ukraine. This will help us continue to fight. But in order for people to return to Ukraine, for the aggressor to lose not only on the battlefield, but truly in everything, – we need the approval of the Support Program to cover the priority projects of Fast Recovery. The total volume of such projects is 14.1 billion US dollars. Our government officials who are now in Washington will present the details. And the second one. It’s necessary to work on concrete mechanisms for using frozen Russian assets to compensate for the damage caused by Russia. It must be clearly stated that the assets, including the assets of the Russian Central Bank, will be confiscated. It will be a peacemaking act on a global scale. Potential aggressors must see this and remember that the world can be strong. There may be different formats of solutions, but the faster and more effective the solutions are – the more reliable and long-lasting peace after this war will be. Ladies and Gentlemen! There are no secondary frontlines in this war. All of them require attention and strength. The financial frontline in particular. We are doing our part, and I am grateful to everyone who helps. But the fundamental decisions are up to you. I believe that they will be made! Thank you very much! Glory to all those who are now fighting for life and freedom for our people! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>We are preparing the guys and we are looking forward to the supply of weapons promised by our partners - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-13</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on the day. First. I held a meeting of the Military Cabinet, a special format of work with the leaders of our defense sector, our commanders, intelligence, and the Office. Only what is directly necessary for frontline management and provision of active actions of Ukraine, protection of our state from Russian terror. It was meaningful. And our actions will be powerful. We are preparing the guys. And we are very much looking forward to the delivery of weapons promised by our partners. We are bringing the victory as close as possible. And we’re ensuring the spirit of unity to the maximum. Efficiency - to the maximum. Preparation - also to the maximum. Second. Defense industrial complex. Today, in the Mariyinsky Palace, where we always honor those who have done the most for the Ukrainian state, the day of employees of our defense industry was celebrated for the first time. It is quite unfair that until now there was no such special day in Ukraine when it would be possible to honor the work of all those who create Ukrainian weapons, Ukrainian shells, and Ukrainian equipment. Who also create our missiles, which showed themselves so vividly in the waters of the Black Sea on this day a year ago, April 13, when the sea route of the Russian Black Sea flagship stopped. These are the people who create our guns - 155 millimeters, which are currently on the battlefield and about which we hear only positive feedback from our soldiers and... it is clear what the &quot;feedback&quot; of the occupier is. Of course, it is still impossible to tell most of the positive things that have been achieved regarding our weapons and our own Ukrainian shells not only during the full-scale war, but also in the years before it. But our entire state, the entire society, has much to be grateful for to those professionals who protect and develop our defense-industrial complex. Who are capable of producing everything for Ukraine - from shells to missiles, from artillery to drones. The day before, I signed a decree on the establishment of the Day of Defense Industrial Complex Employee in Ukraine. Exactly on this day of &quot;Neptune&quot; when our missiles hit &quot;Moskva&quot;. But we are also grateful for the rockets and dozens of other types of weapons, equipment and shells supplied for the defense. I had the honor of awarding representatives of the industry. And I am sure that the Ukrainian defense industry will always develop exactly as it has been developing for several years - in constant growth, in the constant expansion of the range of products and opportunities of the industry. The third thing that is important for today. European integration. I held a meeting with government officials and representatives of the Verkhovna Rada regarding some of our steps on rapprochement with the European Union, legislative steps, implementation of the adopted changes. The goal of our state is absolutely achievable. Ukraine will be integrated with all institutions and practices of the European Union, and will acquire full membership. We are fully prepared. And one more thing. I signed decrees on awarding our warriors. Four decrees. 349 servicemen were awarded state awards. Among them are 45 warriors of the Air Forces, 152 warriors of the airborne assault troops, and 152 warriors of the Ground Forces. Today I want to especially celebrate our warriors who are fighting in the Donetsk region as part of General Tarnavskyi&#x27;s &quot;Tavria&quot; operational and strategic group of troops. In particular, marines of the 35th separate brigade and artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade. As always, you are productive, guys! Thank you! Thank you to the fighters of General Moskalyov&#x27;s &quot;Odesa&quot; operational and strategic group of troops - the 63rd separate mechanized brigade, which powerfully beats the occupiers for hitting our cities and villages in the southern direction. And I will also note today the warriors of the 126th separate brigade of the territorial defense forces - aerial reconnaissance. Thank you, guys, for the attentiveness that becomes the accuracy of our artillery. The enemy will certainly suffer losses in response to every strike against the Ukrainians. Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine! I thank everyone who works for our defense and victory! Thanks to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every meter of Ukrainian land must mean the inevitability of Russia&#x27;s defeat in this war for the occupier – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-14</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I spoke today with Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister of the UK. First of all, I am grateful to him and to all world leaders who condemned the brutal murder of our soldier, the murder that the occupiers boasted about. The occupiers will feel what it means when the world condemns them. With Prime Minister Sunak we discussed the weapons for our soldiers – what we agreed with Britain, what will help our active steps, completely just steps. We discussed the acceleration of delivery... The more far-reaching Ukrainian actions are, the sooner Russian atrocities will end. Of course, we continue working on the aircraft coalition for Ukraine, and preparation for various international events that will give all of us in Europe more strength and protection. Today, I held a meeting on Euro-Atlantic integration, on the inevitability of combining the potentials of Ukraine and NATO. The meaningful meeting: the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, government officials – the relevant Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the foreign affairs team of the Office, and the head of the Office. It is obvious that Ukraine&#x27;s place is in NATO, a legal place. And we do not want the outdated illusions, which until now held back our joining the Alliance, continued taking time away from Ukraine and its partners. We are developing the appropriate steps. Today, I held a meeting on the recovery of our country – recovery after hostilities. First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, Deputy Prime Minister Kubrakov, and the recovery team... We discussed things related to infrastructure, the economy, and many other issues that need answers, very valuable answers. We work both within the country and with partners for the sake of systemic reconstruction, for the result to meet the expectations of our society – rather high expectations. I am sure we will do everything. During the day, I was in contact with the military, held a meeting with Ukraine&#x27;s Security Service Chief Maliuk, and a meeting with Defense Intelligence Chief Budanov. The key is the constant destruction of the occupiers, this is the damage to their logistics and any potential in the occupied territories, this is the preparation of our active steps, this is counter-assault work. And I thank all our soldiers who ensure this, who remember that for every Russian attack on our cities and villages, on our positions, for every killing of Ukrainians, the occupier must suffer the most tangible losses. Every meter of Ukrainian land must mean the inevitability of Russia&#x27;s loss in this war for the occupier, the inevitability of the fact that there will be no prospects for the enemy on the land of Ukraine. The 14th Brigade and the 1st Presidential Brigade of the National Guard – thank you guys for your resilience! The 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa, the 5th Separate Assault Brigade, the 77th Separate Airmobile Brigade – well done, soldiers! It is the most difficult thing to hold the line in Donetsk region now. But it gives life to all of Ukraine. Rescue operations are currently underway in Sloviansk, Donetsk region. Another strike by terrorists. S-300 missiles on residential areas, on ordinary civilian buildings. People are under the rubble. Everything is done to save them, everything is done to save the wounded. There are the first data on the dead. My condolences to those who have lost loved ones. Not a single hour of this week before Easter passed without Russian murders and terror. This is an evil state, and it will lose. To win is our duty to humanity as such. And we will win! And one more. Something about which a decision has been needed for a long time. Mikheil Saakashvili&#x27;s life now depends not on a political, not on some personal, but purely on an ethical decision... Which has a clean and solid legal basis. If a person needs medical help, if life depends on it, then this step is necessary. I know that Mikheil&#x27;s lawyers have now submitted an urgent appeal to the ECtHR to provide him with proper treatment. And it seems that this is the only way to save his life. Thank you to everyone who resists evil together with Ukraine! Glory to all our soldiers who are now fighting for the state and people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will restore justice as a memory of all those whose lives were taken by Russia – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-15</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I spoke today with French President Macron. The conversation lasted for almost an hour and a half. We had time to go through all the key security issues on the agenda – very important for us, in Ukraine, and in Europe in general. It is the front, our opportunities to move, to act, to return freedom and justice to the people in those territories, which, unfortunately, are still occupied by Russia. We also discussed international contacts – both ours and France&#x27;s. Emmanuel informed me about the details and results of his visit to China. And I am thankful for the clear support of those principles that unite our entire anti-war coalition. Russia must withdraw from the territory of Ukraine. All Ukraine and all occupiers. And every point of the UN Charter must work again – none of Russia&#x27;s violations of international law can be ignored. It is on such principles that security and peace will return to international relations. It is precisely why there is a Ukrainian Peace Formula, which is absolutely realistic and quite concrete, and it was also discussed in detail with Macron today, as well as the international events we are preparing for this year, in particular, the Vilnius NATO summit. Our joint position at the summit in Lithuania – of all participating states – can be just as ambitious as European security needs. I am sure of that. Effective security guarantees for Ukraine, and, in fact, for the rules-based international order, are needed even before we join the Alliance. By the way, a meeting of the member states of the joint investigation team to investigate the crimes of the occupiers in Ukraine took place in Vilnius. One of the results of the meeting is an agreement – it was signed yesterday. The agreement on joint investigation of not only Russian war crimes but also crimes of genocide. We will ensure Russia&#x27;s full accountability for what it has committed against Ukraine and Ukrainians at all levels, including at the legal level. And I thank all the partners who help bring the verdicts closer to the occupiers – Russian murderers and terrorists. A rescue operation is still ongoing in Sloviansk, Donbas, following yesterday&#x27;s Russian missile strike. It is reported that under the rubble of buildings, there are still bodies of the dead, unfortunately... This terrorist strike alone damaged and destroyed over 50 residential buildings, of which more than 30 are multi-apartment buildings. More than 20 people were injured, and as of this time, 11 have died. Among them is a very small child – a boy born in 2021. My condolences to the relatives, to all those who lost loved ones... None of those who are guilty of this aggression can be forgiven and forgotten. Today, two more decrees with sanctions against individuals and companies that share the blame for this terror or help it were issued. In particular, these are sanctions against persons who promote the terrorist state under the disguise of sports. Against those related to its officials. A separate list includes IT companies that sponsor terror or provide digital opportunities to continue aggression. We synchronize all Ukrainian sanctions with global sanctions, it is an inevitable process. Thank you to everyone in international institutions and partner states who work with us, with government officials, the National Security and Defense Council, intelligence services, and our Office. Sanction pressure on all those who are guilty of this aggression, blocking their assets and opportunities at the level of the whole world is the self-defense of the world and today against any other possibilities of aggression. The return of peace and its stability have no alternatives. Thank you to everyone who helps us, Ukraine! Glory to all our soldiers who are fighting against terrorists! We will restore justice as a worthy memory of all those whose lives were taken by Russia and its terror... Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Easter greetings from the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-16</span></div>
  <p>Dear great people of the great country! At the end of last winter, Russia brought a full-scale war to our land. And with it – death, pain, and darkness. On the morning of February 24, the sun never rose. Dawn never came. On the morning of February 24, a dark night began. And at the same time, our awakening began. Our struggle. Darkness could not overshadow our spirit, desire for freedom, love for our native land, and readiness to defend it. We have kept the light within us. We have conquered panic, fear, feud, and quarrels. We have united. Millions of sparks in millions of Ukrainian hearts became one big bonfire. Our strength and invincibility were tempered in this fire, this fire did not let our hope and faith go out, the whole world saw this fire. It has united around it, stood next to us. Then we defeated despair, hopelessness, fatigue, pain. Millions of lights in the eyes of millions of Ukrainians merged into one powerful beam of light. It helped us not to get lost in the dark, not to get lost on the road, illuminated the path to the right goal. This is what different generations have fought for in different centuries. What our warriors of light – the defenders of Ukraine – gave their lives for in the last nine years and 417 days. What we are fighting for against the dark forces today. This is our dawn. Our revival. This is the dawn of independent Ukraine. Today, we celebrate the holiday of the Resurrection of the Lord. Its main symbol is victory: the victory of good, victory of truth, victory of life. We celebrate Easter with unshakable faith in the irreversibility of these victories. On this day a year ago, we all prayed that Ukraine would endure. Today – for Ukraine to win. We don&#x27;t just wait and ask, we win and create this victory ourselves. 417 days. We have already come a long way. Perhaps the most difficult of the peaks is ahead of us. We will overcome it. And together we will meet our dawn. When the sun will rise all over our country. This is a blue and yellow flag. It will certainly be raised in all our God-given land. In all territories temporarily occupied by devils. Our flag will fly on the shores of the Sea of Azov and the banks of Siversky Donets River, over terricones and Ai-Petri peak. The sun will shine in the south, the sun will shine in the east, and the sun will shine in Crimea. The yellow-hot sun in a peaceful blue sky, and it is the light of justice. It is the light of the reunion of people and families. Ukrainians. All who are now at the front and all who help them in the rear. The glow of the smiles of the winners and their families. The brilliance of the battle orders of the heroes who will return. The sparkle of happy eyes of parents, children, loved ones, friends and relatives who are waiting. This is the light of rebirth. Reconstruction of what was destroyed and mutilated by the occupier. Reconstruction of our beautiful country, which will become even more beautiful in the future. It is the light of verity and truth. The rule of law and justice. Prosecution and punishment of all those who gave and executed criminal orders. All those who killed, tortured, robbed will answer both in the international tribunal and to the Lord. Heaven sees our faith and steadfastness. The world sees our courage and invincibility. The enemy sees our strength and determination. And therefore, Ukraine will see the light of victory. Belief in it unites us all. Always, but especially today. On Easter, which has always been a family holiday for Ukrainians, a day of warmth, hope and great unity. The war could not erase us, our values, our traditions, our holidays, and the most important things they symbolize. And therefore, no matter where we celebrate Easter, no matter where each of us is now, we celebrate Easter together. We are one big family. Ukrainians. We have one big home. Ukraine. We have one big goal. Victory. For all. Those who are no longer with us, who gave their lives for Ukraine. We remember everyone and ask God to appease their souls. We believe in everyone who continues to defend the Motherland, and we ask God to protect and preserve them. With all our strength, we fight for our land and ask for the help of heavenly forces. In hundreds of prayers that our ancestors said before the battle, which help our soldiers and protect them today. I will put on the shroud of Jesus Christ, my skin is iron shell, my blood is strong ore, my bone is a damask sword. I am faster than an arrow, more alert than a falcon. The armor is on me. The Lord is in me. For tomorrow. For a peaceful dawn. For the victory. For Ukraine. Christ is Risen! He is Risen Indeed!</p>

  <h2>We are preparing for the next Ramstein meeting, we expect solidly grounded decisions to meet the prospects on the battlefield – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! This day began with a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. Many topics. The front line is the actions of our defense forces, what is achieved, and what we need to achieve. The commanders of the Khortytsia, Tavria, Odesa, Pivnich task forces, Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny – all reported on the current situation. Supply of ammunition for our soldiers – separately at the Staff meeting. Today, more details about this: not only supply, but also everything related to manufacturing – both by the state and private companies. Minister of Strategic Industries Kamyshin, Minister of Defense Reznikov, and Commander of the Logistics Forces Huliak also reported. I held a meeting with Prime Minister Shmyhal on the results of his trip to Canada and the United States, these were meetings primarily for financial support of Ukraine by partners. The results are substantive. This applies to relations with the IMF and other international institutions and bilateral relations with Canada and the United States. Thanks to all our partners who always help! By the way, we are already preparing for another Ramstein meeting. I held preparatory meetings. And we expect solidly grounded decisions that will meet the prospects on the battlefield. Quite ambitious prospects, which we are approaching with all our might. Moreover, we are approaching them not only for ourselves, not only for Ukraine but also for our entire anti-war coalition. The aggressor must lose. And this is our joint responsibility with our partners – to gain more time for peace, that is, to be as active as possible now in providing weapons and ammunition to speed up our joint victory. I signed the decree on awarding state awards to our soldiers. 127 soldiers of the Armed Forces... 68 of them – posthumously. It is very important to understand this: every time we hear that the promised supply of weapons is delayed, every time there are doubts about the type of weapons for Ukraine, about the range or other quality characteristics – every time it means that Ukrainian soldiers are giving their lives so that we have this time... The time that is spent to convince so that the supply of the necessary weapons takes place after all. Today, I&#x27;d like to especially commend our soldiers from the 5th Separate Assault Brigade and the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade for active and successful assault operations in Bakhmut. Thanks to the 214th Rifle Battalion for powerful blows against the enemy near Bakhmut! 92nd separate mechanized brigade – thank you for the result in Luhansk region! Donetsk direction... Fighters of the 35th and 36th Separate Marine Infantry Brigades, 55th Separate Artillery Brigade. Paratroopers of the 79th Air Assault Brigade. Soldiers of the 74th Separate Intelligence Unit, the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade named after Yakov Handziuk... Thank you all! In Zaporozhzhia, there is something to praise for the soldiers of the 128th separate assault brigade of Zakarpattia. Well done! Every destroyed enemy now is a liberated meter of Ukrainian land tomorrow. And one more. Yesterday, a search and rescue operation ended in Sloviansk after Russian terrorists attacked residential buildings. I want to mention our people who, together with their colleagues on the ground, did everything possible... Despite the threat of repeated strikes, and despite all the difficulties, they did everything possible to save as many lives as possible. I thank Sergeant Yaroslav Pletsky, Senior Sergeant Viktor Herhel, Senior Lieutenant Bohdan Havrylov, and Lieutenant Colonel Mykhailo Zahnitko, all who participated in this operation. Thank you to everyone in the great team of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine who works for the people! Glory to our soldiers! Eternal memory to all those, whose lives were taken by Russian terror! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is inspiring and encouraging to see our Ukrainian resolve and know that there will be victory - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-18</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We are wrapping up this day in Poltava. Quite a long and emotional day. In the morning I was in the Donetsk region, in our Avdiivka. It is hard to see what Russian terrorists have done to this city… And honor to each of our warriors, to all Ukrainian men and women, who have been restraining and gradually destroying this Russian evil for 419 days and 9 years already. I had the honor to congratulate Ukrainian soldiers and officers on Easter, to present awards. I often thank them in my evening addresses for their accuracy and bravery, for destroying the occupiers. The 55th separate artillery brigade, marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, paratroopers of the 79th separate brigade, warriors of the 110th separate mechanized brigade... The 501st separate marine battalion... Bohdan Khmelnytsky separate presidential brigade... Thank you all for your service! And thank you all for the chevrons you gave me today, it&#x27;s truly an honor. Thanks guys! I especially want to thank our medical forces, all the doctors and nurses who bring our defenders back to life after wounds. I visited hospitals both in the Donetsk region and here in Poltava. I am proud of our people, strong even when they are still recovering. Honor and respect to all who heal our soldiers! I held a long, meaningful meeting in Poltava regarding the situation in the region. The military leadership, local authorities... The first priority is security and social issues, security for educational institutions, reconstruction, support for displaced persons. There are solutions for the restoration of the energy sector - generation and networks. There are various assignments of the working level - what we should support the Poltava region with. And we will definitely do it. It is important that we do not lose a single day in communication with our partners. And it was from here, from Poltava, that I had a conversation with Speaker of the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress Kevin McCarthy. I thanked for the unflagging bipartisan support. Right after a trip to the frontline, I briefed Mr. McCarthy on what is happening now at the front, on our defense needs and capabilities. I raised the issue of F-16, long-range weapons, additional artillery and the tribunal - the tribunal regarding Russia&#x27;s aggression against our country. Together, we make the free world stronger, and every dollar invested in that strength is fully transparent and accountable to our partners. I invited Mr. Speaker to visit Ukraine. It is truly inspiring and encouraging to see our Ukrainian resolve and know that there will be victory. I am thankful to the Donetsk and Poltava regions for today! Thank you to everyone who works for our victory! Glory to everyone who is currently in combat, at combat posts, on combat missions! And today I would like to mention separately those of our fighters who identify and destroy enemy positions, those positions from which the occupier fires at our cities and villages. Russian strikes at Kherson, at the Beryslav district, at the cities of the Donetsk region - all the enemy strikes will face our response. A tangible response. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>At the state level, everything is being done to increase the ability to defend against Russian strikes - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-19</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I am on my way back from a working trip. Today I was in Volyn, visited our border guards, on the border, in particular, with Belarus. Arrangement of the border, defense, development of the border area - many issues. Volyn shows true strength, and this is felt in the way the region strengthens the security of the entire state. I awarded our border guards... Together with all our defense and security forces, border guards are fighting on the frontline, particularly in the most difficult areas. Bakhmut, Donetsk region in general... True heroes who successfully completed hundreds and hundreds of combat missions. We are also preparing new units - units of border guards in particular - that will join our active actions, the movement that we are gradually building up. We constantly work on the development of our regions - absolutely all of them. Today in Volyn, I held a broad meeting with the region’s leaders, local law enforcers, military personnel, and all those responsible for the security and social condition of the region. We agreed on several infrastructure projects that will strengthen Volyn - this is important - and will make it possible to guarantee long-term jobs and economic growth. I am sure that we will definitely implement all this. Very soon. We continue to prepare our international steps not only for this week, but in general for the near future. The defense of Ukraine, the rules-based international order remain the number one issue on the global agenda. By the way, I am grateful to the United States for another package of military support announced today. And today I would like to note separately our defenders of the sky - the Air Forces and the corresponding units of other branches of the troops. At the state level, everything is being done to increase the ability to defend against Russian strikes. Air defense systems and other weapons to protect the sky are already here in Ukraine, they are really powerful. But they should be - and, I am sure, will be - even more powerful. I am thankful to everyone who, with their accuracy and speed, ensures the effectiveness of all the weapons that our state has received! Soldiers of the 160th Odesa anti-aircraft missile brigade of the “South” air command and mobile fire groups of the 164th Slobidska radio engineering brigade of the “East” air command were particularly effective this night. Thank you! During the day, our soldiers protected the skies of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Kyiv, the region, other cities, other regions of ours... Glory to each and every one who is now fighting for our country, for the sake of Ukraine! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are opening a new level of interaction between communities of Ukraine and communities of partner states - speech by Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the International Summit of Cities and Regions in Kyiv</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-20</span></div>
  <p>Glory to Ukraine! I am glad to welcome here our entire state, all of Ukraine - all our beautiful cities and villages, our strong communities - which are represented in the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Ukraine. With this Summit, we are opening a new level of interaction on the Congress site - this is interaction between our communities - the communities of Ukraine and the communities of other respectable states - the states of our partners, which we highly appreciate. Those who, like all Ukrainians, value the most important thing - value freedom and important, effective local self-government. Mr. Jens! I am very glad to welcome you once again, dear representatives of the institutions of the European Union, the Council of Europe, states, governments and parliaments of our partners! Dear mayors of cities, heads of municipalities and associations! I thank you for participating in this format of our work. But I ask you to record one important fact - a fact that was confirmed by our defense against Russian aggression. The entire Ukrainian people stood up for the defense of their state, and this is a manifestation of the experience of our people. A nation that knows how to act together for the sake of the national good, a nation that knows how to protect its interests, a nation whose national security begins with the understanding that every community must live with dignity, live with self-regard... Such a nation has an advantage in war, namely: it can wage a nationwide fight. And I thank each of our people and each of our Ukrainian communities, who, in unity with the state and in interaction with each other, help bring the most important thing closer - our joint victory! Thank you to all of you, dear attendees - who are both offline and online! Ladies and Gentlemen! You see that the Russian state throws people to the front who do not understand what they are dying on our land for. This land is foreign to them. The occupiers bring evil, because the Russian system exists just like that: it tries to make the abuse of people and the devaluation of life commonplace. And it tries to take it beyond its borders. This is precisely why Russia needs its weapons - its missiles, bombs, its artillery and its disgraceful terror against everything that ensures a normal life. The Ukrainian system, like any normal European system, is completely opposite to the Russian model. Our strength lies in our people. In our communities, in our ability to act for a common goal in a decentralized manner in particular – when needed; and when we need unity and state action precisely, this is achieved, first of all, by people&#x27;s faith in Ukraine and people&#x27;s trust in their state, its defenders, and each other. I am very grateful to most of our communities and all our people. If we consider this war a confrontation of ideas, together with the victory of our state, we will inevitably celebrate the victory of the idea that people are important. Each and every one. All our communities. Every Ukrainian city, every town, every Ukrainian village. Our entire state. And due to this approach, instead of the ruins that Russia brought and brings to us, we will rebuild a real Ukrainian life everywhere - a European free life. The life, which our people, ordinary yet free, respect. The one where every person is respected. Dear attendees! Dear partners of ours! I would like to address you. I invite all of you to already build direct relations with our Congress of Local and Regional Authorities and, accordingly, with the help of the Congress, with Ukrainian communities in order to start joint actions as soon as possible and jointly build a new system of protection of our common way of life. Open, democratic, free life based on very simple things, on cooperation. Here and now in Ukraine we can see what aggression can bring to any people - if somewhere in another part of the world there is an attempt to repeat it. And we see what safety standards cities need today, our villages need. I am sure that by our example we can see what security standards are needed by any country in the world, any towns, villages, communications, transport, energy, all infrastructure (which has also been tested by this war), schools, education networks, as well as safety in construction in general, in order to guarantee the most important thing under all circumstances - the protection of life. And I invite you to participate in the development of a new security infrastructure in Ukraine - so that later this important work can be spread to other countries and regions. From bomb shelters in schools – to a completely new standard of cyber security for all systems of the country, from a new protected infrastructure in every community – to a new decentralized energy system in general in the country, which cannot be destroyed by the missile terror that the Russian Federation used against our state. Today, I want to thank all the countries separately, as well as thank the respective communities, all cities, and nations. The most important thing is people, so I am very grateful to people. To ordinary people and leaders of societies who have helped and continue to do so. They helped Ukraine go through this most difficult period – the period of brutal, bloody darkness - the period of winter, to resist Russian missile terror, against terrorist attacks on our energy system. I am grateful to everyone who helped us! And I would especially like to note today the help of Paris - which this winter became one of the leaders of energy support for Ukraine, which consolidated partners in such an &quot;energy Ramstein&quot;. I thank you very much. This meeting was in Paris, then our partners supplied the appropriate equipment that helped us, absolutely all people, communities preserve the light of life. Ukraine established a special award for cities rescuers. You know that many cities in Europe and Poland received this award from Ukraine. They really helped. I am grateful to all our partners. And today it will also be an honor for me to hand over such an award precisely for such great energy support to the mayor of Paris, Mrs. Anne Hidalgo, as a sign of gratitude for the support of Parisians for Ukraine and Ukrainians. Thank you very much, France, the President, and thank you also to all Parisians who support. Dear attendees, Ladies and Gentlemen! I am sure that the important new Ukrainian defense infrastructure and our cooperation for the sake of security will become an example for countries, cities, communities, and people. Just as Russian aggression caused global negative, very painful consequences, the Ukrainian victory should bring the world new security standards, new experience of joint action and economic potential, new opportunities to build and defend - together. Together! At the level of states and companies, communities and people. Having carried out decentralization reform in Ukraine even before the war, having given our communities more powers – it is very important, and resources – it is also very important, we established this Congress to ensure respect for every community. To give every community all the tools to implement its interests, the interests of society of this community, the interests of communities. Here, in the Congress, the central power of our country is involved in joint work - both the executive and legislative power. We must work together so that the community does not have to look for solutions in offices in the capital. All our local self-government is here. To make it easier for our communities to interact. Interact faster. Now we add an international component. I am confident that this component can be implemented to the full extent, just as we use our internal strength to the full extent for the sake of protecting Ukraine, our people, for the sake of Ukraine&#x27;s victory. May this alliance of ours add strength and energy to all our other areas of cooperation, including the Alliance represented here today by the honorable and respected Secretary General of the Alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, and of which Ukraine will definitely become a part. We are sure of this and we are doing everything to make it happen as soon as possible! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is important that, as long as the aggression continues, Russia does not have any access to sports, Olympic venues - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-20</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I’ve just addressed the Mexican parliament, and this is already the second such address to the Latin American region. I am grateful to Mexico for the attention to Ukraine and for supporting our view on international security, on the need for the broadest possible unity of the world to protect international law. Because if the law does not work, the threat to life will only grow... Bandits and aggressors will become even more insolent. We have to prevent this. In fact, the talks with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg were devoted to the same thing today in Kyiv. Defense of Ukraine. Protection of the entire rules-based international order. Protection of life. We are preparing for the Ramstein meeting, and Mr. Stoltenberg&#x27;s position is important. We are preparing for our active actions at the front – they are inevitable. We are also preparing for the NATO Summit in Vilnius, which is scheduled for the summer of this year, but its content is already being worked out. Exactly at such meetings, in contacts of various levels that we conduct with partners. Neither the majority of Ukrainians, nor the majority of Europeans, nor the majority of the inhabitants of the entire NATO space will understand the leaders of the Alliance, if a well-deserved political invitation to the Alliance is not sounded for Ukraine at this Summit in Vilnius. Ukraine did everything to ensure that our application was approved. It is difficult to even say whose contribution to European and Euro-Atlantic security is greater than that of our warriors... Ukrainian men and women who defend freedom with their lives. I am grateful to all partners who support us in this. The International Summit of Cities and Regions was held today in Kyiv. A new format of cooperation between our state and partners. The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Ukraine, which unites the central government and local leaders, is now gaining an international level. To more actively involve foreign partners in the reconstruction of our state, in the development of the economy and infrastructure in our communities. I am grateful to everyone who took part in the Summit... Representatives of different countries, cities, municipalities. European institutions, the Council of Europe, the President of the European Committee of the Regions... More than a hundred participants from almost forty countries. I am grateful to everyone for supporting Ukraine! Today I met with the Mayor of Paris, Mrs. Anne Hidalgo. I had the honor to present her with a special award of Ukraine for the capital of France, the award of the rescuer city. Paris has become one of the biggest centers of power for Ukraine in Europe - in every sense. I would like to especially note the help in protecting our energy sector. It was in the capital of France that a conference of the so-called &quot;Energy Ramstein&quot; format was held. Paris has accumulated significant support for Ukraine with energy equipment, provides social and humanitarian support. I thank all French people, all Parisians, French President Macron for constant attention to Ukraine, for leadership. And I especially want to note the absolutely principled position - and so congruent with Ukrainian - of the Mayor of Paris regarding the protection of the Olympic Movement from Russian ideologization and propaganda. It is obvious that a terrorist state will do everything to justify itself through sports or to use the international Olympic Movement to support its aggression. That is why it is important that, as long as the aggression continues, the Russian state does not have any access to sports, Olympic venues. In particular, to the Paris venue – it is this city that will host the 2024 Olympics. Today, the Mayor of Paris once again confirmed that she sees no place for representatives of the aggressor state in Paris as long as the aggression continues. This is a clear and important signal, thank you for it. It would be great if exactly such signals were heard in the International Olympic Committee, where, unfortunately, the personal benefit of individual bureaucrats dominates the Olympic principles. And one more thing. Today, the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims ends... And it ends for the second time during the full-scale aggression of the evil state against Ukraine, against all our people, all communities. The bright holiday of Ramazan-Bayramı deserves completely different conditions. Deserves peace we so long for, deserves victory to which we are all heading. I believe that the Lord will bless Ukraine with freedom for all our territories and all our people. I wish our entire Muslim community and all Muslims of the world a peaceful holiday! Ramazan bayramıñız hayırlı ve mubarek olsun! Glory to all our warriors who are now fighting for Ukraine! Thanks to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Peace must become irreplaceable, that is why evil must lose - speech by the President of Ukraine at the General Congress of the United Mexican States</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-21</span></div>
  <p>Dear attendees! There is a 9-hour time difference between us and more than 10,000 kilometers of distance. We have a different state path. And we speak different languages. But we also have something that allows us to understand each other. It is equally heartbreaking for Ukrainians and Mexicans when we see how innocent lives are taken. Taken by brutal violence where real peace could reign. Peace is the main desire in billions of prayers on earth, and tens of millions of such prayers and such wishes are heard in Ukraine every day. Ladies and Gentlemen! People of Mexico! Aren’t we united by the dream of safety and peace on all the streets of all the cities of our countries? Don’t we equally condemn those who shoot civilians and burn houses? We both equally do not perceive evil. Evil has many manifestations, but always one main target – human life. Whatever the continent and whatever the country. In the same way, protecting life is a feat everywhere in the fight against evil. And everyone who saves from violence, everyone who pulls children out from under the bullets of murderers, everyone who stops torturers and looters, everyone who protects women from rapists... Every defender of life should get the highest respect of their society and all decent people of the world. Because life is of the highest value. Peace is of the highest value. And the greatest meanness is to launch aggression against another nation and wage bandit wars. Can Ukraine stop resisting Russia&#x27;s aggression? No, because then we will lose our life. And it&#x27;s not just about something abstract. Those for whom life is worth nothing came to our land. Russian soldiers fired at hundreds of cars with people who wanted to flee hostilities right on the roads... They created torture chambers in each of our cities that Russia managed to capture. These were usually basements where people were tortured for weeks and months... Russian soldiers took whole villages hostage, all the inhabitants. And when they killed some, and others went to bury them, sometimes those others were also shot... Hitting a railway station with a missile, where hundreds of people are waiting on the platform for an evacuation train, is routine for the Russian army. A little more than a year ago, on April 8, it happened in our city of Kramatorsk... Sixty-one lives were taken by that Russian missile and one hundred and twenty-one people were wounded... And this is just one such terrorist attack! Can you imagine a deliberate attack on the church on the eve of Easter? An artillery strike? For the Russian occupiers in Ukraine, this is not something special. They destroyed 256 churches on our land. And if so many churches alone have been destroyed, imagine the number of houses. Thousands and thousands of high-rise buildings were destroyed by Russian shelling, tens of thousands of private houses. Villages and cities burned to the ground by the occupier - dozens of such villages and cities - this is what Ukraine is experiencing. Mexico protects the peaceful coexistence of peoples and seeks stability for every nation, seeks security. And therefore, I am sure, your people will understand us - and they will understand Ukraine. I’m asking you to try to look at the world through the eyes of a woman, through the eyes of a mother who left her two-year-old child at home with her husband... She went to a neighboring house for a short time. And it was at this time that Russian missiles hit her house, an ordinary apartment building in one of the Ukrainian cities. This woman sees that there is nothing left where her apartment, her husband, her child were. A Russian missile destroyed the entire floor where this family lived. Unfortunately, the child died... How will the mother go on with her life? As well as the relatives of four hundred and seventy children killed since the beginning of the Russian aggression. And this is only what we can officially confirm. We can see on satellite images, we know from intelligence sources what is happening in the territory that is still occupied by Russia: how much the area of cemeteries has increased there, how many spontaneous burials have appeared there... Tens of thousands of graves! Those Ukrainians who were killed when the Russian army was advancing, and those who were killed during the occupation. All these people could be alive... If Russia had not started this war! It is a man-made evil that sows death in the same way as the most violent elements, in the same way as terrible earthquakes. Every day our people hear a siren as a warning about Russian strikes... It is scary when nations are bonded by this knowledge - knowledge about the state of such a threat to life. I want to be completely frank with you now. Unfortunately, the world is still full of hypocrisy. Russia says it allegedly wants peace, although these Russian murderers still remain on our land and take the lives of our people every day... Various large corporations, transnational businesses still want to earn billions from trade with Russia, and therefore, in addition to the propaganda spread by Russia itself, the information space is also filled with artificial doubts about whether it is worth fighting against the evil that this state brings. There are some leaders who were not in Ukraine during this war and did not see what Russian aggression brought here and why it is important to protect life, yet simply for the sake of populism they say something as if Ukraine is not willing to move towards peace... They are trying to involve your leaders in this destructive vision of the situation as well... More than 5 months ago, I presented the Ukrainian Peace Formula. It happened at the G20 Summit in Indonesia. The Formula is an expression of our experience, which we have gained in protecting life, fighting for a diplomatic solution. How does Russia respond to the Peace Formula? Shelling, assaults, murders. But the world and our striving for peace are stronger than any aggressor! The Ukrainian Peace Formula is addressed primarily to the world - and this is its strength. It is addressed to everyone who can participate in the implementation of specific points of the Formula and become a co-creator of the victory over evil - a co-creator of peace. Now, when Russia feels its weakening and the approach of its defeat on the battlefield, Moscow is again trying to deceive the world with its hypocrisy and gain time to regroup, find new weapons, continue aggression. This cannot be allowed. Peace must become irreplaceable. That is why evil must lose. That is why we turn to the world for support. That is why we call on all conscientious states to join global efforts to implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula. And I invite you to choose which clause of the Peace Formula allows Mexico to show leadership! Ukraine has already proposed to the Latin American community to convene a special summit and speak unitedly in defense of the globally important principles of territorial integrity, peace and respect between peoples, and the sovereignty of nations. I believe, with the help of Mexico, it can happen much faster! Ladies and Gentlemen! People of Mexico! Thank you for the fact that your country helps protect the rules-based international order. Your vote in the UN General Assembly and at other international platforms is extremely important - a vote in defense of the principles and goals of the UN Charter, and therefore in defense of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and all the nations of the world. Thank you for your humanitarian support for Ukraine, for the treatment and rehabilitation programs for our people who were injured as a result of Russian aggression, and for your respect for the Ukrainian community in Mexico. Please continue to defend the principles, conventions and treaties that underpin international order and global stability. Bandits and aggressors should be recognized as bandits and aggressors. And anyone who turns life into a target should receive fair sentences... No matter what continent or country it is. That is why, by the way, we are working on the creation of a Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and helping the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for the Russian dictator in the case of mass and systematic abduction of Ukrainian children to Russian territory. Is it too much to seek justice? It is as natural as protecting life. No one in the world has the right to stand higher than human life. No one in the world has the right to destroy peace. No one in the world should be &quot;more equal&quot; than international law. I am sure that Ukraine and Mexico share an absolute solidarity in this. I sincerely wish you peace! I invite you to work together for the safety of our nations and the safety of the world as a whole! Thank you for your attention! La patria es primero! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Now we all need to stay united, mobilized and fully focused on defense – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-21</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. Generals Syrsky, Tarnavsky, the Commander-in-Chief, the Defense Intelligence chief, and representatives of the Government reported. We constantly and carefully analyze the course of hostilities, the hottest and all potentially dangerous areas. The frontline is priority number one. We are also actively preparing new brigades and units that will show themselves at the front. The issue of their provision, training, and integration into the overall Defense Plan – we add crucial details every time at the Staff meetings. Everyone in Ukraine must understand that the main task of the state is the de-occupation of our territories, the return of our lands and our people from Russian captivity. State resources are directed primarily to this task. And I am grateful to everyone who helps. Who keeps the world&#x27;s focus on Ukraine. To everyone who creates jobs in Ukraine, who pays taxes, and who stays in the country and supports the work of their enterprises. To everyone who organizes fundraising for our soldiers and recovery – fundraising in Ukraine, in other countries... Now, just like last year, we need to stay united, mobilized and fully focused on defense. Today, I would like to personally thank each and every one who manufactures weapons and ammunition, drones at state-owned defense enterprises and businesses that joined, all those who repairs equipment, who creates new equipment, in particular, for demining. Thank you for the fact that, despite everything, Ukraine is increasing our defense production potential. Today, at the Staff meeting, we, as usual, considered the missile program and ammunition issues in detail. All day the utmost attention to communication in the Ramstein format, today was a meeting. I thank those partners whose determination is fully in line with the actual situation and needs on the battlefield. I am waiting for the report of the Minister of Defense on the results of the meeting. I spoke with the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, she was visiting Kyiv. The key is the real economic interaction of the EBRD with Ukraine, and the bank&#x27;s involvement in the recovery and development of our country. Every investment now, every job saved or created in Ukraine, every implemented economic project is also protection. And when it comes to defense, speed is crucial. The attention of the EBRD was drawn, in particular, to the urgent needs for recovery, housing construction, and investment opportunities in Ukraine. To work with Ukraine and in Ukraine right now is to implement the very mission for which the EBRD was created. Today, I also held an ad hoc meeting regarding those events – primarily international – that are to be held in the coming weeks and months. We work out the content of each event in detail. Ukraine and our soldiers have no time for formal politics and any impractical things. Every event, every negotiation and meeting should give concrete help to the defense, should concretely strengthen our soldiers and protect our values. Weapons and ammunition for our soldiers, resilience for our economy, real preparedness for any scenarios – all this is absolutely substantive. So it was and so it will be. Of course, I want to thank our soldiers. Bakhmut. For brave actions – to 5th Separate Assault Brigade. Thanks, guys! Lyman direction. For stability and reliable holding of positions – to 66th Separate Mechanized Brigade. Well done! 96th Kyiv Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. Thank you, warriors, for your accuracy! Thank you to everyone who is currently in positions, in the trenches, on combat missions, and on combat duty! Thanks to everyone who helps the front! And please remember those who gave their lives defending Ukraine and Ukrainians. Great tribute to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The task is to remove any opportunity for Russia to circumvent sanctions – address of Ukraine&#x27;s President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Three new decisions on sanctions against those who invest in and support Russian aggression entered into force today. Firstly, this is another package of sanctions against the Russian defense industry enterprises that maintain the terrorist army. This time, 322 companies were added to the sanctions lists – manufacturers of weapons, components, etc. The other two sanctions lists include individuals and legal entities that help circumvent sanctions against Russia, keep the property of war criminals, and are involved in the destruction of freedom both on the territory of Russia itself and on our land. Our sanctions packages are being worked out in detail, in particular, regarding their synchronization with partners. It is one of the key common tasks of all of us – absolutely everyone who seeks a faster end to the war, a faster victory for us. The task is to remove any opportunity for Russia to circumvent sanctions. Every Russian scheme that makes it possible to bypass sanctions makes this war longer, adds opportunities for the aggressor. Accordingly, the tougher the sanctions regime against Russia, the more restrictions against the terrorist state and all related persons, against the entire Russian war economy, the faster the end of the aggression will be. And I thank everyone in the world who understands this. It is important that global restrictive work on the Russian nuclear industry has begun. This industry not only generates funds for the aggressor&#x27;s budget, but also helps to make dependent other states, on the territory of which allegedly &quot;energy&quot; nuclear projects are being implemented. Any energy is a weapon for the Kremlin. For them, nuclear energy is also a weapon. And this, by the way, is exactly what is happening at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Russia uses precisely as a weapon to blackmail the world. To use a disaster as blackmail. And it is good that the UK, the United States, France, Japan, and Canada have created an alliance that should remove the nuclear industry of the terrorist state from the global market. Separately, I would like to thank the United States and Canada for the new defense support packages for our soldiers. Thank you, friends! The Netherlands – thank you for strengthening air defense and for the joint decision with Denmark on tanks. I&#x27;m thankful to Germany. We have new steps that will bring more peace to our skies and… there may be new steps that would bring more peace to our land. We await these decisions. I&#x27;m thankful to Estonia, Finland for the new defense packages. I&#x27;m thankful to Slovakia for the aircraft. I&#x27;m thankful to Switzerland for the new sanctions against Russian terrorists. We are preparing the next week in relations with partners to be no less fruitful than this one. Each such result for Ukraine is the saved lives of our people. It is the ability of our soldiers to protect the lives, repel Russian assaults and prepare active Ukrainian actions. I thank all our soldiers who are now in battle! Especially those who are currently in the toughest places of the frontline – Maryinka and Bakhmut, Avdiyivka, Lyman direction. That&#x27;s where it&#x27;s most intense. Thank you to the soldiers of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the border guards... Separately, today I would like to mention the Defense Intelligence unit of Tymur fighting in Bakhmut. Thank you, guys, for your courage and efficiency! Glory to all our soldiers! Glory to all our heroes of different times who fought for our independence! Ukraine will always be free! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our victory in this war will be shared by everyone who was bringing it closer - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-23</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I want to focus on words of gratitude. First of all, to the warriors. To everyone who is currently in battle, in positions, on combat missions. Avdiivka, Maryinka, Bakhmut, Lyman direction, Siversk... The 35th separate marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Ostrohradsky, the 55th separate artillery brigade &quot;Zaporizka Sich&quot;, the paratroopers of our &quot;Seventy-ninth&quot; - thank you, soldiers! Always brave and strong! The 80th brigade of the airborne assault troops - thank you for the exemplary destruction of the enemy near Bakhmut. Well done, guys! The 54th separate mechanized brigade named after Hetman Mazepa - thank you for your resilience, for defending the positions, and therefore for the defense of Ukraine! It is important to understand that in each of our cities, in each village, wherever it is now more or less quiet. Everywhere where today was just a calm spring sunny day... Every day of such calmness in the rear areas is gained by our warriors in brutal battles on the frontline. In daily battles! Please, respect this. And always help our soldiers when needed, always support the state and defense as much as possible. Second – gratitude to the rescuers, all our employees of the State Emergency Service, who are involved in eliminating the consequences of enemy strikes. Thanks to the entire team of the State Emergency Service! And our firefighters-rescuers should be singled out for their work this week - sergeant Roman Svitlychnyi, sergeant Petro Bondarenko, senior sergeant Oleksiy Inhulskyi, commander of the 5th state fire and rescue post, senior ensign Oleksandr Ivanenko, chief of the 13th fire and rescue unit of the city of Nemyriv major Vasyl Melnyk and Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Kuzmenko from the Main Directorate of the State Emergency Service in the Poltava region. Thank you! Third – our psychologists. Today is the professional day of psychologists in our country, and I thank each and every one who chose this particular profession and dedicates their life and their time to the health and peace of mind of others. No matter where you work, no matter when you work, no matter under what conditions it happens, the purpose of a psychologist&#x27;s work is always noble - to help. I am thankful to those who help our people! The fourth point. Since the 90s, the World Book and Copyright Day has been celebrated annually on April 23. Now, when millions of our people are in different countries, when Ukrainian children live and study in other linguistic and cultural environments, it seems to me that it is especially important that, through a Ukrainian book, the Ukrainian vision of the world unites our people, maintains a connection with home. And I thank everyone who helps spread our book around the world. Who implements such projects as, for example, &quot;Books without Borders&quot;. In the difficult past year, more than 280,000 books were distributed in the framework of this project. 20 countries joined. Or our other project - Ukrainian bookshelves in almost 40 countries of the world. Thanks to everyone who helps! Thanks to all our Ukrainian publishers who continue their work. And, of course, I thank everyone who writes in Ukrainian and about Ukraine. And, finally, the fifth. We continue to prepare several important international events that can give our state more strength and provide our soldiers with more weapons. Almost every day relevant communication with partners, relevant tasks for our diplomacy take place. Discussions, conversations, meetings. And I thank everyone involved in such preparatory work. In the absolute majority of cases, this work is invisible to the general public. And rightly so. That&#x27;s how it works. The result is based on preparation. Thanks to everyone who prepares the results for Ukraine! The Office, the government, our diplomatic missions - thank you to everyone involved! Our victory in this war will be shared by everyone who was bringing it closer. All those who fought and worked for victory. Glory to every Ukrainian hero! Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are already preparing our energy sector for the next winter - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-24</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I came back to Kyiv from a working trip to Zhytomyr, we actually worked there all day. First, there was the visit of Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. Negotiations and signing of the Joint Declaration. I am grateful to Mrs. Prime Minister and the entire Estonian people for their clear and unwavering support of our movement to the European Union and NATO – the relevant points on the Alliance are included in the declaration. Today, most attention was paid to defense issues, and this is obvious. Estonia is among those whose assistance to our defense is the fastest and the largest if you look at the ratio of aid to the country&#x27;s GDP. This applies to guns for our artillery, shells and weapons for our anti-aircraft gunners... Many aspects. We also discussed decisions on weapons and ammunition that are still being implemented by our other partners in the European Union. This is the case when people&#x27;s lives directly depend on the speed of delivery and the implementation of decisions already made. I am grateful to Estonia for its willingness to assist in the relevant communication with other partners. Zhytomyr was not chosen as a venue for our talks by chance. It is in the Zhytomyr region that a reconstruction project has been implemented, which gives Estonia the lead - the lead in how quickly what has been agreed upon is implemented. In the city of Ovruch, Zhytomyr region, the reconstruction of a kindergarten is to be completed by June 1 – with the help of Estonia. This project will be further expanded. There are other reconstruction projects as well, and I am sure we will implement them all. It was a great pleasure to visit Zhytomyr Polytechnic and talk to the university students. It&#x27;s a great university - you can feel that they really care about students. They care about Ukraine, taking into account that the university prepares different specialists for the country. I thank each and every one who attended the meeting at the Polytechnic, who asked questions and who responded sincerely to the answers. It was a nice, energetic communication. This is exactly what we are fighting for for the whole of Ukraine – for all our children, all Ukrainian students in every part of our country to feel free, enjoy freedom, get an education and realize themselves in life as they want. And this will happen. Ukraine will defend its freedom. I also held a special coordination meeting in Zhytomyr with all those responsible for the region. We discussed in detail the security, economic and social situation in the region. We have made decisions, in particular, to restore the energy sector after the Russian strikes. We are already preparing our energy sector for the next winter. There are also decisions on educational infrastructure - the Minister of Education and Science took part in the meeting today. Of course, we will help our regions, and Zhytomyr region in particular, with school buses. Special attention was paid to the border. There was a report by the Head of the Zhytomyr Regional Military Administration and the Head of the State Border Guard Service. We talked about the protection, arrangement of the border, and the situation in general. I am grateful to everyone who ensures the strength of our state border. And by the way, I would like to recognize our border guards today - those who, together with all the defense forces of our country, are defending Ukraine on the frontline. There is much to thank them for. Luhansk and Kramatorsk border guard detachments - thank you, soldiers, for your steadfastness in Bakhmut! Lutsk border guard detachment - thank you guys for your strength in the Avdiivka area! Kherson and Berdyansk border guard detachments - thank you for the successful completion of tasks in the south of our country. Well done to all of you! Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat, at combat posts, on combat missions! Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine defend itself against Russian evil! I thank Zhytomyr for today. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every manifestation of Russian terror is an additional argument that everything should end in the Tribunal - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-25</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! All our partners in the world! Throughout the day today, the rubble in the city of Kupyansk, Kharkiv region, was being cleared after a Russian attack with S-300 missiles. Attack on an ordinary civilian neighborhood. The terrorists targeted the local history museum and nearby houses. Russia killed two women with this strike. My condolences to the families and friends of the victims... Ten people were wounded, they are being provided with the necessary assistance. In total, more than 60 museums and galleries in different regions of our country have been destroyed or damaged by the occupier. Today, a church was destroyed by Russian aircraft in the Kherson region. In the village of Kizomys, Bilozerka community. An Orthodox church... By a guided bomb. That is, the Russian military knew what they were destroying. This church became one of hundreds of churches and prayer houses destroyed by Russian strikes. Crimea... Today the occupiers broke into the house of Abdureshyt Dzhepparov. He is one of the representatives of the Crimean Tatar national movement, a human rights activist, a citizen of Ukraine. It is unknown where he is now and what his condition is. This is another example of Russian repression against the indigenous people of Crimea, against all our people. There have been thousands and thousands of such examples since the beginning of aggression both in Crimea and in our other regions occupied by Russia. No one can feel safe anywhere unless the aggressor is defeated. This is what every day in Ukraine proves – everything that the Russian troops and special services of the occupier are doing on our land against our people. And this is what they dream of bringing to the lands of other nations. The whole world knows this. The world also knows that Russia can be stopped. This is a common interest. Stopped by the might of our warriors on the frontline. By our weapons, both Ukrainian and those we receive from our partners. By the power of law, that is, sanctions that need to be constantly enhanced, and by our joint work for justice. Every manifestation of Russian terror, every day of aggression is an additional argument that all this must end in the Tribunal - in a new Nuremberg against ruscism, against those who destroy lives and people, who use missiles against museums and guided bombs against churches. Russia must lose. The world cannot have any other goal. For anything else is a defeat of life, a defeat of law, a defeat of the world itself. Today, our international sanctions group, a group of experts headed by Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul, presented a document on strengthening sanctions against Russia. The first such sanctions plan was implemented by more than 70%. So now we have presented the areas in which sanctions pressure can be further enhanced and ways to ensure the world greater stability through the complete exclusion of all destructive Russian actors, all those who work for war, from global relations. This document on sanctions will be on the desks of all the key leaders of the world - political, public, and business leaders. Sanctions against the Russian oil and gas sector, against the nuclear industry, against absolutely anyone who helps Russia circumvent the restrictions already in place. This is a necessary self-defense of the international legal order. Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. Commanders, Commander-in-Chief, intelligence, Ministry of Defense. There were reports on the current situation at the front, on our ability to move actively, and the manning of new units. Today we also talked about Ramstein and further communication with our partners. I also held a meeting on Ukraine&#x27;s economic recovery. Shmyhal, Svyrydenko, Shurma, Kubrakov, Fedorov are our recovery team. They presented the economic strategy for today and for the postwar period. It is already clear that our victory will result in Ukraine&#x27;s ability to be a real security provider for all our partners, for everyone in the world who values a rules-based international order. The new security standards that we will implement in our life: in our infrastructure, energy, logistics and communications, social and educational spheres, in our production - all this can be scaled up in other parts of the world. The same goes for Ukrainian defense systems, our weapons, and the experience of our people gained in confronting Russian terror. All this will work for global peace to ensure that no one in the world will ever repeat Russia&#x27;s crimes. Glory to each of our warriors who are now in combat, at combat posts, on combat missions! Today I would like to celebrate the 80th airborne assault brigade. Well done, guys! Thank you for your resolve in destroying the occupier in Bakhmut! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine has a unique experience of protecting the state and people in the conditions of aggression, so we invite Italy to build a new security of the world together - President at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-26</span></div>
  <p>Madam Prime Minister of Italy! Mr. Prime Minister of Ukraine! Madam Vice President of the General Confederation of Italian Industry! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants! Dear Italy! Thank you for this Conference and your sincere interest in Ukraine. I know that hundreds of Italian and Ukrainian companies are listening to me, and I would like to address you not just as those who represent business, but also as fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, as representatives of your communities, your cities, your country... Here are completely different people, different families, different generations, but we are united by the same aspirations in fact. We all want freedom and normal development for our children, we want security and well-being for our parents. We want peace and ease of life for our communities and cities... and this unites us. And this is what I suggest talking about. About ways for us to give more security to our families. More prosperity for our countries. More freedom for Ukrainian and Italian children. More guarantees of normalcy for our communities and for our cities. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is already clear when and how this war that Russia has unleashed against us should end. Against all of us. Against Ukraine and our common European home, which gave all European nations a chance for peaceful life and prosperity. I have no doubt that we can win. Because we not only believe in our strength, but also stand strong and defend our common values in unity. In unity! Those who remain united and do not lose strength win. I want to thank all of Italy, all of your people and communities, your leadership, and personally Madam Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni for this unity... Thank you! The unity of Europeans who know that there can be no normal and safe life outside of our freedom, where Russia wants to push all of us in Europe. We have to do everything – and we will! – to ensure that this Russian war ends in Russian defeat. Hence, this year already, we have to do everything to prepare the largest economic project of our time in Europe - the project of rebuilding Ukraine. This is a colossal task! Europe has not seen this scale of destruction that Russia has brought to Ukraine since World War II. But it was after World War II that Europe saw what real reconstruction brings. What growth it brings. We are now on the eve of no lesser opportunities. In this war, the world has seen what is needed to really protect every nation. The world has seen how to change the energy sector and infrastructure, production and logistics, cyber systems and education, the defense industry and army equipment... Therefore, there is a demand in the world for new security standards so that every country can protect itself from any manifestations of aggression, terror or the elements. And we in Ukraine are creating such security standards. I&#x27;ll give you five examples that will demonstrate the practical meaning of what I&#x27;m talking about. The first is energy. Russia has launched a real energy aggression against Europe. It provoked a price crisis and impoverished millions of families through shocking bill increases. It tried to prevent the physical supply of fuel to Europe. It fired missiles and Iranian drones at our energy sector so that Ukrainians would be left without electricity and heat in the winter... Europe has withstood. We have responded to this challenge with dignity. And now we have to do everything to ensure that the enemy does not have even a theoretical opportunity to disrupt our energy sector. Green energy transformation and a kind of decentralization of production is the answer. The more green energy producers, the more resilient the system is. The more sources of supply, the more securely every city, every community, and every family is supplied. Moreover, Italy is one of the leaders in creating smart grids. Therefore, I invite your companies to develop Ukrainian grids together. And please don&#x27;t forget that in the near future, Ukrainian grids will be the grids of the European Union. The second is the actual construction. Ukrainians will never give up their country to the enemy and will never leave their land. Even though hundreds of our villages and dozens of cities have been burned by Russian artillery and air strikes, Ukrainians are able to bring them back to life. It is not in the habit of our people to leave unhealed wounds on their land. We have a tremendous need to rebuild thousands of homes, hundreds of schools, hospitals, transport and industrial infrastructure… On a new security basis that should become typical for other countries, for cities in those countries where people may not think about security in good times. But they realize that guarantees are needed. For every parent not to worry about their child at school, because there is a shelter, a safe place that guarantees protection. For every mother to know that in her community, in her city, the security infrastructure is so well-organized that any terrorist - whether a state like Russia or a terrorist organization - will definitely lose to the existing security system. I invite your companies to plan, design and build with us such a safe future for us and all those who want to import a similar level of security to their own countries. The third example is technology. Russia&#x27;s full-scale aggression has not broken Ukrainian finances, the banking system, or the digital services to which our people are accustomed. We have preserved the country&#x27;s communications and all the things without which modern life is unimaginable. Moreover, we have engaged our IT specialists in cyber defense of the state and economy. We have built the country&#x27;s cyber defense. We continue to develop the Diia public service, which provides access to public services via a smartphone or a web portal. Moreover, our partners in Europe are already adopting our Diia for their digital development. Our defense industry is gaining momentum even now, when the war is still ongoing. We are interested in localizing the production of military equipment we receive from our partners in Ukraine. We are building new production facilities for our own weapons and ammunition. We are creating new defense tools such as a fleet of naval drones, a wide range of drones for our front. I am sure your companies have something to add to these Ukrainian success stories. The fourth is global markets. The world has already realized the potential of our country&#x27;s agricultural sector. Ukraine is able to guarantee global food stability. Supplies from Ukraine put food on the tables of millions of families in different countries, including Africa and Asia... From Algeria to Ethiopia, from Lebanon to Yemen. Without our supplies, chaos would reign in some countries. This means there would be new waves of migration, including to Europe. In addition, Ukraine has a significant potential for green metallurgy that can’t be found anywhere else in Europe. From iron ore to lithium and other resources that are in high demand around the world – Ukraine has it all. From natural gas to titanium... We can and will supply all this to global markets. In many ways, we can replace companies from Russia – those who chose to work for war rather than global development. But the top priority task is processing. This means new enterprises. This means new logistics and modernization of transport. This means new investments. This means profits. And, I&#x27;m sure, for your companies as well. And the fifth example, and this is not the last of the opportunities for cooperation, is pharmaceuticals and rehabilitation. There is a purely economic fact: Ukraine is a huge market and a net importer of pharmaceuticals. This alone means that localization of production in Ukraine brings obvious benefits. But the war has added another level to this industry. I am talking about people who need rehabilitation after being wounded. About those whose lives are poisoned by post-traumatic and other disorders. About those who went through Russian captivity and occupation – where there is no basic medical care... To end the war means, among other things, to heal the pain that was experienced in the war, brought from the war, and associated with the war... Obviously, we will work on this in Ukraine together with the best representatives of the world. Ukraine sees what the key security demand is. Ukraine has a unique experience in protecting the state and people in the face of aggression and all possible manifestations of terror... There is no evil that Russia has not tried to do against Ukrainians and from which we do not have to defend ourselves. Our experience of protection is successful and scalable to the lives of other peoples and other countries. It is logical that our experience will become part of the new security foundation of the world. I invite you, Italy, to build a new security with us! I invite your businesses, your investments, your experience to come to Ukraine right now. Please do not hesitate to contact our delegation at the Conference, Mr. Prime Minister of Ukraine... Ukraine is willing to cooperate! Glory to everyone who brings our victory closer! Grazie Italia! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Now there is an opportunity to give new impetus to relations between Ukraine and China - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-26</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, I would like to thank our entire team involved in the exchanges. We managed to return 44 more people from Russian captivity to Ukraine. Most of them are servicemen. From various directions. Among them are defenders of Azovstal and Mariupol, other cities in Donetsk, Kherson, Kharkiv regions... Most of them are privates and sergeants. Some are officers. Two of them are civilians. And it&#x27;s important that the team works on all those who are in captivity... Even if it is particularly difficult, as with some categories of captives. And these are not only prisoners of war who are difficult to return, but also, for example, civilian captives – one of those difficult categories. We remember everyone. And even if there is no exact information about a particular person, about what happened to them or where they might be, they are still being searched for and everything is being checked as much as possible. Ukraine must return all its people. I am thankful to all of you guys who coordinate this work: Budanov, Yermak, Lubinets, Usov, Malyuk, Klymenko... I thank each and every one who helps in the Main Intelligence Directorate, the Office, the Security Service of Ukraine and our other structures. Of course, I am grateful to all our warriors on the frontline who are replenishing the exchange fund. Every Russian prisoner of war is an opportunity to exchange our people. In total, 2279 Ukrainians have already been returned from Russian captivity during the full-scale war. I spoke with the leader of China today. It was a long and quite rational conversation. It is usually said that such conversations open up opportunities. Now there is an opportunity to give new impetus to our relations – Ukraine and China. There is an opportunity to use China&#x27;s political influence to restore the strength of the principles and rules on which peace should be based. Ukraine and China, as well as the vast majority of the world, are equally interested in the strength of the sovereignty of nations and territorial integrity... In compliance with the main security rules, in particular, the inadmissibility of threats with nuclear weapons and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world. We are equally interested in ensuring that the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is finally fully secured and that nuclear power plants are never used for military purposes again, which is exactly the kind of cynical use Russia is trying to make the norm. It is very important that China shares our view of freedom of navigation and trade. I briefed Mr. Xi Jinping on our efforts to restore seaborne food exports. And I heard words of support for our Black Sea Grain Initiative and its extension, as well as support for our humanitarian efforts, in particular the Grain from Ukraine program. Of course, an essential part of the conversation is our views on ways to restore a just peace. I presented the Ukrainian Peace Formula, its specific points. We agreed to continue our communications. Today, I took part in a conference in Rome dedicated to the reconstruction of our country. This is a special format of communication between government officials and representatives of industry and business from our countries, Ukraine and Italy. This is a special format of communication between the governments and representatives of industry and business of our countries, Ukraine and Italy, for us to be able to directly attract to Ukraine those who personify the economic power of Italy. I thank Mrs. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni for this conference and for her words of unflagging support for Ukraine. It is important that we are already planning our cooperation in 2024. In particular, this concerns the upcoming Italian presidency of the G7, as well as the preparation of a major donor conference on recovery. I had a separate phone call with Giorgia. The key topic was defense cooperation and support for our warriors. Thank you, Italy! These days, we are also working with our partners to coordinate defense and supply activities. It is very important for Ukraine that everyone who works with us to defend freedom clearly understands what prospects our strength has and what we can do. The better we understand each other, the easier it is to work for a common victory. For obvious reasons, we are not disclosing the details of such communication in public yet. One more thing. Today I spoke with IAEA Director Grossi. The anniversary of the Chornobyl disaster is the right day to remind everyone in the world how fragile our security is. And even more so when the threat of a radiation catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, artificially created by Russia, has been looming every day and every minute for more than a year already. Only Ukraine&#x27;s full control over the ZNPP can restore full security not only for our country, but also for the entire Europe and the whole world. Radiation does not recognize state borders, just like the Russian Federation. And only full compliance with the rules can guarantee safety. I would also like to thank Mr. Grossi for his initiative - a very important social initiative - of such a special medical support program for the personnel of all our nuclear power plants. Thank you for supporting our people! Thank you to everyone who helps us fight against aggression! Glory to all Ukrainian warriors who are now in combat, at combat posts and on combat missions! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will keep working for the return of all deported Ukrainian children and for the punishment of Russia - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-27</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, there was an important political result in Strasbourg at the session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. A resolution was adopted recognizing that Russia&#x27;s deportation of Ukrainian children has evidence of genocide. This is the first recognition of this fact at the level of such a high international organization uniting the states of our continent. Practically speaking, this decision will significantly help our global efforts to bring Russia and its officials, including the head of the terrorist state, to justice for genocide and genocidal policies against Ukraine. The deportation of Ukrainian children is one of the fully premeditated elements of Russia&#x27;s attempt to erase the identity of our people, to destroy the very essence of Ukrainians. This is a deliberate crime of genocide committed by Russian officials. This is how it should be qualified both politically and legally. Today, the First Lady of Ukraine addressed PACE - specifically on the issue of children and families... Our parliamentarians and our diplomats have done a good job. And at all levels - formal and informal, with leaders of states, at the parliamentary, governmental, law enforcement levels, in the legal community and in international and inter-parliamentary organizations - we will keep working for the return of all deported Ukrainian children and for the punishment of Russia. We know for sure the data of almost 20 thousand children who were taken away and dispersed to different regions of the evil state. But it is obvious that this is only a part of much larger criminal actions. There may be many more such children. Europe and the world have already seen various deportations and attempts to exterminate peoples. It is through the Russian example - the accountability of this state and its officials guilty of genocide - that we must show all other potential sources of the same evil that there will never be impunity. There will be sentences for genocide. Just as for all other crimes committed by Russia against Ukraine and our people. In Mykolaiv, the debris has been cleared from the site of a rocket attack that took place last night. More than 20 people were wounded, one person was killed... My condolences to the families and friends. The rockets damaged dozens of ordinary houses and two educational institutions. &quot;Kalibrs&quot; against a school and a college, against residential buildings. In the evening, another rocket attack was launched at Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region. A school, hospital and residential buildings were damaged. Unfortunately, there are people injured. Unfortunately, the world&#x27;s legal machine is taking a long time to gain momentum. But it is gaining momentum. Unfortunately, the world&#x27;s political pressure on the terrorist state, the sanctions pressure, has not yet reached its full force. But it is reaching... But our warriors have been doing absolutely everything possible to protect people and humanity since the first day of this battle! And even more than possible. Avdiivka - the 35th separate marine brigade. Maryinka – our famous &quot;Seventy-ninth&quot;... The entire Donetsk sector – the 55th separate artillery brigade... Thank you, warriors, for your consistent efficiency! Zaporizhzhia direction - today, as always, we have a lot to thank the warriors of our 44th separate artillery brigade for. Well done! Today, I conveyed written gratitude to the warriors and the commander of the 95th separate airborne assault brigade who are fighting vigorously near Kreminna, Luhansk region. I would also like to thank absolutely everyone who is defending Bakhmut and destroying the enemy there on a scale that the occupier deserves. Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat, at combat posts, on combat missions! Thank you to everyone in the world who helps us! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We can stop terror and save people only with a sufficient number of high-quality weapons – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-28</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! The demolition of rubble in Uman, at the site hit by the Russian missile, continued all day. At the moment, it is known about 23 dead, among them four children. My condolences to families and friends... All those who were saved – residents of this building and neighboring buildings, which, unfortunately, were affected by the blast wave – are provided with the necessary assistance. I thank everyone who participated in the rescue operation and supports the rescued people. A missile on Uman, a city that is absolutely peaceful, known to the whole world for hosting tens of thousands of Hasidic pilgrims every year... Only absolute evil can unleash such terror against Ukraine. Two Ukrainian women were killed in Dnipropetrovsk region in today&#x27;s missile attack. Mother and daughter. Olha, born in 1992, and Veronika, born in 2020. This child has not yet turned three years old! Eternal memory!.. Condolences to the family, condolences to loved ones... Today, our Air Force managed to shoot down most of the Russian missiles – 21 out of 23. If not for this, the terrorist state would have managed to claim many more casualties, more lives. And this proves once again that we can stop terror and save people only with weapons. Air defense, modern aircraft, without which there is no fully effective air defense. Artillery, armored vehicles. All that is necessary to provide security to our cities, our villages, both in the rear and on the front lines. To restore security to our people who are still, unfortunately, in the occupied territory. Temporarily. We cannot leave anyone under the power of Russian evil. Today, the President of Slovakia and the President of the Czech Republic visited Kyiv. We talked about how to give protection to all our people, to speed up the return of peace and order in all the land. I thanked Slovakia and the Czech Republic for their support: for the provided weapons, political and sanctions assistance, and for the support of people who received shelter in the Slovak and Czech communities. I outlined to the partners what prospects we have on the battlefield now and what further help we need to go all this necessary way. I informed on what we are doing to implement our Peace Formula, in particular, the point regarding bringing those responsible for aggression to justice. I&#x27;m thankful that Slovakia and the Czech Republic see the need to restore justice and punish war criminals, to punish all these terrorists. We signed a Joint Declaration with the President of Slovakia and the President of the Czech Republic regarding our European and Euro-Atlantic movement. I also spoke today with President of the European Council Charles Michel. I informed him about the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack and thanked him for supporting our defense, our economic, and our social stability. We separately discussed with the President of the European Council the situation around the destructive, in my opinion, ban on the import of our agricultural products by certain states. I emphasize that this not only violates the existing Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union but also gives dangerous hope to the Kremlin. The hope that in our common European home, someone&#x27;s wrong decisions can prevail over common interests. Now, when Russia violates the freedom of trade, tries to block the supply of agricultural products to the world market, it is definitely not the time for anyone to follow the evil state and do something similar. It is necessary to find a normal, constructive way out of this situation in the European spirit. The difficult one. The decision that would take into account the interests of all our countries and Europe in general. We have discussed with Mr. Michel how this can be done, what the solution can be, and we are in constant contact with all partners. Today, a significant investment event for Ukraine took place – the first major investment in Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. The size of the investment is $250 million, and this is only the start of the relevant package. Right now, when we are still fighting against Russian terror, big world business not only believes in our victory, but also confirms this belief with its multimillion-dollar investments and concrete steps. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle, at combat posts, on combat missions! Thank you to the people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Not enough that Russia is weak, it must be held accountable for everything it has done – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-29</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Search and rescue operations were completed in Uman only this afternoon. I want to thank the entire team of the State Emergency Service, the National Police, our doctors, Uman utility services, the military, our volunteers – everyone who took part in the rescue operation and helped the rescued people. I wish a speedy recovery to everyone who was injured by this blow and was traumatized. We will do everything possible to make the terrorist state answer as soon as possible for what it has done. Anyone who prepares such missile attacks cannot but know that he will be an accomplice in the murder. Anyone, who guides and launches missiles, who handles planes and ships for terror. Not only those who give orders but all of you, you are all terrorists and murderers and you must all be punished. And definitely – those who committed the primordial crime, from which all others began – the crime of aggression against our people, against our state. Six children lost their lives in this attack on Uman, a total of 23 people died... May their memory be bright! My condolences to all relatives and friends! Next week will be quite important from the point of view of our struggle for justice for Ukrainians, that is, for punishment for the terrorist state and all its war criminals. We are preparing several important, potent steps to further consolidate partners and provide more energy to creating a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression. And to speed up the defeat of the terrorist state. It is not enough for Ukraine and the world that Russia is weak, as it is already happening. It must fully answer for everything it has done. We are also preparing new sanctions decisions against individuals and companies involved in the terrorists&#x27; defense industry and against foreign entities, which supplies help Russia extend this aggression. Our decisions will be made public soon. Recently, I signed new decrees awarding our defenders, our heroes. Almost 450 more soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ground Forces, paratroopers, Air Force, territorial defense, and over 300 more – from the National Guard, our police, State Emergency Service, and our border guards. In total, during the full-scale war, 45,038 Ukrainian men and women were awarded state awards. And it is evidence of the extraordinary daily heroism of our people. All those who fight for the sake of Ukraine, all those who work for our victory. Glory to all who are in battle for our country, at combat posts! Glory to all who train our soldiers! Glory to everyone who treats and rehabilitates after injuries, who rebuilds life after Russian shelling and occupation. Who returns our people from Russian captivity. I thank everyone in the world who helps us! It is important now. We highly appreciate it. Together, we are bringing the verdict for the evil state closer. We are nearing our victory. So be it! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The invader will definitely not succeed in taking away our peace, which is a natural part of the Ukrainian character - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-30</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we celebrate the professional day of our border guards in Ukraine. They were the first to face the occupier in the east, they are holding the border firmly - from Volyn to Kharkiv region, and they will definitely return to all points of our state border in Donbas and Crimea. The day will surely come when Ukrainian border control for passengers at the international airports of our Donetsk and Simferopol will once again be quite commonplace. The invader will definitely not succeed in taking away our peace, which is a natural part of the Ukrainian character... Peace and the desire for freedom for our entire state, for all our regions, cities, and communities. We will definitely gain it. I would like to especially celebrate our border guards, who, together with all the defense and security forces of Ukraine, are defending our country and our people in the battles in Donbas... The most fierce areas... Maryinka, Bakhmut, Lyman... Thank you, warriors! I would also like to mention the fighters of the Lutsk border guard detachment who are defending the Avdiivka direction... Very powerful! Thank you! Southern directions, where the units of our border guards always effectively &quot;subtract&quot; the occupier... Thank you! Thank you to the servicemen of the Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv detachments who are defending our border with the terrorist state! Thank you to everyone who strengthens our border in Volyn, Rivne, Zhytomyr and Kyiv regions! I spoke with French President Macron - as always, it was a long and meaningful conversation. We are coordinating our positions to give even more strength to our soldiers and to speed up the end of the war with our victory. I am grateful to France and to Emmanuel personally for supporting our country and our people. Now, in this conversation, Mr. President has confirmed the supply of exactly what I mentioned in the previous conversation. The speed and specificity of the response is very important, it is something that greatly enhances our capabilities. Thank you for this arms package! It is very important that Russia receives ever stronger signals that the world will not forgive any of Russia&#x27;s acts of terror. And that as many global players as possible are absolutely principled in upholding the sanctions regime against Russia for terror. I thank each and every person in the world who helps strengthen the isolation of terrorists and stop any supply of weapons and their components to terrorists, who works to block the Russian military-industrial complex and to strengthen the defense capabilities of the whole of Europe. Following this week, I would like to especially thank our partners from Denmark for Caesars; Slovenia for armored vehicles; Spain for tanks; and Germany for additional defense intentions regarding armored vehicles and shells, and for air defense… I am grateful to America for funding in the amount of USD 1 billion 250 million to support our budget and resilience. I am grateful to the Netherlands for the parliamentary decision to train Ukrainian soldiers on advanced Western systems. I am grateful to Italy for its efforts to rebuild our country as soon as possible. I am grateful to Croatia for its new assistance in the treatment of our defenders after being wounded in combat. Remaining as united as possible, maintaining the greatest principled stance to protect our common values and implementing defense agreements as fast as possible, all together in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world, we will be able to prevent Russia from protracting the war and restore a normal, just peace. Glory to all who are in combat for Ukraine! Blessed memory to all our heroes of different times who gave their lives for independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russian invaders will receive our response to every attack - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-01</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I started this Monday and the new week with an hour-long meeting with all levels of government and defense. The head of government, ministers, the Office. The Commander-in-Chief, the heads of the Main Intelligence Directorate and the Foreign Intelligence Service, the head of the Security Service, and the NSDC Secretary delivered reports. The first issue is the consequences of Russian strikes, including missile attacks. Last night alone, from midnight to seven in the morning, we managed to shoot down 15 Russian missiles. But, unfortunately, not all of them. Not all of them yet. We are working with our partners as actively as possible to make the protection of our skies even more reliable. At the morning meeting, we discussed the enemy&#x27;s likely actions in the near future and coordinated our defensive steps. Separately we discussed the issue of weapons and ammunition for our warriors. Also, the situation on the still occupied territory and counteraction to Russia. No chance for the occupier on our land! Only destruction for the enemy. Here is just one example today. Chernihiv region, the village of Lyzunivka, in the north of the region, near the state border. There, a Russian air bomb destroyed another Ukrainian school... Unfortunately, this strike took the life of a teenager - a boy born in 2009... 14 years old! He was just near the school. My condolences to the family and friends! Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk region. Terrorists’ missiles claimed the lives of two people, young guys... My condolences to the families! Forty more people - women, children and men - received medical aid after injuries and traumas. For every such attack, the Russian invaders will receive our response. And I thank all our warriors who ensure this every day and every night. They defend our positions, repel Russian assaults, help their brothers-in-arms who are nearby in the positions, and destroy the occupier to the maximum. The more Ukrainians are accurate, the more Ukrainians support each other, the faster the Russian evil will be destroyed. I am grateful to all our partners who see the common task of Ukraine and the world in this way: the obvious defeat of the terrorist state and a just peace for Ukraine and the whole of Europe. Today, I held several meetings on our diplomatic work in May, which brings us closer to such a peace - a just peace, such an outcome of this war - the defeat of the occupier. I also had several phone calls today. I thanked Canada and Prime Minister Trudeau personally for the continued support of our country. We are preparing a program of long-term defense cooperation between Ukraine and Canada. This is very important: Canada has already started confiscating Russian assets. This is a significant example for everyone else in the world. We discussed sanctions pressure and our political cooperation. Today I also spoke with Prime Minister Hipkins of New Zealand. I thanked him for the principled stance in defense of international law - New Zealand is often among the leaders in sanctions restrictions. I also thanked for New Zealand&#x27;s participation in training our soldiers. We agreed to work on greater consolidation of the Pacific region countries to protect international rules. And one more thing. Today marks the tenth anniversary of the foundation of one of Ukraine&#x27;s most glorious military units, the 140th separate special operations center. These are very skilled warriors - determined, strong and extremely experienced. They took part in the defense and liberation of the Kyiv region - Bucha, Hostomel, Borodyanka and other towns and villages, as well as the liberation of Izyum and Chuhuiv in the Kharkiv region. They carried out strategically important missions in the southern areas and fought hard against the occupiers in Donbas. Thank you, warriors! Ukraine will always remember your courage, and will never forget those warriors who gave their lives in the battle for the state. May our country&#x27;s victory in this war honor them! Glory to all those who are in combat for Ukraine! Glory to all who protect and save our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are preparing a large sanctions package, the decision will be made soon - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-02</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report of the day. The first point is the military cabinet. This is a special work with key commanders and those who provide defense. Obviously this is confidential work, its details are undisclosed. But just like the meetings of the Staff, the military cabinet also works regularly to synchronize our most important defensive and offensive actions. The second point is sanctions. I held a meeting on strengthening sanctions regimes, both our own and those of our partners. We are closely monitoring how the terrorist state is trying to circumvent sanctions, recording each such direction, and working together with our partners to block it. We are preparing a large sanctions package. The decision will be made soon. Third, international events. This May and the following months will be quite active for Ukraine in the international sphere. There will be a lot of negotiations-related work, international events that will strengthen our defense. We are working on everything. Today I held several meetings on what is planned for this week and for the near future. Fourth, I held a meeting with Prime Minister Shmyhal. Coordination and preparation of decisions. We are preparing conceptual security solutions for the development of Ukraine and our infrastructure, both now and after the war. We are also preparing for the planned international meetings on the reconstruction of Ukraine and relevant negotiations with partners. And fifth, today&#x27;s international meetings and conversations. I met with a delegation of the Portuguese Assembly headed by the President of the Assembly. It was a productive meeting. I thanked them for supporting our country and people. The topic of the conversation is quite broad, but the main thing is what unites us... Security for all Europeans, stability, and therefore further development and strengthening of the European and Euro-Atlantic community. In this context, I noted what decisions we expect from the partners&#x27; summit in Vilnius in July, the NATO summit. Today I spoke with the Chairperson of the African Union, the President of the Comoros. It was an important conversation and important mutual understanding. I thanked for the support on global platforms, in particular at the UN. I invited him to join the implementation of our Peace Formula and assured that Ukraine is ready to be a reliable guarantor of food security. We are doing everything to eliminate any damage from Russian aggression both for our people and all our partners. I thank everyone in the world who supports Ukraine! Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat for the sake of our country, at combat posts and on combat missions! Today I would like to especially celebrate the warriors of the 77th separate airmobile and 93rd separate mechanized brigades defending the Bakhmut direction. They are really effective! Thank you, guys! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The Hague is becoming a real hub of justice for all victims of aggression and other international crimes - address by the President of Ukraine in the Dutch Parliament</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-04</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! It’s an honor to address you – the representatives of both houses of the Parliament of the Netherlands, the chairpersons of the parliamentary committees, and you, honorable speakers of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the States General. When democracy is real with a stable tradition in the country, the parliament is the heart of such country. I’m sure that the heart of the Netherlands today will feel what the hearts of Ukrainians long for. A year has passed since I addressed the Parliament and the people of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the first time. On the thirty-sixth day of the full-scale war, I spoke about why you and I and all Europeans, the whole world should unite… Unite to defend freedom and human lives. A year ago, I said that this war cannot be forgiven – none of the crimes committed by Russia. I said that The Hague knew exactly – how to bring all Russian murderers to justice. And today is the time to thank all of you, your great country and your leadership. I’m grateful to you for the fact that we’ve achieved the greatest unity in Europe, which people only dreamed of for decades. And it wouldn&#x27;t have happened without the Netherlands – without your leadership. I am grateful to you for helping to protect what you value. The Netherlands defends freedom, defends the rule of law and democracy, defends Europe and our common way of life – the lives of free people… Free not at the expense of someone else&#x27;s slavery, but thanks to the rights and respect for all, – this is our Europe. No aggressor will now think that he can burn the values of our Europe in the fire of aggression! It seemed to Russia that Europe was weak. Well, now Russia tries to figure out how to hide its own weakness. I’m grateful to you that The Hague, a city associated with international law in the world, is becoming a real hub of justice… Justice in the name of all those who suffered from aggression and other international crimes. This is the year of our cooperation with you! I’m here to thank everyone in the Netherlands. Everyone… From the parliament to the smallest community, from His Majesty the King and the Royal Family to every citizen of the Netherlands, from the Government and to every family that helped us - my great appreciation - helped Ukrainians who found refuge in your country… Thank all of you! Together we&#x27;re truly making life protected. Ladies and Gentlemen! It&#x27;s time now to identify new issues to take stock of the year. Issues that are important not only for Ukraine but for all Europe and everyone in the world who values freedom the same way you and I do. I will mention three points. The first one: Ukrainians are united by the desire to win. But it is not only our desire to win back what belongs to us. And we definitely don&#x27;t want to grab someone else&#x27;s. We want to destroy the villainy with which the terrorist state came. The villainy is when Russian anti-ship missiles strike ordinary shopping centres… Yesterday and the day before yesterday… Each week we see something like this terrible tragedy… The villainy is when a terrorist state has a goal to leave the neighboring nation in winter in total blackout… The villainy is when Russia occupies a nuclear power plant, puts multiple launch rocket systems on its territory and, under the cover of nuclear reactors, fires at neighbouring towns... All this concentrated villainy should lose together with Russia. And when the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag returns freedom to the lands occupied by Russia, in parallel with this, the terrorist state must feel that the world does not want even to cross paths with Russia and anything Russian. So, yes – to sanctions. Yes – to Russia’s isolation. Yes – to the pressure on Russian citizens to make them looking for the regime change in their country. Yes – to sentences for the terror. Yes – to universal rules for all jurisdictions to seize Russian assets and use them to compensate for damages from aggression. We have to achieve this to the maximum to bring joint peace faster! The second point. This summer Europe has a historic opportunity to cut off oxygen to Russian revanchism once and for all. NATO July Summit is quite the time that allows to remove the security uncertainty in Europe. Can you imagine that a part of your country… let’s say – Eindhoven or Groningen… could be outside the common security and legal space of the Netherlands? In a &quot;gray zone&quot;, which will attract the attention of international criminals. It&#x27;s impossible, it&#x27;s absurd. The same way, it is impossible and absurd to leave Ukraine outside of the security and legal space of our common homeland – Europe. Ukraine should receive a decision on the algorithm for joining the Alliance. It is clear that we cannot join NATO now, while the war is going on, but it is possible and necessary to remove the security uncertainty now – it is a political decision. Russia must see that Ukraine’s security will be guaranteed in order to begin to realize itself, Russia, only within its own borders. I call on the Netherlands to make this strategically important decision for the security of Europe! Decision on Ukraine and NATO. And the third point. Defence means people – armed people. The more powerful the weapon and the longer the fire range is, the more lives are saved from enemy strikes. So, cherishing the value of life and maintaining defensive taboos among allies who are supposed to protect life – is an obvious contradiction. The longer the taboos on weapons persist – the more our soldiers give their lives on maintaining the defense when the weapons are not powerful or not long-ranged enough… or when Russian fighter jets are more effective than the aircrafts of those who really defend Europe. As of now, all this persists unfortunately… the taboos on weapons. Is it for a long time? It depends on all of us. Ladies and Gentlemen! We remember the leadership of the Netherlands in initiating the delivery of the Panzerhaubitze 2000. We are grateful for such a brave decision, for your Patriot system and other weapons. We remember that the Netherlands were the first to say that the F16 – is not a taboo… Your leadership truly provides results. So let&#x27;s together provide new ones! I believe that during my next visit – I believe I will have it, of course if you invite me after this meeting – I will be able also only to thank you – the way I do it today. I believe that Ukrainians and all Europeans will be able to thank you, in particular, for bringing the peace closer and for saved lives… Saved by joint actions as we’ve already seen. May we never forget all men and women, children and adults, whose lives were taken away by wars! And glory to every hero who fights for life to win! To win now! Thank you for your attention, for your support! Слава Україні!</p>

  <p>First of all, I would like to thank you for your attention and respect for Ukraine that I have felt today. This is attention and respect from people who value freedom and do not tolerate tyranny as much as we do not in Ukraine! Thank you! Dear Minister Hoekstra! Dear members of Parliament! Dear ambassadors and journalists! Dear representatives of international organisations, political and judicial communities! Dear people of the Netherlands! I’m glad to be in your strong country now – the land of freedom and justice, which are universal values, and it is about these things that I will speak today. Of course, we all want to see a different Vladimir here, in The Hague. The one who deserves to be sentenced for his criminal actions right here, in the capital of international law. I’m sure we will see that happen, when we win. And we will win. And when we win not just on the battlefield, not just against this aggression. Look at how countries around the world are coming together to help Ukrainians defend themselves. What is at the heart of this desire to help? The feeling that more than the fate of one country is at stake. The feeling that more can be achieved than the defeat of one aggressor. We can now stop wars of aggression as such. We can defeat aggression as a criminal idea that originates in the mindset of someone who is used to impunity. Impunity is the key that opens the door to aggression. If you look at any war of aggression in history, they all have one thing in common – the perpetrators of the war did not believe they would have to stand to answer for what they did. They must stand to answer for war! Whoever brings war, must receive judgment. Ladies and Gentlemen! Defeating impunity of aggressors means destroying the origins of aggression. Victory in the war is won by force of arms – that&#x27;s how the job gets done. And I am grateful to you and the Netherlands for every piece of weapon supplied to Ukraine – for everything that helps us to maintain our defence and gradually prepare our active actions. But we know that the lasting peace after victory is achieved by nothing else but the strength of values. First of all, it’s the strength of freedom and of law, which must work to the full to ensure justice. Not hybrid promises instead of human rights, but real freedom. Not hybrid impunity and symbolic formalities, but full-scale justice. Not hybrid peace and constant flashes of violence on the frontline, but reliable peace. When one respects values - true freedom, true justice, true peace is respected instead of hybrid forms, but it’s exactly what we need now. Please think about one number. This number is – six thousand one hundred and thirty-nine. This is the number of war crimes committed by the Russian occupiers this April alone. These Russian crimes led to the death of two hundred and seven Ukrainian civilians. Among them are eleven children. Another seventeen children and four hundred adults were injured. In a month alone… And the full-scale Russian invasion has been going on for the fifteenth month. Just yesterday, in our Kherson region alone, Russia killed twenty-three people, forty-nine were wounded. I’m speaking about civilians. And it all started more than nine years ago with the occupation of Crimea and Russia&#x27;s bloody hybrid war in the Donbas. Thousands and thousands of war crimes, thousands and thousands of victims. The Russian rocket that killed twenty-three people in the city of Uman, and each of the millions of strikes fired by Russian artillery in the Donbas… Every person killed by the occupiers in Bucha and every filtration camp that Russia set up on our independent land... Every prisoner who was tortured in Russian captivity, and every city deliberately burned by Russia... And all the pain suffered by the Dutch people, after the downing of MH-17 flight with the use of the Russian weapons, by Russian hands… Exactly by Russian hands. Please observe a minute of silence in memory of all those whose lives were taken by Russia, by its terror. Thank you very much. Ladies and Gentleen! Friends! Only one Russian crime led to all of these crimes. This is a crime of aggression. The start of evil, the primary crime. There should be responsibility for this crime! And it can only be enforced by the Tribunal. Europe and the world have already had to deal with something like this. As a result, we can see the following words in the text of the judgment of the International Tribunal in Nuremberg: “To initiate a war of aggression, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that, it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole”. That’s absolutely true. We must transform the experience of the Nuremberg process into an operating rule! That’s why we insist on the Tribunal creation. When there is a tradition of inevitable punishment for aggression, then there will be a tradition of guaranteed non-repetition of aggression. If we want true justice, we should not look for excuses and should not refer to the shortcomings of current international law, but make bold decisions that will correct the shortcomings of those norms that, unfortunately, exist in international law. This is exactly what the creators of Nuremberg did. We should do the same now. It would be a weakness for you and for us and for all of the nations to leave full justice only to history. It would be unfair to our children and grandchildren to hand them problems that we can solve. That&#x27;s what the Tribunal is for. The sustainability of peace arises from the complete justice towards the aggressor. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is wrong that someone in the world is still afraid to give full force to justice. You and I are not afraid! I am sure most of the world is not afraid. The aggressor must fear the full power of justice. Only him! Yet this is our historical responsibility – of the modern generations – to make the total punishment for aggression inevitable; to prevent the aggression against our country and also new wars. There are potential aggressors in the world. And the world must seek justice to see peace fully secured. Ukrainian courts will ensure responsibility for most of the crimes of the Russian occupiers. I am thankful to the International Criminal Court and to the entire team working at and with the ICC for the sake of justice. But only one institution is capable of responding to the original crime – the crime of aggression. A Tribunal! Not something hybrid that can formally close the topic... Not some compromise that will allow politicians to say that the case is allegedly done... But a true, full-fledged Tribunal. True and full justice. And I am thankful to you, the people and leaders of the Netherlands, the Prime Minister, the Government, the Parliament for being with us on this path. It is so important for us. I thank you for supporting the establishment of the Special Tribunal. I am grateful that the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression will work right here in The Hague. Same here, in The Hague, the Register of damages from aggression will be established. And this is a step forward to creating a Compensation Mechanism: damages from aggression must be compensated at the expense of the assets of the aggressor himself. And this is also a punishment for war – as well as justice. I thank you for the fact that for you and us, justice really matters! Thank you, the Netherlands! Let justice really work! And when today, as always on the fourth of May, at eight o&#x27;clock in the evening, you will honor the memory of all those whose lives were taken away by wars – World War II and others – please also remember Ukrainians – men and women, adults and children, who would have been alive now but for this aggression. The war we didn&#x27;t want, the one we have to make the last. We’ll do it! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Two more areas added to United24: &quot;Education and Science&quot; and &quot;Demining&quot; – Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking at United24 Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-05</span></div>
  <p>Dear attendees! Ladies and Gentlemen! How many people are in this hall today? At first glance – hundreds. But, if we look more carefully, there are much more of us here today. A total of 110 countries are represented in this hall now. Thousands and thousands of human hearts that believe in the power of unity. Today, there are different cultures, many different difficult life stories, several human generations... From those who saw how the last century began, to those who will see how this century will end. Because older people and very young freedom helpers are together with United24. When we say &quot;United24,&quot; we mean a huge community of people – from Ukraine to North America, from Britain to Australia, from Japan to Latin America. The Arab world, India, absolutely all European countries. Already in the first year, the Ukrainian fundraising platform has become a global brand and global proof that nothing is impossible when you bet on the priority of the state of Ukraine – humanity. And we can reveal the amount: over $330 million in the first year. A round of applause! And it is very important. It&#x27;s a really big job. That&#x27;s how much our United24 fundraising team has accumulated. And it is the greatest achievement among all Ukrainian foundations. But, of course, we are grateful to absolutely everyone who works for the sake of Ukraine, for the sake of our victory, the victory of humanity. But what does it all mean? Such a number of people of such strength, with such help. All these are people who have heard Ukraine, who have accepted the way we see life, and who, together with us, are approaching the day when life will definitely win, when we will win this war. The Ukrainian day of our victory will surely come. In particular, thanks to each and every one of you here. And who is not here now, but constantly supported and built United24. So there will be a victory thanks to the United24 community. And I am grateful to everyone who helps us to go this way, to endure, to protect life! I thank our ambassadors. The world sees and hears you! I thank the team of our project – really strong and tireless. Well done! I thank everyone who works for the media support of United24 because the information is a weapon and we know it. I thank those who help keep the world&#x27;s attention on what our people are going through, our values are going through, Ukraine is going through... I thank everyone in the 110 countries who participate in our fundraising – every person, thank you to every family, every company, every business who joined our struggle, our common mission of United24! I thank you all! And, of course, we are all grateful to those for whom all this is raised. We are grateful to our soldiers, each and every one who is currently in battle, who is on combat missions, who is defending our state. Thanks to every Ukrainian hero! In our first year at United24, we focused on three areas. Defense and demining is the first. The second is Medical Aid. And the third is Rebuilding. Powerful things are being done! For example, United24 is helping to build the world&#x27;s first naval fleet of drones. And it&#x27;s very cool, and it&#x27;s exciting. And it also equips our soldiers with &quot;Shahed hunters&quot; to neutralize the murderous Russian and Iranian drones used by the aggressor. United24 helps equip our soldiers with the drones that are so needed on the front lines – today, yesterday, tomorrow. In general, these are already thousands of different types of drones! And we help train drone operators. In addition to the fact that United24 supplies the equipment for the defense of our country, we managed to prove that global fundraising for the sake of defense is real. And it is a significant achievement at the level of the ideas themselves. Perhaps such a change in attitude towards fundraising will help to restore peace, which is so needed not only for Ukraine... To restore peace not only for our state... People have seen what Ukraine is capable of. People have seen what unity is capable of. Ordinary people around the world actually directly help our army, our people because they know that the Ukrainian army defends the life that every adequate, normal person seeks for himself, his family, children, relatives, for everyone. A decent life that strengthens families, communities, and countries. It&#x27;s important that thanks to United24, more than 100 pieces of medical equipment have been purchased for children&#x27;s clinics, for hospitals – thank you very much. Also, almost 200 ambulances, and these are high-class ambulances. All this is already helping to save the lives of people in our frontline areas, in the areas bordering Russia and exposed to daily terrorist attacks... In addition, thanks to United24 donors, rebuilding has begun in Odesa, Dnipro, Rivne, and other Ukrainian cities. By the way, rebuilding two hospitals – Chernihiv City Hospital No. 3 and Chernihiv Medical Center of Modern Oncology. I am sure that our joint efforts will add many more results to the initial list of achievements of the United24 medical aid area. I want to note the assistance to Ukraine during this harsh winter, which we went through and went through so confidently despite any intimidation from our neighbors. It was really energy sustainability that we demonstrated to the whole world. I am very proud of it. And I am proud of you – those who supported, and our energy workers – they were great. Great job... Dozens of countries, companies, international organizations, and ordinary people have started to help with energy equipment, to help cope with the great shortage of generators, transformers, various technical means that we needed to get through this winter. And, in particular, only thanks to United24 alone, hundreds of generators have already been purchased! Among other things, for medical institutions. Dear attendees! Ladies and Gentlemen! Today, I am pleased to announce that we are adding two more areas to the three existing United24 areas that I have already mentioned. For humanitarian demining, we are making a separate area so that as many people as possible can focus on it. And the fifth area for United24 will be education, which is a priority for us today. Accordingly, it is my honor to announce that new ambassadors are joining United24. The first ambassadors of the &quot;Education and Science&quot; area will be scientists and Nobel Prize laureates – Sir Paul Nurse, Mr. Edvard Moser, and Mrs. May-Britt Moser, as well as a Ukrainian woman known to the world will also join it. This is Ms. Ivanna Sakhno. We are very happy to welcome you to our team! Since the Second World War, Europe has not seen such barbaric destruction of the educational network and education in general as Russia is doing now. Unfortunately, hundreds of schools and dozens of universities are in ruins after Russian strikes on them. Non-accidental, targeted strikes. In addition, other educational institutions need to be modernized so that people can work and study remotely when there is a threat of daily terrorist attacks. It is a colossal task but we believe it is realistic. And I have the honor also to announce that Mr. Francis Fukuyama has become the first ambassador for the Demining project. He is not present in the hall, but he is with us. This area is also very important. It is a large-scale one. More than 170,000 square kilometers of the territory of our country are contaminated by mines and unexploded shells. Not all countries in the world have such an entire area that we must make completely safe for our people, for our children. I also want to personally thank all our ambassadors who are here today, who are with us today in Kyiv. And it is important that they are here, despite what happened yesterday. I am glad that you are going through this struggle with us. Together to victory. Mr. Andriy Shevchenko! Our ambassador of the &quot;Medical Aid&quot; area. Andriy, thank you very much from everyone! Mr. Liev Schreiber! Thank you. Our wonderful ambassador of &quot;Medical Aid.&quot; Thank you, Liev! Mr. Oleksandr Usyk! Ambassador of the &quot;Rebuild Ukraine&quot; area. Thank you, Oleksandr! Ms. Katheryn Winnick! Katheryn, thank you. Our beautiful ambassador of the &quot;Rebuild Ukraine&quot; area. Also Mr. Michel Hazanavicius! Our ambassador of the &quot;Rebuild Ukraine&quot; area. Thank you very much, Michel! Representatives of the Imagine Dragons band. Thank you very much. You have been with us since the early days of United24. Thank you, guys, so much for your work and support. Thanks again to the new ambassadors. Thank you, Ms. Ivanna, and thank you, Sir Paul. Thank you very much for being with us. We are together. It is the most important thing. Together we defend our state, our people. Thank you very much to each and every one. And I would like to thank everyone involved in United24. It is a big job, a big result and a big positive. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are doing everything so that the world hears Ukraine, understands and helps our state – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-05</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today, we kept the pace and strength of international work – the whole week gives Ukraine the results it needs. In the morning, after returning from the Netherlands, I held a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bahrain. By the way, it is the first visit of the head of the foreign affairs department of this country during the entire period of our diplomatic relations – since 1992. That is, it is another argument that the world not only believes in Ukraine, but also sees how our state is getting stronger. We talked with the minister about how we can bring peace together for Ukraine and restore peace and stability in international relations. I thanked him for the unwavering support of Ukraine and civilized rules, in particular, the support at the UN platform. We talked about the Ukrainian Peace Formula, and I believe that Bahrain can participate in its implementation. In the afternoon, the United24 state fundraising platform anniversary summit was held. When this platform was launched last May, our main task was to unite ordinary people around the world, to unite for the sake of Ukraine and the defense of freedom. And it succeeded! United24 raised donations from different people, from different companies from 110 countries. We have 15 star ambassadors. I am personally proud of United24&#x27;s support of our work for the naval fleet of drones, and all drone-related projects for the frontline. These are thousands of drones that make Ukraine stronger. A lot has been done within the Medical Aid area of United24, and there are results in the Rebuild Ukraine area. Now, we are adding another educational area – it is the restoration of schools, as well as – demining. It is a big task that Ukraine faces and that can be implemented not in decades, but in years if there is sufficient global support. Not a single Russian mine should remain in our land! In the evening, I held a meeting with a delegation of the Congress of the United States. We talked about further cooperation between our states for the sake of global freedom. Now, when we are fighting side by side with the United States against tyranny, we have reached a level of cooperation that has never been seen between Ukraine and the United States. But it is not the limit. We will continue developing our cooperation – our true alliance. And I thank everyone who helps! Thanks to President Biden for his leadership. I&#x27;m thankful to both parties and houses of Congress for their continued support. Thank you to all Americans whose desire for freedom, together with Ukrainian aspirations, together with all our allies and partners, protects global democracy. Also, today I had a meeting with representatives of the Venice Commission, with representatives of the BlackRock investment fund. So, in a week: the United States and Bahrain, the Netherlands and Belgium, Finland and Sweden, Norway and Denmark, and Iceland. Canada. New Zealand. The African Union and Comoros Islands. And the entire multinational community of United24 donors and partners. We are doing everything to make the world hear Ukraine, understand Ukraine, and help Ukraine. Because by helping us, the world protects itself. I am happy to say that after the meetings in Helsinki and The Hague, we have a powerful reinforcement with weapons for our soldiers – on land, in the air, and at sea. I thank the partners! This is a substantial reinforcement. We have more progress regarding NATO and the European Union. We have made more progress regarding Russia&#x27;s accountability for aggression against our state. Glory to everyone who is now fighting for Ukraine, on combat missions, and at combat posts! I am especially grateful for this week to all the fighters of our Air Force and all units of other detachments defending the sky! Resisting, defeating and punishing the enemy is our common task. In unity, making Ukraine stronger every day, adding new opportunities to our state every day, we will achieve victory! Eternal memory to all our heroes of different times who defended and protected Ukraine! Glory to our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must return and will return all our people from Russian captivity – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-06</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is an important day for our warriors, the Day of the Ukrainian Infantry. It is a professional holiday for defenders that always deserves special attention. The largest component of the Ground Forces, those whose resilience is crucial for defense. Those whose effectiveness is especially important. I had the honor to congratulate our infantrymen today, to present state awards to the warriors and honorary decorations to our brigades for their courage and bravery. The 10th separate mountain assault brigade, the 14th separate mechanized brigade, the 56th separate motorized infantry brigade... Thank you, warriors, for your performance! I thank each and every one of you who has the honor to serve in the Ukrainian infantry! Today I handed over the Order of the Gold Star to the family of our Hero, Captain Valerii Hliebov. He was killed in action. He was the commander of the motorized infantry company of the motorized infantry battalion of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade &quot;Kholodny Yar&quot;. This chevron, the chevron of the Hero of Ukraine, was given to me by his daughter Victoria. I will keep it. It is a great honor for me. Today, our team managed to bring back 45 more of our warriors from Russian captivity. 42 male defenders of Ukraine and 3 female defenders. They all defended Azovstal. National Guardsmen. 35 privates and sergeants, 10 officers. We must return and will return all our people from Russian captivity! I am grateful to our team involved in exchanges. Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Malyuk, Lubinets. Thank you, guys! Today I met with representatives of Utah, one of the strongest states in America. We discussed our cooperation, and this is a good example of how a particular state can help protect freedom and people. Humanitarian support, assistance in reconstruction, political cooperation. We have enough opportunities to work together for the common interests of Ukrainians and Americans. And one more thing. Today, the Prime Minister of Ukraine and the First Lady of Ukraine are representing our country in the United Kingdom, where the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla took place. On behalf of the entire Ukrainian people, I congratulate Their Majesties, true friends of Ukraine, on this historic event that begins a new era of the British monarchy. I wish King Charles III many years of successful reign, and the people of the United Kingdom – prosperity and joint victories with us. It was an honor for me to meet His Majesty in person in London, I remember our conversation, I remember the sincere emotion for Ukraine and Ukrainians. And thank you for your support! Thank you to all the British people! Thank you to each and every one who helps protect life and freedom! Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat! Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>All those who help Ukraine restore security, who put pressure on Russia – all are defenders of peace – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-07</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! This week is coming to an end – a very fruitful one for Ukraine. And these days we are actively preparing for new events in May and June. We should make this time no less fruitful both in the supply of weapons for our soldiers, and in solutions for Ukraine, in negotiations with our partners. An important legislative initiative for our society has been prepared. Sanction decisions against the aggressor are being prepared. We are waiting for international meetings of various levels in Kyiv. We are talking to our partners about weapons that will help us do more to restore peace. This week, many of our partners led in helping Ukraine, helping Ukrainians. From the United States to New Zealand, from the Netherlands and Belgium to Croatia. Northern European countries – Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland. I thank the partners for every decision in support of Ukraine! We are also working out in great detail new steps to help Ukraine with our other partners, we expect them in the near future – exactly what is needed for our strength on the front lines, for the defense of our sky, for justice against terrorists and for the faster restoration of peace for the entire Ukrainian land. I will definitely inform you about those decisions that can be discussed in public. It is very important that the world knows about every fact of Russian terror against our people, that the world talks about what the terrorist state is doing, and how we protect life. I am grateful to everyone who helps us by spreading the truth about Russian strikes and shelling, about the brutality of the occupiers, which does not stop for a day! Endless Russian terror against Nikopol, brutal shelling of the city of Kherson and the region, strikes on the city of Kharkiv and the region, terror against villages in the border areas of Chernihiv region and Sumy region, hell in Donetsk region... Only yesterday, and only in one Russian attack on Kherson region, nine Ukrainians were killed – they were engaged in demining, restoring safety for people. My condolences to the relatives and friends of the deceased. Security is the main goal for Russia. Both in our country and everywhere in Europe, everywhere in the free world. Destroying security, bringing death and chaos is all a terrorist state does. And everyone who helps Ukraine restore security, everyone who strengthens partnerships between countries in Europe for the sake of security, for the sake of common strength, everyone who puts pressure on the terrorist state – all are defenders of peace. I thank everyone in the world who is with Ukraine, who supports our soldiers! Glory to all our soldiers now in battle, at combat posts, and on combat missions! I commend the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade and the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade for the successful destruction of terrorists in Donetsk region! Thank you, warriors! The 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, 93rd Mechanized Brigade. Thanks to all of you, guys, for the heroic defense of the positions, and for exemplary resistance! Good job! There are also results worth noting in the Tavria direction, there are also teams that have something to thank for today. Paratroopers of the 79th Air Assault Brigade and gunners of the 55th Separate Artillery Brigade Zaporizka Sich – thank you, warriors, for your courage and strength! Fighters of the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade and Marines of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade named after Rear-Admiral Mykhailo Ostrohradsky – thank you! Thank you to each of our soldiers, thank you to each of you for every success on the battlefield! Glory to you, Ukrainian heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The address of the President of Ukraine on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in the Second World War of 1939-1945</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-08</span></div>
  <p>Dear people! On May 8, Ukraine and the free world remember six terrible years in the history of mankind. From 1939 to 1945... The years that took the lives of millions of people, including 8 million Ukrainians. The years of occupation and atrocities, bloody battles and bombings, blockades and mass executions, the Holocaust. All the evil that Nazism brought to the world, brought to our land. Different nations opposed evil in unity, as allies of the anti-Hitler coalition. The nations of Europe and America... Asia, Australia, Africa – each has its own history of fighting in that war, but the common history of victory. It is on May 8 that most nations of the world remember the greatness of the victory over the Nazis. The world admires all those who were protecting and protected life. Who threw down the Nazi flags on the liberated territory and who opened the gates of the concentration camps. Who restored freedom to the nations, who destroyed and condemned Nazi evil. It was on May 8, 1945, that the act of unconditional surrender of the Wehrmacht entered into force. It is on May 8 that the world honors the memory of all those, whose lives were taken by that war. It is pure history, without ideological admixtures. And it is the history of our people, our allies, the entire free world. Today, we are returning it to our state. Today, I am submitting a bill to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine proposing that May 8 be the Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in the Second World War of 1939-1945. We will never forget the contribution of the Ukrainian people to the victory over Nazism. And we will not allow anyone to erase the role of Ukrainians in this victory, our people, that generation whose memory we cherish in almost every family. We will not allow the joint victory of the nations of the anti-Hitler coalition to be appropriated and we will not allow lies as if the victory could have taken place without the participation of any country or nation. We destroyed evil together! In the same way as we are now opposing a similar evil together. Remembering the heroism of millions of Ukrainians in that war against Nazism, we see the same heroism in the actions of our soldiers now – the descendants of those who secured the victory – the surrender of Nazism that day, on May 8, 1945. And we are proud of the heroism of the Ukrainian people! Then and now. Unfortunately, evil has returned. Like back then evil rushed to our cities and villages, so it is doing now, like back then it killed our people, so it is doing it now. Although now it is another aggressor, the goal is the same – enslavement or destruction. And like in the Second World War, we are not alone against evil. We fight against it together in the same way – together with the entire free world. With the states and people who created a joint victory at that time. Who, remembering the terrible years of that war, do not say &quot;We can do it again!&quot; but defend the meaning of the words &quot;Never again!&quot; Who did not betray the memory of their heroes and preserve the power of our common values – human life and freedom, equality and dignity, and a world without xenophobia and anti-Semitism, without racism and intolerance, without ideologies of hatred. We fought then and we fight now so that no one ever again enslaves other nations and destroys other countries. And all those old evils that modern Russia is bringing back will be defeated just as Nazism was defeated. This enemy once again put aggression and annexation, occupation and deportation, mass murder, and torture, bombing cities and burning villages up against our ideals. Our victory will be the answer to all this! The victory of Ukraine and the free world. Liberation of our lands. The return of our people. Protecting our values. And inevitably – justice, inevitably – justice against the ruscists&#x27; ideology of hatred. Dear Ukrainians! Now, as 80 years ago, Ukraine is fighting against total evil. Now, just like 80 years ago, Ukraine is fighting for the future – its own and that of the whole of Europe, the whole free world. Now, as 80 years ago, we rely on the common strength of free nations and know that together with them we will always be part of a free Europe that will not submit to evil. And together with all of free Europe, we will celebrate Europe Day on May 9 in Ukraine. A united Europe, the basis of which should be and will be peace. Our Europe, which Ukraine has always been, is, and will be a part of. Today, I signed the relevant decree, and every year from tomorrow, May 9, we will commemorate our historic unity – the unity of all Europeans who destroyed Nazism and will defeat ruscism. This will be the Day of Europe, which has supported Ukrainians for all nine years of aggression and 439 days of the full-scale invasion. This will be the Day of Europe, which helps us fight in all directions: on the battlefield with weapons and on the diplomatic front – with determination, against missile terror and the winter blackout, in the economy and on the legal front. This will be the Day of Europe – our ally. Which gives shelter to Ukrainian women and children. Which does not encroach on our sovereignty and does not call into question our right to choose our own national path. Which never calls Ukraine a &quot;fictional&quot; or &quot;artificial&quot; entity. And which gives us its weapons so that we can defend ourselves and it – our Europe! Many years ago, the tradition of celebrating Europe Day was established on our continent to mark peace and unity achieved. Today, unity on our continent brings us closer to celebrating the first day of our peace. An honest memory of the past always strengthens faith in the future. Today, paying tribute to the most important victory of the 20th century, we are all waiting and approaching a new great day – a new victory. Our victory. Victory Day of Ukraine. Of course, joint. Which we will gain together with everyone who is helping us now. We will remember every state and every nation that joined us in the struggle for freedom. We will never say that the victory could have happened without any of them. It will be a joint success, but I am sure that the world will call this day the same – Victory Day of Ukraine. The day when we expel the last occupier from our land. The day when we liberate all our cities and villages. The day when the curfew throughout Ukraine is replaced by the first minute of peace. When we can forget about the &quot;Air Alarm&quot; application. When the soldiers return to their families, the emigrants return to their homes. When we can safely travel through our country and discover its beauty again and again. When we meet guests of Ukraine, friends of Ukraine at our airports in Boryspil, Simferopol, and our other cities. In the free cities of free Ukraine! We will not lose what we have gained, we will return everything captured by the enemy, we will rebuild what was destroyed and together we will protect it all. We do not yet know the date of our victory but we know that it will be a holiday for all of Ukraine, for all of Europe, for the entire free world. There will be a holiday for all our heroes – our defenders, all our people who fight and work for our victory, all our allies and partners who strive for our victory as much as we do. And our victory will have a symbol – a blue-yellow ribbon, our Ukrainian flag. Wherever it should rightfully be. Wherever our national colors will be also a symbol of respect for our people. It should be like this and will be. We remember the past, fight today, and do not stop, gaining victory. Eternal memory to all those who died in the Second World War! Glory to each and every one who fought against Nazism and won! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to all our heroes of different times, to whom we equally owe our lives! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukrainians&#x27; success in defense against Russian aggression is an antidote to other aggressions – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-08</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, I would like to thank our warriors. Those who defend the Ukrainian sky and those who fight for Ukraine on the frontline. Our defenders of the sky - the Air Force and other branches of troops involved in the defense against terrorists&#x27; missiles and Shaheds - are doing a great job these days! They inspire not only us. Our partners see what Ukrainians are capable of, what the weapons we have been given are capable of in our hands, and how effective we are when we act together for the sake of our common security. Ukrainians&#x27; success in defense against Russian aggression is definitely an antidote to other aggressions. The world needs to see that a free nation is capable of defending freedom from invaders. If we can do it, then others can do it. If they act as boldly, as accurately, and in the same unity with other free nations. I am grateful to each of our warriors who provides Ukraine with this result! I am grateful to every partner who helps our warriors with the weapons they need to be effective! Today I would like to especially celebrate the warriors of the 96th Kyiv air defense missile brigade. For this and the previous day, they have done an absolutely great job! Of course, today, as always, I thank our troops who are fighting in the most fierce areas. Maryinka, Bakhmut, Avdiivka... I thank each and every one who defends Ukraine there for their grit and resilience! The occupiers have again received some new tasks from their leaders to advance somewhere by a certain date... Well, this only means that despite any dates, our heroes will, as always, destroy the occupier. Today, I held a meeting of the Staff. The commanders of operational directions, the Commander-in-Chief and the heads of intelligence delivered reports. By the way, Budanov&#x27;s and Lytvynenko&#x27;s reports were particularly thorough and relevant, and we will take certain steps based on them – steps that will strengthen our defense. There were also reports on the training of our new units and the supply of ammunition. I held a meeting with the Minister for Strategic Industries on ammunition. There is good news in this regard. Of course, now is not the time to make them public. I also held several security meetings with government officials. The head of government, the First Deputy Prime Minister, the Interior Minister, and other ministers. The first meeting concerned demining in Ukraine. As of now, more than 170,000 square kilometers of our territory are contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance. In general, this is estimated in terms of time rather badly – they say it will take decades to deal with such a threat. We have to do it much faster. We are also preparing a special system of actions that will help us demine the new territory faster after de-occupation. We are also actively working with partners to increase our capabilities. In terms of equipment, training of sappers and pyrotechnicians. We will cooperate with everyone in the world who has the experience, who has the technology, who has the financial capacity to support us to make Ukraine clear of Russian mines again. Another security meeting I held today concerned the development of a fundamental new security concept for Ukraine. We will comprehensively answer all security issues of the country. At the legislative level, at the level of government decisions, in specific practical issues. From border protection to new security conditions for schools, from the infrastructural foundations of economic security to a real opportunity to guarantee our people the kind of protection against terror that the most advanced countries in the world have. All this will be presented. All this will be implemented. Today, on May 8, when the world remembers the words &quot;Never again!&quot;, we in Ukraine give meaning to these words. Not only to remember, but also to protect. Not only to value life, but also to do everything to ensure that everyone who threatens life, everyone who brings aggression, everyone who resorts to terror against other nations, every such evil loses. I thank everyone who helps us protect lives! Glory to all our warriors who are now fighting for Ukraine! May the victory over the current evil of ruscism be the best honor to the memory of those who fought and defeated Nazism! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The aggressor&#x27;s accountability for the crime must be inevitable – President&#x27;s speech at the online summit of Core Group leaders on the establishment of the Special Tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-09</span></div>
  <p>Mr. Prosecutor General! Good afternoon, dear colleagues, welcome to this format. Dear Ursula, dear colleagues! Thank you for the opportunity to work for justice and fairness today! Seventy-eight years ago, Europe was given perhaps the most important chance in its long history - a chance for a sustainable and truly lasting peace. What was this chance about? Not only about countries&#x27; renunciation of aggression, not only about political instruments that united Europe - once warring states - to prevent any new steps towards aggression, any new aggression... But also about punishment. Punishment for the aggression that caused the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century - we all understand that this is the Second World War. The main culprit of that catastrophe did not make it to the Tribunal. He carried out an obvious sentence for himself in the bunker. But his accomplices - including the key figures of the aggression - were punished in the legal sphere. They were punished the way humanity punishes any criminals in a civilized manner - through prosecution, trial, sentence and its implementation. And this has served as a strong pillar of peace - a concrete example of how peace violators were punished by the whole world. Civilized punishment! Unfortunately, sixty-eight years after the verdict of the Nuremberg Trials, Europe again felt the blow of aggression... It saw that a regime had emerged that simply does not believe that the world is capable of punishing peace violators. Russia started its aggression against Ukraine in 2014 and made it full-scale in 2022, because the Russian leadership believed that Europe had left history to historians and that the people and politicians of Europe would not dare to really defend their values, would not dare to fight against the new aggression in the way that was necessary to defend themselves. We have to prove that the aggressor was wrong in everything! And not only in his military calculations, not only in the way he assessed our leadership, our state and economic systems. But also in the way he assessed our attitude to justice. Our values are real to us. And we will defend them! This means that we will do everything possible to ensure that the main perpetrator of this aggression and all his accomplices are brought to justice for everything they have done - without exception! First of all, this concerns the crime of aggression. This crime of Russia has brought the 21st century to the brink of global catastrophe as well. This crime calls for justice. And our justice must be swifter than their despair in their bunkers, which is already evident. Our justice must prove international unity in fairness, as it was in Nuremberg. Unfortunately, the International Criminal Court, whose work we fully support, does not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. That is why the Tribunal is needed - to complement the global legal system. I am pleased to announce that our joint group working to punish the aggressor - our Core Group - already includes thirty-seven states. And this number will continue to grow - we are constantly working to make our coalition of defenders of justice bigger. Let me remind you that only four states initially agreed to establish the Nuremberg Tribunal. In total, twenty-four states joined the coalition for the sake of the Tribunal. We are much more numerous now, and not only European countries are among us. Our joint work proves that striving for justice is global. And this summer, the International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Russian Aggression will start its work in The Hague. This will be a practical step in the processing of evidence for the Tribunal. So, we are moving forward, moving step by step. We can discuss what the model of the Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine should be in order to achieve the main goal – justice. We can talk about the order of steps that will lead to the launch of the Tribunal... We are democratic nations after all, so discussions and coordination are normal for us. But once again I emphasize that this must be a Tribunal. I am glad that we have an absolutely clear agreement that the responsibility of the aggressor for the crime must be inevitable. And it is the responsibility of the aggressor for the crime of aggression. On May 9, 1945, after the surrender of Nazi aggression on May 8, the world was already actively moving towards justice for the aggressor. On May 9 this year, our movement is similar - even more active, even more numerous, and I want to thank all of you for that! I am grateful to each and every one of you who is approaching the launch of the Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine! May the chance of our Europe and the world for a sustainable and truly lasting peace without aggression be realized! Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is only a matter of time before we can restore a just peace for our part of Europe, for Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy </h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-09</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have all been able to see that when the state has its honest history returned to it, the sequence of events takes on a special meaning. Yesterday, on May 8, Europe and the world remembered the joint victory over the aggression of Nazism and the surrender of that evil. And today, on May 9, we, along with the entire free Europe, celebrate Europe Day to honor an achievement that simply would not have happened if there had been no victory over Nazism. We would not have had such a united Europe - a Europe without aggression and revanchism, a Europe that respects different cultures, that resolves disputes exclusively in the legal sphere, and that is proud of the diversity on our continent. The more people know the honest history, the more they see the commonalities between the brutal aggressions of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the more they will appreciate this sequence. The Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism in World War II, and immediately after it, the Day of Europe, Europe as a realized dream of a peaceful continent. And it is only a matter of time before we can restore a sustainable and just peace for our part of Europe, for Ukraine. It is only a matter of time before the current aggressor loses, like the aggressor who lost 78 years ago, before Russian revanchism is crushed by the bravery of our warriors and the joint power of the free world. Today we celebrated Europe Day in Ukraine together with Europe. The visit of Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, was both symbolic on this day and very productive. We discussed our defense – what we need to achieve and what we expect from our partners. We discussed sanctions pressure on Russia, and we are actively preparing the 11th sanctions package against Russia together with Europe. We discussed our political prospects for European integration. Of course, we also discussed the export dispute with our neighbors in the EU. We have to overcome it in the clear spirit of the existing treaty framework between us. I am grateful to the President of the European Commission for the participation in today&#x27;s meeting of our partners who are working to establish a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. There are 37 participants in the meeting - states and international institutions. I addressed the participants and urged them to move forward without stopping on the path to full accountability of the aggressor. Today I also met with the communities of European universities - Britain, Sweden, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary and, of course, Ukrainian students. We talked to them about the bravery that Europe will always need and how we can all work together to bring our common victory closer. There is more good news from our partners. From what can be said publicly, there is a new defense package from the United States. The total amount is 1 billion 200 million dollars. Artillery, protection against terrorist missiles and drones, and other things to strengthen our defenders. I thank President Biden, the Congress - both parties - and every American family for their unwavering support and for the American strength that makes us stronger. We are also working with other partners on additional defense packages to add new opportunities for our warriors. Special thanks to the French parliament for today&#x27;s decision to recognize the Russian pseudo-private Wagner group as a terrorist organization. This is something that should be adopted by the entire world - every manifestation of terrorism must be destroyed, and every terrorist must be convicted. And, of course, today, after the terrorist state has once again tried to torture our people and lost to our defenders of the sky once again, I thank our Air Force and all our warriors of other branches of troops who ensure air defense. Truly well done! Glory to all who defend Ukraine and Ukrainians! Thank you to everyone who helps! Thank you to everyone who, together with us, returns peace and justice to Europe! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is in Ukraine that the world will see what Europe is capable of - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-10</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Briefly about this day, about our actions. Our international block is working vigorously and thoroughly with partners on new defense packages for Ukraine. New decisions are already at the working level. More protection for our skies, more opportunities for our defense and movement on the ground. I held several meetings today where we discussed all this. And we expect appropriate steps from our partners in the near future. Let us not forget for a single minute that every day of the occupier’s presence on our land is a temptation for him to think that he will succeed. He will not! We must return freedom, security and Europe to all Ukrainian land - to all European land. We will do it! We will not leave a single piece of our land to the enemy - tyranny will not reign anywhere. And I thank our partners-leaders, all partner countries, each and every one who helps us increase our strength and make Ukrainian defense even more active. Today, I held a very informative meeting with government officials on programs to restore our territory and Ukrainian life after hostilities and the war in general. We are working on all aspects of recovery, and each of them is in a new security format. Economy and industry, defense industry, energy, infrastructure, education, social sphere, healthcare sector, including the rehabilitation component... All that needs to be built, what the world is ready to invest in, what will give Ukraine and Ukrainians reliable protection and steady development of our social capital. Now, in May, we will finalize the specific points of these state programs, and in June we will start practical work with our partners on our plans, including both the reconstruction of critical systems here and now and the strategic transformation of our country. I am confident that our reconstruction project will give impetus to the development of at least our entire region – following Ukraine and all our partners who will cooperate with Ukraine. It is here, in Ukraine, that the world will see what Europe is capable of. Here, in Ukraine, we will have the maximum of Europe in Europe - the maximum possible of what European values are capable of, what European and global cooperation is capable of. Step by step, based on the resources we have now, we are implementing programs for the ongoing recovery of our country. In particular, today &quot;eVidnovlennia&quot; public service has been launched. It is aimed to support people who need to repair their homes or apartments after war damage. Already today we have received a significant number of applications in Diia. In total, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of damaged objects. Moreover, we have to fulfill this task also for those of our people who were able to restore their damaged housing on their own. Equality in assistance is very important, and we need an appropriate algorithm. The next step is compensation for lost housing. It will also be implemented. Of course, today I communicated with our commanders and intelligence chiefs. The situation on the frontline is an obvious first priority. Today, I also signed new decrees on presenting our warriors with state awards. The 10th separate mountain assault brigade. The 14th, 28th, 53rd, 59th and 72nd separate mechanized brigades. The 3rd separate assault brigade. The 27th rocket artillery brigade. The 112th separate territorial defense brigade. The 67th separate infantry battalion. The 65th military mobile hospital. These are the Lyman direction, Bakhmut, Chasiv Yar, Avdiivka direction, Shakhtarsk direction. In total, today&#x27;s decrees honor 266 of our defenders. The bravest, the most worthy – those whose lives are the life of Ukraine, our beautiful and unbreakable Ukraine. Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat, at combat posts and on combat missions! Glory to every Ukrainian family that has raised such sons and daughters! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today, I approved a comprehensive strategic plan for reforming our law enforcement system – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-11</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I have an honorable and very pleasant task for this address – I have the honor to thank our warriors and units who have distinguished themselves in the defense of the state since the beginning of this week. Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops – the 3rd and 5th separate assault brigades and the 28th separate mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign... I thank all of you guys - every soldier, sergeant and officer - for the extremely successful actions on destroying the occupiers. A very good result! Tavria operational and strategic group of troops – the warriors of the 44th separate artillery brigade named after Hetman Danylo Apostol, Zaporizhzhia Sich 55th separate artillery brigade, our glorious &quot;Fifty-niners&quot; - the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Yakiv Handziuk and the 79th separate airborne assault troops brigade - I thank you all for your firmness in positions, for your strength in battles, for the inspiration to win that you give to the whole of Ukraine with your precision and courage. Odesa operational and strategic group of troops – thanks to the warriors of the 406th separate artillery brigade named after Brigadier General Oleksiy Almazov for their excellent results in destroying enemy concentration points! Today I would also like to celebrate the artillery crews of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade – the guys know how to &quot;subtract&quot; the enemy equipment on the battlefield. Each of your accurate strikes, our heroes, means saved lives of Ukrainians. Thank you! This week, the units of our National Guard also deserve to be recognized. In particular, the warriors of the 1st and 14th operational brigades of the National Guard, who, together with all the defense and security forces of Ukraine, are defending our country in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. I thank you, national guardsmen, for your resilience and for your ability to push the former &quot;second army of the world&quot; lower and lower in the list of military forces with the help of your intelligence and artillery. Today, I also signed a new decree on honoring our warriors with state awards. These are exemplary brave servicemen of our Airborne Assault Troops. 134 warriors... The 25th separate airborne Sicheslav brigade, the 46th separate airmobile brigade, the 95th separate air assault brigade, the 132nd separate reconnaissance battalion, the 148th separate artillery division and the 199th training center of the Airborne Assault Troops. Each of these titles, each of these units is an honor, a pride of Ukraine, a heroism of our people. The heroism that makes Ukraine free forever. By standing up now, by liberating our land now, by giving Ukraine victories now, each and every one of those who fights for Ukraine gives freedom to all new generations of our people. Foreign flags will never reign on our land, and our people will never be enslaved. The resilience in the battles now, the power in our active actions, the bravery and precision of our warriors every day and every night is the independence of Ukraine that will be permanent. Independence we are strengthening and will continue to do so. Today, as always, I was in touch with the commanders and intelligence. I held several meetings on our international efforts. Soon I will be able to announce very important news for our defense, for our relations with partners. I had a meeting with the Special Advisor to the President of Brazil on Foreign Policy. We discussed the possibility of holding a summit in the Ukraine – Latin America format. I reiterated my invitation for the President of Brazil to visit our country and see with his own eyes the heroism of Ukrainians, our real commitment to peace for the entire Ukrainian land, for all our cities and communities that are now under attack by Russian terrorists. Our Peace Formula, which Ukraine offered to the world last year, has only become more relevant today. This is the only comprehensive and realistic plan to restore peace not only to our people, but also to all the peoples of the world who strive for life without aggression. And one more thing. Today, I approved a comprehensive strategic plan for reforming our law enforcement system - all law enforcement agencies and the prosecutor&#x27;s office. This is a detailed document designed until 2027. To put it simply, we have to provide a system of guaranteeing justice and law and order for our country that will also meet our goal of Ukraine&#x27;s rapid accession to the EU - we add our readiness to realize this goal, and, no less importantly, we guarantee the foundations of a new social contract that are obviously being outlined now in the defense of our state. Every element of the state system – law enforcement agencies, first and foremost – must work in such a way that people really feel safe and secure, that people really feel justice, that it is guaranteed at the level of institutions by the daily work of those by whom people judge the state. Trust within the state and trust in the state are built on trust in those who act on behalf of the state. Law enforcement and the prosecution system are key to this. Of course, along with everyone else who works in the state apparatus. Ukraine should become and has already become a place of strength for Europe and the entire free world. We have to ensure maximum security, maximum freedom, maximum respect for the law and for people in Ukraine. And this is the answer to the question of what kind of Ukraine we are building after the war. A state that respects its people and is respected in the world. A state whose example of life is respected by everyone. The path to this begins now. It begins in the actions and personal decisions of each and every person who fights and works for Ukraine and for all Ukrainians. Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat! Glory to our beautiful people! Thank you to everyone in the world who helps us, Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Attempts to circumvent sanctions should be defined as one of the gravest crimes against international law and peace – address of Ukraine&#x27;s President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-12</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today is a sanction day. Five sanctions packages have been approved, which we prepared very carefully these weeks in the NSDC, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Office, and our secret services. The first is a package related to Zaporizhstal. We block the influence of the terrorist state on this company, which existed thanks to various front and offshore persons. The shares controlled by Russia through one of the systemic banks will be confiscated and will work for the sake of Ukraine and Ukrainians. We won&#x27;t leave any link of the terrorist state in Ukraine that it can use against our state, against our economy or against our people. In addition, sanctions packages have been approved that continue our course to isolate and block the Russian defense industry. Hundreds of individuals and legal entities of the terrorist state and those connected with Russia are becoming targets for global isolation. We are working very actively with our partners so that all those who actually produce this aggression, who give weapons, ammunition, equipment and technologies into the hands of terrorists – so that they are all crushed by the world. I&#x27;m thankful to everyone who helps Ukraine put pressure on Russia for this war, as well as block the terrorist state&#x27;s attempts to circumvent sanctions. I am sure this should be defined as one of the gravest crimes against international law and international peace – trying to circumvent sanctions introduced to limit the resources of aggression, or assisting in these efforts. I held a meeting of Staff of Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. There were important reports by the commanders of task forces. I will especially note a report of General Syrsky and General Tarnavsky, commanders of the Khortytsia and Tavria air defense units, respectively. There was a report by Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, Minister of Defense Reznikov, and Minister for Strategic Industries Kamyshin. What is important to understand now? The occupiers are already internally ready for defeat. They have already lost this war in their minds. We must put pressure on them daily so that their sense of defeat turns into their escape, their mistakes, their losses. I thank each and every one who destroys the enemy! I&#x27;m thankful to everyone who, despite any difficulties, returns our land to Ukraine! We are preparing to add even more weapons for you, warriors, to have even more opportunities to defeat the aggressor and restore peace. I spoke today with British Prime Minister Sunak. Thank you, Rishi, for your continued support and the steps which make it clear to the world that the UK will always lead the way. We discussed our current weapons cooperation, our next defense cooperation, and the diplomatic steps we must take together to bring our shared victory closer. To guarantee: whoever is the aggressor against the free world, he will end up with the same disgrace as the Kremlin. Glory to all our soldiers currently in battle, at combat posts and on combat missions! I thank everyone who trains our fighters! I thank everyone who treats and restores Ukrainian soldiers after injuries! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today in Rome, we agreed on weapons and anti-aircraft defense – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-13</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today in Rome. As always with such visits, we have a result. Today, we have become stronger. I met with the President of Italy and the President of the Council of Ministers – these are political-level meetings. I&#x27;ve heard that Italy will continue supporting Ukraine – as much as it is necessary for us to stand up and defend our people and our territory. We agree with Giorgia, Madam Prime Minister, on our new joint defense steps. There are good things we can do together to protect the sky. There are good things we can do together to protect the land. We agreed on weapons and air defense. As Giorgia correctly said, when we in Ukraine defend freedom and our lives from Russian bombs and missiles, from terror, we keep away war from the rest of Europe. Today, Russian killers took the life of another Ukrainian child – a girl, who has not yet turned 16. Her name was Nadia... A man also died, he was 64 years old. Just ordinary people from the ordinary town of Kostiantynivka in Donbas... My condolences to their relatives and friends! It was a Russian rocket artillery strike. Simply on the streets – houses, shops, a pharmacy, and a warehouse. It is how Russia fights. Artillery against ordinary streets, against any people – children or adults, men or women. And this can be stopped only with powerful weapons, with which our soldiers can expel the evil of aggression. Expel so that the Kremlin could not spread aggression to other European nations. Today, I had the honor to personally thank Rome, all of Italy, Ms. Meloni, and everyone in the Italian political class who is honestly responding to the current threat to our entire European way of life. I met with Pope Francis, and it was a conversation that could really influence history, could really help stop the evil of aggression. I told about the crimes committed by the Russian occupiers against our people, about the deportation of Ukrainian children. It is not even known exactly how many children Russia has stolen from Ukraine and is hiding from their relatives, from Ukraine somewhere in a foreign land. I asked His Holiness to help return our children home to Ukraine. I also spoke about other points of our Peace Formula, besides the return of all deportees and prisoners. And I believe that the will and sincerity of His Holiness can bring the implementation of our Peace Formula closer, can bring a fair, honest peace closer. In the evening, from here, from Rome, I spoke with the President of the South African Republic. I spoke about the Peace Formula, about justice, and about the fact that our world should be united by the rules of international law. Anyone who helps the aggressor with a weapon will be an accomplice with all the consequences. I called on Mr. President to join together with other countries, all continents, and Africa the joint work to implement our Peace Formula. By the way, Italy today absolutely clearly supported all points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula. I thank you for that. Today, there is also a Joint Declaration with Italy. All the important things: the European Union – Italy supported the start of negotiations in 2023, correct and timely signals about NATO. And one more. I am especially grateful to all those people who were on the streets of Rome with our Ukrainian flags, who met the Ukrainian delegation with an open heart and sincere good emotions... Italy should always be on the side of good so that good remains in Europe! Viva Italia! Glory to our soldiers! Thank you to our Air Force and all air defense fighters of other types of army units! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The main results of these days – our victory has been brought closer – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-15</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Three long days – and our warriors and our state are getting stronger. Much stronger, I am sure of it. We are returning home with new defense packages: more new and powerful weapons for the frontline, more protection for our people. More political support. Italy - good talks with Giorgia, Madam Prime Minister. Meeting with the Pope, quite encouraging. Meeting with the President of Italy. Germany - Mr. President Steinmeier, meeting with Mr. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which was particularly meaningful for our defense. In addition to Berlin, we also visited Aachen. I visited a military base, inspected Leopards, Marders, and thanked our soldiers who are training on German equipment. On behalf of the Ukrainian people and in honor of the Ukrainian people, we received a significant European award named after Charlemagne in Aachen. It was the first time that the Ukrainian language was spoken in the hall where the laureates are honored. Ukrainian will be one of the official languages of the European Union, I am sure of it. France - a meeting with President Macron, long, useful talks. There is a new military package. It is powerful. There are new political agreements. Great Britain - meeting with Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister Sunak. Defense and very important British leadership in military coalitions. We coordinated our positions before the international events scheduled for the near future: before the G7, the summit in Vilnius. Our Peace Formula was discussed at all the meetings, and now there is more willingness of our partners to follow the Ukrainian formula. There is more support for our accession to the EU, more understanding that Ukraine&#x27;s accession to NATO will happen, it is inevitable. I thank Italy for its help in protecting the lives of our people - from protecting the sky to preparing for the full reconstruction of Ukraine after hostilities. I am grateful to Germany for the largest defense package - 2 billion 700 million euros. IRIS-T air defense systems of various modifications, a lot of missiles for them, guns, shells, armored vehicles... In addition, Germany will support our country in the long term, with 11 billion euros for defense. Germany also participates in the European Peace Facility, which strengthens our defense. I thank France for the new opportunities for our soldiers in countering Russian terror, and now is not the time to talk about the details. Thank you for additional equipment, for additional armored vehicles. I thank you for your help in consolidating our partners. I am grateful to the UK for agreeing to train our pilots. We are creating a coalition to train pilots on modern Western aircraft. The UK agreed, Poland agreed, and I&#x27;m sure France and other partners will join. We continue our work on the fighter jet coalition as well, and we are moving forward actively. Of course, I am grateful to the UK for the long-range capabilities for our warriors. So, the main results of these days are new weapons for Ukraine, respect for Ukrainians, and our victory has been brought closer. And we will add more support! I know it. I believe in it. Glory to all those who are in combat for our country! Glory to everyone who helps! Glory to all who train our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Together with Ukraine&#x27;s partners, we will make the defense against terror as strong as possible – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-16</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, I want to thank all the defenders of our skies. Thank you, heroes! Eighteen of the eighteen missiles were shot down. That&#x27;s why we are constantly working on visits that will bring more opportunities, more Patriot, IRIS-T, Crotale, Hawk, NASAMS systems. Again and again, I thank all our partners in the world who have helped our country with the appropriate air defense systems! Yesterday, we also agreed in Britain with Rishi, with Mr. Prime Minister, that we would work on a coalition of fighter jets – training, aircraft, results. Yesterday, this was also supported by French President Macron, and today it was supported by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. A good start for the coalition! Thank you all! However, it is important to say one more thing. We also have to remember how much effort it takes to get such weapons for Ukraine. How much time, energy, arguments, meetings and information work allowed us to build such an air defense system. This is a tremendous job... And I thank each and every one who is involved! At all levels! Day after day, month after month, our team has been working to ensure that we have protection of the sky. We used to hear that Patriots were supposedly unrealistic... And now here they are, Patriots. And that’s not all we will provide for Ukraine! Together with Ukraine&#x27;s partners, we will make the defense against terror as strong as possible. This morning, the first thing I did after returning from my foreign visits was holding a meeting of the Staff. There were reports from the commanders of operational directions, the Commander-in-Chief, government officials responsible for defense and intelligence. General Syrskyi&#x27;s report on the situation in the Bakhmut sector was very important. I thank all our warriors there, every soldier, sergeant and officer who are doing superhuman things in this area. Well done to all of them! And I would like to especially mention the 5th separate assault brigade, the paratroopers of the &quot;Eightieth&quot; and the warriors of the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade... Your courage, your determination and your success in destroying the enemy is extremely important! Thank you! Tavria direction... &quot;Seventy-ninth&quot; - the glorious 79th separate air assault brigade, artillerymen of the 55th separate artillery brigade, 74th separate reconnaissance battalion, 116th separate territorial defense brigade, 128th separate mountain assault Zakarpattia brigade... Thank you! Your steadfastness and precision are exemplary. I took part online in the Council of Europe Summit in Reykjavik today. All the countries of free Europe, the strong leaders of our Europe... I thanked them for their support of our country and urged them to continue to work together one hundred percent so that we are protected - all of Ukraine, all of Europe, the entire free world - one hundred percent. No terrorist missile, no terrorist cannon and no terrorist blackmail should threaten freedom! I held several meetings today on international events - we are doing everything to give our warriors even more opportunities to make the end of this war with our victory even closer. We are preparing more news for Ukraine! Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are Europeans, so we act at one hundred percent of our strength when it comes to protecting our way of life – speech by the President of Ukraine at the opening of the Fourth Summit of the Council of Europe</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-16</span></div>
  <p>Thank you so much! Prime Minister Jakobsdóttir, dear Katrin, thank you for invitation to participate in the Summit of our Council of Europe and for your sincere desire to help Ukraine. Dear leaders of Europe! Today, Ukraine went through a difficult challenge – an intense Russian missile attack. Such challenges are what we all have to pay attention to now. At three o&#x27;clock in the morning, our people woke up to explosions... Eighteen Russian missiles of different types were in our sky – in particular, ballistic ones, which the terrorist state has boasted about. We were told such missiles would bring a guaranteed death, because they are supposedly impossible to shoot down. Russia used ballistics, cruise missiles, drones at the same time – to make it especially difficult for our air defence to save lives. But all lives were protected – all missiles were shot down, including ballistic ones. One hundred percent! This is a historical result. Thank you all! Russia is trying very hard to improve its ability to kill. We are trying very hard to improve the protection of our people. And I thank all the countries and leaders who help us to improve our air defence! All together we are showing what our one hundred percent mean, and what the power of the free world means. And of course I thank every our soldier who makes this job done – in our skies and on our land, and especially I thank each and every one who trains our warriors in different train missions which are all similar in one point – in success. Thanks to all of them! Thanks to all of you! A year ago, we were not able to shoot down most of the terrorists&#x27; missiles, especially ballistic ones. And I am asking one thing now: if we’re able to do this, is there anything we can&#x27;t do when we’re united and determined to protect lives? The answer is that we, in unity, will give one hundred percent in any field – when we have a goal to protect our people and our Europe. Of course, there is still much to be done. Ukraine&#x27;s territory is big, and to make air defence results like last night&#x27;s the rule throughout the country, we need additional air defence systems and missiles. We also need modern fighter jets, without which no air defence system will be perfect. And I am sure we will get there. One hundred percent should be our benchmark. We must leave zero percent to the aggressor! One hundred percent of success of defence operations is guaranteed by weapons and training of our soldiers. I thank everyone who strengthens our defense! One hundred percent of success of sanctions is guaranteed by honesty in every state policy. I am grateful to all those who treat the fight against terror in this way – honestly! One hundred percent of success of our Peace Formula is guaranteed by diplomacy. I thank everyone who helps us unite the world to implement the Peace Formula, the only realistic peace plan! And of course one hundred percent of justice, as there will be no reliable peace without justice. I thank the Council of Europe – each and every of you personally! – for the decision on the Register of Damages caused by Russia&#x27;s aggression. This brings closer the creation of a full-fledged Compensation Mechanism that will show the world that aggression is not worth even thinking about. There should also be a Special Tribunal for the crime of aggression – so that those, whose heads this terror was born in, are brought to responsibility. I am sure that we will provide this result for one hundred percent. Europe has been waiting for such times – times when leaders would act in one hundred percent unity and with one hundred percent results for the sake of protecting Europe, for the sake of our common values. And finally this is what we are achieving now! Ukraine, all of Europe, and everyone who is currently at this Summit and who helps us. We are Europeans, so we are free. We are Europeans, so we value peace. We are Europeans, so we act at one hundred percent of our strength when it comes to protecting our way of life. Let these be forever the rules of our continent! Thank you for support! Cлава Україні! Glory to all Europe!</p>

  <h2>We need more consolidation of the world to put pressure on Russia, more strength for our warriors - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today, the Russian shelling of our Kherson region claimed the life of another child. A boy. His name was Vsevolod. He would have turned six years old in July. My condolences to the family and friends! It was another artillery attack by terrorists. People were just on the street near an ordinary store. Regular shelling of Sumy, Chernihiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia regions and Donbas proves again and again that we need even more consolidation of the world to put pressure on Russia, even more strength for our warriors to destroy every position of terrorists, and even more support for our people to save lives and return security to our cities and villages. Today I held several preparatory meetings on new steps to strengthen our defense and our international positions. A Ukrainian delegation visited the Republic of Korea, and it was a pretty successful visit. Government officials, the First Lady of Ukraine. There were meetings, negotiations at various levels, and Olena&#x27;s address to the people of Korea and all the nations of the region at the important Asian Leadership Forum. I thank Mr. President of the Republic of Korea for his clear condemnation of Russian aggression and support of global efforts for peace. There is an important decision of the Council of Europe: the final resolution of the summit held in Iceland supports the Ukrainian Peace Formula. It is important that Europe is so united for the sake of a fair peace plan. I thank all the leaders of our Europe and every member state of the Council of Europe for this. Based on this consolidation, we will continue to limit the ability of the terrorist state to continue this aggression and will further increase our ability to bring justice, liberate our land, and save our people. I would like to thank the parliamentarians of the two European countries. Today, the French Senate voted to recognize the Holodomor of 1932-33 as genocide of the Ukrainian people. I am grateful to everyone who supported this decision. Strengthening historical truth is the mission of the strong. The Estonian Parliament has adopted a statement in support of our aspiration to become a full member of NATO and called on the Alliance to support this decision. I thank all the Estonian people and the entire Estonian political class for such clear support for our common Euro-Atlantic security. Thank you to everyone who helps us protect our people, our Ukraine and life in general! Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat, on combat missions and at combat posts! Glory to each and every one who is now in the epicenter of the fighting in the east of our country and is making extraordinary efforts to prevent the enemy from advancing. I thank you, warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Without an international tribunal, without bringing to justice all Russian war criminals, evil will return very soon - Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the participants of the second PISM Strategic Ark conference</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-18</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! At any moment, the recording of this address could be interrupted by an air raid siren. This one sentence concisely and aptly describes the state of global security and the level of threats it faces today. I welcome all participants of the second Strategic Ark and the important dialogue on world security. The decisive battle for its future has been ongoing for 449 days. Today is a special day. This forum is taking place on a significant date - May 18. A day on which history has left us with many clues and lessons. Warnings and mistakes that we have no right to repeat on the path to our global security. It is May 18, 1792, when a Russian army of a hundred thousand troops crossed the borders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and invaded its land. The Russian-Polish war began, the consequences of which we all remember. Today, it is the same enemy. The same goal. The same price of defeat. We have no right to lose. We have no right to weaken our resistance and opposition for a moment, we have no right not to finish off the evil, to lose the unity of our allies, to lay down our arms prematurely, not to fight to the ultimate victory. We have no right to be misled when Russia starts actively talking about peace and diplomacy. Russia is concerned not about the end of bloodshed, but about the end of money and resources to continue it. Russia needs time, not peace. For new missiles, a new plan, a new attack. This is the formula of Russian politics. It has been unchanged for centuries. The twenty-first century should be its last. The Ukrainian Peace Formula contains the mechanisms to realize this. Security guarantees to ensure that this never happens again. So that May 18, 1944 does not happen again. The genocide of the Crimean Tatar people. The forced deportation and loss of their home for decades. All that modern Russia, calling itself the successors and followers of the totalitarian regime, repeated in Crimea in 2014. And repeated eight years later in Donbas, in Mariupol, in Kherson. Unpunished evil always returns. Without an international tribunal and bringing all Russian war criminals to justice, it will return very soon. We have often heard the words &quot;destruction of the international security architecture&quot;. On February 24, they turned into clear visual forms. Destroyed houses in Bucha, Borodyanka, Uman, Hostomel, and Mariupol - this is what security architecture looks like today. Kinzhal missiles are hitting it every day. We need a protected sky. We thank everyone who is involved in this process and in the formation of the air coalition. We will definitely see Fighting Falcons in the Ukrainian skies. For our ancestors, the falcon has long been a heaven-blessed synthesis of intelligence, courage, youth, and strength. Light. And victory. A hundred years ago, &quot;Hej, Sokoly!&quot; song led Ukrainians and Poles into a joint battle. For our freedom and yours. Today our ranks are much larger. And just like a hundred years ago, we will see the parade on Khreshchatyk again. To our victory and yours! Of Ukraine. Europe. The world. Humanity. Finally, I want to mention another May 18. Last year. The day when NATO received applications for accession of two new members. The speed with which Finland has come this way and the high prospects of Sweden give Ukraine confidence and faith in the NATO Summit in Vilnius. In the Alliance&#x27;s determination and will to reaffirm its choice in favor of the values of freedom and indivisible security. In the fact that in July we will see a new important stage on Ukraine&#x27;s path to NATO membership. On the path to a common and secure future. Of Ukraine. Europe. The world. Humanity.</p>

  <h2>Our priorities for the near future are additional air defense systems, missiles, training and aircraft, long-range weapons – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-18</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I have just held a meeting of the military cabinet. This is our special format of working in a narrow circle with those responsible for the defense of the state. There were commanders of key frontline areas. Also the Commander-in-Chief, the General Staff, intelligence, security. A truly meaningful work. First of all, the defense brigades did a good job, they fulfilled the main strategic tasks, but now is not the time to give details. Secondly, the offensive brigades are doing a good job, we are preparing, no details. Thirdly, on the protection of civilians, the Air Force is doing a great job, here with details. Our priorities for this week, next week, and for the near future are additional air defense systems, additional missiles, training and aircraft, and long-range weapons. And this will be fulfilled. Today I also held a thorough meeting with our international staff - the Office&#x27;s team. We have a task to maintain the momentum of international support and communication for Ukraine, which was achieved in the first half of May, in these weeks as well. I am confident that we will accomplish this task. I had the honor to visit the office of the Crimea Platform and meet with the leader of the Crimean Tatar people Mustafa Dzhemilev, representatives of the Mejlis and the Crimean Tatar community. Today and every year on this day, May 18, we honor the memory of all the victims of the deportation of the Crimean Tatar people. It was one of the most serious crimes of the twentieth century - the entire nation was forcibly removed from its native land and forced to live in a foreign land for decades. And when the people returned home, Russia once again brought its evil to their home, to our Ukraine - the evil of aggression, repression, and humiliation. It is our historical task to restore justice to all our people, to guarantee freedom for our entire country without any exceptions. The task of all those who defend the state, all those who chose Ukraine and, therefore, will win. I am glad to see that the Crimea Platform we have created effectively channels the joint power of our entire state and the Crimean Tatar people. I am glad to know that our joint work with the Mejlis brings the result Ukraine needs. By the way, we are preparing some very important joint steps for the near future. We are bringing the issue of Crimea, Crimean prisoners and all our people in Crimea to a new international level. And one more thing. Today, many Ukrainians wore vyshyvankas. It&#x27;s important to remember the richness that unites us all. Ukraine is diverse, and this is our strength, and it was evident throughout the day in the different patterns of embroidery. But now I ask you all to remember those Ukrainians who are literally our strength and our defense. Many of our people were not wearing vyshyvankas because they were in military uniforms. I ask you now to remember everyone who is fighting for Ukraine. All those who are on combat missions and at combat posts for the sake of Ukraine. All those who train our soldiers for the sake of Ukraine. Those whom you know personally, those whom you have heard about, and thousands and thousands of others who are equally protecting the life of Ukraine. Please remember them now and thank them. We also do not forget for a single moment about those of our people who are held captive by the occupier. About captured Ukrainians, about those repressed in the occupied territories. About those who are in the occupied cities and communities and are waiting for the return of our flag and our state. We must liberate all our people and all our land from Russian captivity. Let us act together, in unity, taking care of each other and the state, and let us not stop until we win. Thank you to everyone who helps! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Eternal memory to all victims of Russian tyranny! Eternal memory to all victims of the deportation of the Crimean Tatar people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I call on you to help protect our people including the Ukrainian Muslim community - address by the President of Ukraine at the Arab League Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-19</span></div>
  <p>First, I express my gratitude for the warm hospitality to His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed, to the entire people of Saudi Arabia and the city of Jeddah which is hosting this Summit. I hope that most of us are here for the sake of peace and justice. Dear participants of the Summit! Today is the four hundred and fiftieth day of the full-scale war waged against us by Russian invaders. We do not have missiles as our enemy has. We have less air power. We do not possess numerous killer drones that Iran supplies to Russia. We do not have that much artillery. But, we do stay strong, because we do have truth on our side. Moreover, we are pushing the occupiers out of our land. Anyone who defends his native land from invaders and anyone who defends children of his nation from enslavement, – every such warrior is on the path of justice. And I am proud to represent such warriors and the entire Ukrainian people! Ukrainians have never chosen the war. Our troops did not go to other lands, we do not engage in annexations and plunder of other nations&#x27; resources. But we will never submit to any foreigners or colonizers. That&#x27;s why we fight! And I&#x27;m sure, all your nations will understand this main emotion of ours. I’m also sure, all your nations will understand the main call I want to leave here in Jeddah, a noble call to all of you – to help protect our people including the Ukrainian Muslim community! With me here is the honorable Mustafa Dzhemilev, the leader of the Crimean Tatar people – one of the indigenous peoples of Ukraine, whose home is Crimea, the center of Muslim culture in Ukraine. For centuries, the Crimean Tatars have been and should remain an integral and strong part of the Muslim community of the world. But Crimea was the first to suffer from the Russian occupation, and until now, most of those who are subjected to repression in the occupied Crimea are Muslims. We already have a positive experience with Saudi Arabia regarding the release of our people captured by Russia. We can expand this experience! And even if there are people here at the Summit who have a different view on the war on our land calling it a conflict, I am sure that we can all be united in saving people from the cages of Russian prisons. Unfortunately, there are some in the world and here, among you, who turn a blind eye to those cages and illegal annexations. I am here so that everyone can take an honest look. No matter how hard the Russians try to influence, there must still be independence. And I want to thank Saudi Arabia, I want to thank the majority of you for supporting firm international positions and the UN Charter. Dear participants of the Summit! Your people have already seen that Ukrainians are a people of peace. Real peace. In 2021, we made a priority Ukraine&#x27;s openness to your people, and the people of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, and Kuwait got to know Ukraine. I&#x27;m happy that your tourists were able to see the splendor of spring in our capital, Kyiv, and the majesty of the Carpathian mountains! I believe that one day your people will come back also to see our Crimea free from Russian occupation and humiliation. Our relations are also tied by the education of tens of thousands of Arab students in our universities every year. It really is an honor for us that children from Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Algeria, Libya and Tunisia went to Ukraine for education. With you, we fullfilled one of the most honorable tasks in the world – food security. Ukraine traditionally supplies your countries with wheat and other agricultural products. We were glad to welcome the investments of the Arab nations, as well as the investments of Qatar in the port infrastructure. First, the pandemic, and then a more terrible virus, the rabies of aggression, hit these and our other normal relationships. I am more than sure that none of you will agree to surrender a third of your country to the invaders. I am more than sure none of you would watch without a fight how foreigners steal the children of your people; hundreds of thousands of our children are deported to Russia, separated from their relatives, and there in Russia they’re trying to teach our children to hate their natives. I&#x27;m more than sure that none of you would admit the military occupation of a nuclear plant to use it to blackmail the world with nuke disaster. Look at how much suffering the long-term wars have brought to Libya, Syria, Yemen... How many lives have been wasted by years of fighting in Sudan and Somalia, in Iraq and Afghanistan… Everyone who adds to suffering by his new aggressions, everyone who sows enmity, everyone who wants to bring back the old days of invading empires that did not count with the will of independent nations – every aggressor goes against the world and will be cursed by the people. And I greet everyone who is ready to join us on the path of justice! Ukraine proposed the Peace Formula to end the war. You can see how it works on the example of food security, one of the points of our Formula. Even when the war is thrown into our home, we do everything so that the homes of other peoples also survive. We managed to launch the Black Sea Grain Initiative and partially lift the Russian naval blockade of our ports. This stabilized food markets and helped many, including the nations of the Arab League. The implementation of another point of our Peace Formula will also help many – the return home of all captives and deportees. Each of the honorable delegations was given a document in your language – with ten points of the Peace Formula. Please, you can choose the point to help that you consider appropriate. And I will be grateful to each of you who will choose exactly the direction of rescuing people held in Russian captivity. So, I invite all of you who respect peace to join the implementation of the Peace Formula and, thus, to reduce enmity and wars, suffering and evil. Russia is weak – we beat it even when it has more weapons in its hands; its aggressiveness does not come from strength, but from the understanding that the time of empires has passed. That’s because the time of free independent nations will never end, and Ukraine proves it. I wish you peace! I invite you to cooperate directly with our country without any intermediaries. And may our and your strength act in a coordinated manner for the peace and good of people of all nations! And please, listen to the Crimean Tatar people, listen to the Muslims of Ukraine! May the Almighty protect our soldiers! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>We attract as many countries and leaders as possible for the sake of Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-20</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today is the first day of meetings and negotiations in Japan on the eve of the G7 summit. We coordinate positions with partners, prepare new joint steps. Defense: weapons, air defense, fighter jets. We attract as many countries and leaders as possible for the sake of Ukraine. Peace Formula. Long-term support programs for Ukraine. Finance and economy. I met with Giorgia Meloni, head of the Italian government. We saw how our agreements from the negotiations in Rome are being implemented. I told Giorgia about the agreements at the Arab League summit. We looked at how we can now enhance with Italy our capabilities to protect life from Russian air terror. Talks with Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. We discussed our bilateral relations, our defense. I thanked him for the leadership in developing our capabilities in the sky – the United Kingdom very actively tackles the issue of modern fighter jets for Ukraine, and these are historical things. I spoke with the Prime Minister of India, Modi. Serious talk. I gave an update on the progress of our Peace Formula. We have already passed many stages of presenting the Formula to the leaders and countries from different parts of the world. The day before, the Formula was successfully presented to the participants of the Arab League summit. And we will do everything so that the involvement of the world in our peace initiative is the fullest possible. I believe India will participate in the restoration of the rules-based international order that all free nations clearly need. We discussed support in demining, strengthening our medicine. I spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel. Security and defense, the economy, our common policy is the unification of the potentials of Ukraine and the entire European Union. I thank you, Charles, for your sincere, unwavering and effective support. I met with French President Macron. We regularly exchange views on the security situation, consider various options for our joint defense and political actions. And this time too. Meaningful conversation. Adds confidence in our movement to the victory of Ukraine. There was also a meeting with Chancellor of Germany Scholz. I thanked for Germany&#x27;s extremely strong support for our defense. These are air defense, the capabilities of our army on the ground, our economy, and our policy. We discussed with Olaf how we can speed up a fair peace for Ukraine, and how we can strengthen our joint work within the G7. And one more. As always, I&#x27;m thankful to our warriors! To everyone who protects the Ukrainian land, the Ukrainian sea, and the Ukrainian sky. We are sure we will return from this visit with even greater opportunities for you, our defenders! Glory to you – to all who are in a battle for our country, who are at combat posts and on combat missions, who train our soldiers, who heals our soldiers after injuries, and who help us protect life and independence. There is no such day that Ukraine does not become stronger! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We need global leadership of democracy - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s speech at the session of the G7 Summit and Ukraine </h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-21</span></div>
  <p>Mr. Kishida, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for the invitation to attend the Summit. Dear colleagues! During this war, Ukraine has already participated in the G7 meetings six times, but online only. Now is the time for a personal gratitude. Together with you and all of our allies and partners, we have achieved such a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected. There have been attempts to ignore and disregard what we value. But now it is impossible. Now our power is growing. Anyone who might want to wage aggression against a democratic country sees what the response will be. And the more we all work together, the less likely anyone else in the world will follow Russia&#x27;s insane path. But is this enough? Democracy needs more. I think we need the clear global leadership of democracy. This is the main thing that we provide with our cooperation. Let me give you a few examples. For years, we have heard that Russia can attack any country with impunity using hypersonic missiles that seem to be unstoppable. Russia wanted us to get scared and to betray our values, at some point. Well, that&#x27;s over. “Patriots” in the hands of Ukrainians have shown what democracy is capable of. Together we have proven that the question is not how many missiles our common enemy has, but how many air defense systems we have. Patriots, IRIS-T, NASAMS, Crotale, SAMP-T – they protect life in our cities and thus create a global brand of security for democracy. When Ukraine has enough of air defense systems to protect all our cities, the world will see what kind of air shield democracy can create. We decide – not our enemy – what the sky security will be like. I thank you, dear leaders, who helped Ukraine with air defense! Together we’ve saved thousands and thousands of lives from Russian missiles. I am also grateful for the decision to train our pilots on modern fighter aircrafts. The air shield can only be complete when ground-based air defense systems are complemented by modern aircraft in the air. We are now on the path to eliminating the capability gap. When our pilots know the F16 and when these aircraft appear in our skies, it will matter not only for Ukraine. This will be a historic moment for the entire security architecture in Europe and the world. Dear colleagues! For almost 15 months of full-scale war, we’ve made hundreds of security decisions together. These include the formation of coalitions of defense support, sanctions against the aggressor, protection of markets, including the energy and food markets, and protection of Ukraine&#x27;s financial stability. Every decision to protect Ukraine and freedom guarantees the preservation of the international rules-based order. As a house grows from bricks, so does freedom grow from our decisions – we guarantee it. We, the democracies. And our response, in fact, is a basis for mandatory rules for preventing aggression. Ukraine emphasizes the principle of preventive security. That’s why our proposals for the package of security guarantees for Ukraine – when they become operational – will become the peacekeeping factor. And not only for us. There are security umbrellas in the world. And they should open when the sky turns black. But how will it happen? And will freedom survive while the security umbrella is being expanded to include a new ally? As our actions during this war saved international law and freedom, our security guarantees will work to prevent the tragedy of war. They will work to stop the potential aggressor. Ukraine would like to see our teams dot the i&#x27;s and cross the t&#x27;s on security guarantees before Vilnius, the Summit that the Euro-Atlantic waits for. Thank you, President Biden, for giving meaning to the global brand of security for democracy! Thank you for leadership, weapons, and decision to train our pilots. I believe that the wings of our common freedom will be no doubt the strongest in the world! I thank both parties in the Congress, your team, Mr. President, and all freedom-loving American hearts. Thank you, Olaf, Mr. Chancellor, for your strong will which changes history in favor of democracy, and for the long-term defence and financial support of Ukraine, which gives strength to all of our free Europe. I thank your Government, I thank the Bundestag and all the people of Germany. Thank you, Rishi, dear Prime Minister, for your energy that gives us more visionary and far-reaching capabilities. I believe that your leadership will help to give true force of law when, together with our partners, we’ll create the Tribunal on Russia&#x27;s aggression. I thank your fellow ministers, the British Parliament and all the British people. Thank you, Emmanuel, Mr. President, for protecting the values of the Republic and for the fact that French support of Ukraine is a manifestation of respect for the freedom of nations, for equality in international relations and for fraternity among people. Thank you, France! Thank you, Giorgia Meloni, for the strength of her character that gives us all strength. I thank the Italian Government, the Parliament and all Italians who support the protection of our people. Thank you, Justin, dear Prime Minister, for your ability to be the first in many issues. It is very important to bring to results our joint work in Ukraine’s demining, it truly saves lives. I thank the entire political class and all the people of Canada who value peace so much. Thank you, Charles, thank you, Ursula, for making the European institutions more than institutions. They said once that European Union is a bureaucracy. And you prove that our community is based not on bureaucracy, but on common values which give us a strong course! Thank you, Fumio, dear Prime Minister, for the obvious leadership of Japan in Asia in protecting international law, thank you for the comprehensive support from your state and your people. Dear colleagues! We’re united by one more principle – rationality. We always act practically protecting our values. And the Ukrainian Peace Formula is an obvious expression of rationality. I thank you for supporting our Formula. The day before, I was at the Summit of the League of Arab States, and we’re doing everything to unite the whole world around the Peace Formula – around the Peace Summit, which will give momentum to the implementation of the Formula. And I would like to discuss the steps to make the Formula working and the details of the organization of the Peace Summit – as a part of our meetings today. Thank you.</p>

  <h2>Speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the working session of the Summit &quot;Towards a peaceful, stable and prosperous world&quot; with the participation of G7 countries, Ukraine and partners</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-21</span></div>
  <p>Dear Prime Minister Kishida! Dear leaders! We all have a chance to become co-authors of peace. This peace will not be for one country alone, just as this war is causing harm not only to Ukraine. The UN Charter and the rules-based order was ruined. Everyone has felt the destructive consequences of Russian aggression. Some have suffered from skyrocketing prices for food or energy resources. Some see that in the event of a disaster at a nuclear power plant occupied by Russia, radiation will reach their land, carried by the wind. Some know that if Russia succeeds in keeping the stolen Ukrainian territory, an aggressive neighbour will come to their land as well. Our world is vast, but we are all in it together. And this is our shared cause – peace. At the time, before the 24th of February, Ukraine held more than one hundred eighty rounds of negotiations with Russia – 183 – in various formats to stop the aggression. There were respectable international mediators in those negotiations, and they all saw that Russia was not looking for peace. Ceasefire didn’t work. It was in place for 7 years and thousands of people were killed. Nothing has changed, except that we, defending ourselves, have significantly weakened Russia. Now it openly wants to freeze the war – not for the sake of tranquility, but for the sake of gaining some time, gaining strength and striking again. The one who takes the path of terror does not leave it by himself. This is why our Peace Formula is needed. International law is needed. Ukraine proposed its Peace Formula to the world. As long as Russian invaders remain on our land, no one will sit down at the negotiating table with Russia. The colonizer must get out. And the world has enough power to force Russia to restore peace step by step. We proved it. For instance – food security. This is one of the tracks of our Peace Formula. When Russia blocked our sea, we found a way out. We have agreed with the UN and Türkiye to create a sea corridor for food exports so that no one in the world suffers from hunger or food shortages. Together we stabilized the markets. So we gave the world an element of peace. And by analogy, it can work on every other track of our Peace Formula, starting from nuclear, which is very dangerous, and energy security and ending with restoring the full force of the UN Charter and our territorial integrity, which was breached by Russia. We have developed the Peace Formula in a way that ensures each of its points is backed by UN resolutions. And in a way that everyone in the world can choose the track they can contribute to. By the way I wanted to tell you that all these points are based on these resolutions and all your countries in different years supported and voted for these resolutions. I think this is really important. From Japan to the Arab countries, from Europe to Latin America, we find support for our Formula. And we continue this work. In a short time, already in July, the full-scale war will enter 500 days. And that is a symbolic period of time, a good month to convene the Summit of the Peace Formula, the summit of the global majority. The summit of all those who uphold honesty and are determined to bring this war to an end. I invite you to join in the common efforts! Even if we are separated by distance, we are not decoupled by common understanding: You would defend yourselves if your home was broken-into, if the enemy came at your gate and deports your children, – you would not surrender to the colonizers, you would unite the whole world, you would fight – as we are fighting. Thank you!</p>

  <h2>Everyone in the world must do everything possible to ensure that wars leave only shadows on the stones of history – address by the President of Ukraine to the people of Japan</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-21</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much for your words of support. We really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Dear participants! Dear Japanese people! Everyone in the world who values peace! I came here from a country of which the war could have left only a shadow on the stones of history. But our heroic people are turning history around so that we can make the war itself become such a shadow. I believe that war has no place in the world. Humanity has come a very long way and lost many lives in bloody confrontations. Death fell from the sky, death came from the sea. Radiation brought death. People brought death to each other. Some say that the history of mankind cannot be imagined without war. We say that it is exactly war that the history of mankind should be without. Ukraine is at the epicenter of a war of destruction. Invaders have come to our land and they want not only to conquer us, Ukrainians. Russia is lying to the world that there are no Ukrainians at all. If we were not so brave, the Russian genocide against us could have succeeded. The shadow would have been left of Ukraine. Of the whole nation! Just a shadow. But Ukrainians are infinitely brave. They are infinitely freedom-loving. And we will live! And we will live freely. Even though the enemy uses non-nuclear weapons, the ruins of our cities, which were burned to the ground by Russian bombs and artillery, are similar to what I have just seen here - it is an honor to be in this Museum of Peace. Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. What your people have seen in their history: instead of the normal life of thousands and thousands of families, only ashes remain. Instead of cities, there is a scorched wasteland. Instead of houses - only rubble. Hiroshima is a rebuilt city now. And we dream of rebuilding all of our cities that are now in ruins, and every village where not a single house is left intact after Russian strikes. We dream of returning our territories. Just as we have returned our northern territories, which were occupied by Russia, we must return the eastern and southern territories of Ukraine. We dream of returning our people who are now in Russian captivity. These are prisoners of war, civilians, deported adults and abducted children. We dream of winning! We dream of peace after our victory. But for this to happen, not only this aggressor, but also the ambition of the war itself has to lose. And this is what is important for everyone in the world. I am here in Hiroshima so that the world can hear the Ukrainian call for unification from here. Russia has trampled on everything civilized. It has been occupying our largest nuclear power plant - the largest in Europe - for over a year now. Russia is the only terrorist state in the world whose tanks fired at a nuclear power plant. No one else has ever used a nuclear power plant as a depot for weapons and shells. Russia is hiding behind a nuclear power plant to fire rocket artillery at our cities. If anyone in the world is still able to ignore Russia&#x27;s other war crimes, this crime against humanity should definitely prompt action by everyone. We are saying this, Ukraine, which had to survive the Chornobyl radiation disaster in 1986. Until now, part of our land is a closed zone - an exclusion zone. Imagine, it was through this zone that Russian troops conducted their offensive. They were digging trenches right in the forests where the radiation-contaminated materials were buried back in Soviet times. If the level of evil and stupidity in Russia&#x27;s actions is left without consequences, the world will inevitably become a wreck. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before other criminals in public office want to start similar wars. If Russia is allowed to retain even a sliver of the territory it occupies, international law will never work again. Ukraine has proposed a Peace Formula. Honest and realistic. Its first point is radiation and nuclear safety. Russia must abandon radiation and nuclear blackmail of the world and hand over the nuclear power plant it is currently occupying to the full control of Ukraine and the IAEA. In total, our Peace Formula has 10 points, and the meaning of each of them is confirmed by UN resolutions. It contains everything that will work to end Russia&#x27;s war against our country. But the strength of the Ukrainian Peace Formula is that by stopping Russia&#x27;s aggressive ambitions and restoring the security that Russia has violated, we will give the world one additional result: we will paralyze other potential aggressors. When everyone who wants war sees how united and determined the world is when it wants peace, there will be no point in even starting a war. Until now, the world has not had a Formula that could stop aggressors. Ukraine offers it. Ukraine offers the world salvation from war. To do this, we need to unite and make Russia the last aggressor. So that only peace reigns after the defeat of its invasion of Ukraine. We, people, have different cultures, different views, different national flags. But we equally want security for ourselves, our children and grandchildren. And our lives are equally burned to ashes if, God forbid, war comes. Everyone in the world must do everything possible to ensure that wars leave only shadows on the stones of history and that this can only be seen in museums. Everyone in the world must respect other nations. Everyone in the world must recognize state borders. Everyone in the world must defend justice. Everyone in the world must care about life. Everyone in the world must take peace as their duty. Thank you, Hiroshima, for every blue and yellow flag on the streets these days. When there is a Ukrainian flag, it is evidence that there is faith in freedom, faith in life, faith in our people. Thank you! Thank you, Japan, Mr. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, all the people of Japan, for your comprehensive support! Eternal memory to all victims of wars! Let there be peace! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In Hiroshima, Ukraine was indeed an honored participant in the G7’s work, and the topic of Ukraine was principal – President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address.</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-21</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! We are finishing this very difficult yet very important week. On Friday, we had the Arab League. On Saturday and Sunday – G7 plus Ukraine and an expanded format – seven plus partners, including the Global South, plus Ukraine. It was intense. The world hears our position. Protection and security guarantees, the return of all our territories, all our people, justice, the implementation of our Peace Formula... We have an understanding with the world majority on every important point for Ukraine. And together we will increase Ukraine&#x27;s potential. This Saturday was Science Day in Ukraine, and the more opportunities we give to Ukraine, the more we give to everyone who works in this noble field. I congratulate all our scientists! Today, on Sunday, here in Hiroshima, Ukraine was a truly honored participant in the work of the G7. The topic of Ukraine is principal, the respect for all Ukrainians is special. I am thankful to the G7! Meeting with President Biden – and, as always, we become stronger after such talks. Meeting with the leader of Indonesia – meaningful. Meeting with the President of the Republic of Korea – there is potential for strong relations. Meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau – thank you, Justin. I also spoke with the leaders of Vietnam and Australia. We spoke separately and in detail with the Prime Minister of Japan – we will enhance cooperation. There was also a very important ceremony and address at the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima... Our unity with the world, our protection for Ukrainians, and our strength – the strength of the Ukrainian state – will also be the most worthy tribute to the memory of our people of different generations, whose lives have been broken and trampled by Russian evil, by this long-standing tyranny that changes its form but kills equally brutally. Today is the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Political Repression... the Day of Remembrance of all those who were killed in times of the Soviet regime. Let us not forget what happened, let us not forget whom we lost, and let us not forget that we must be strong. And we will always be. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every week we add value for Ukraine from the NATO Summit in Vilnius - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-22</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! We have already started preparing for this and the coming weeks. We expect new meetings and negotiations, so far to a greater extent – visits to us, to our state. There will be more weapons for our warriors. Every week we add value for Ukraine from the NATO Summit in Vilnius. We are doing everything to make sure that the decision at the summit is the one that will work for us. We&#x27;ll see, but still we&#x27;re working on it. By the way, today there is an important declaration from the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Things are called what they are: a clear recognition of Russia&#x27;s crimes against our country as genocide, a clear condemnation of ruscist ideology. This is the right basis for other international organizations as well. We are preparing for several interim security measures in our neighboring countries, those that support us the most. We will also make new appeals to ensure that the world understands Ukraine and to strengthen our ties with partners. And we will continue our intensive foreign policy, various non-standard formats, maximizing the world&#x27;s useful attention to Ukraine and our defense. More and more results for Ukraine – air defense, artillery, armored vehicles, shells, training – all of this is a must. Today I want to thank all our warriors who are defending the sky. From last night to this morning, they have shot down 25 Shaheds. 25 out of 25. An excellent result. And each such downing means saved lives, saved infrastructure. Thank you! They also managed to shoot down some of the terrorists&#x27; missiles, but unfortunately not all of them. Unfortunately, there were hits. Dnipro and Kharkiv, Odesa and Lviv, Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia - all our cities and communities need to receive a full-fledged air shield. We are working very hard on this together with our partners. Today, it is worth celebrating the units of the Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops, which are the most resilient and effective. The 3rd and 5th separate assault brigades, the 80th separate airborne assault brigade, the 93rd separate mechanized brigade &quot;Kholodny Yar&quot;, the 214th separate special forces battalion... Thank you, warriors! This is the Bakhmut direction, this is the extraordinary strength of our people. Glory to all our warriors who are destroying the enemy! Glory to all who protect our cities from terrorist attacks! Glory to all those who make our victory closer every day! Thank you to everyone in the world who supports us! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The key task of our state is to strengthen Ukraine and enhance our defense capabilities – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-23</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I was in the Donetsk region, at our frontline positions near Vuhledar and Maryinka. I had the honor to congratulate our marines on their professional holiday, the Day of the Ukrainian Marines. I presented state awards to the warriors and ribbons &quot;For Courage and Bravery&quot; to the best units defending this part of the frontline. I&#x27;m sure you remember these units – in my evening addresses, I often thank them for the extraordinary results they ensure for Ukraine in combat. Today I have awarded them personally. These are the 35th separate marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi, the 406th separate artillery brigade named after Brigadier General Oleksiy Almazov and the 140th separate reconnaissance battalion. These are very powerful units, and I am grateful to each of you, warriors! And thank you for the chevrons, it&#x27;s really a great honor! Today, exactly on the frontline, it was the right thing to announce the creation of a Marine Corps in Ukraine. New marine brigades will be added to our existing units, and we will provide them with modern weapons and equipment. In fact, this trip to the frontline was the final component after numerous meetings and negotiations with partners that took place these days and in the previous weeks. Everyone should understand this: the key task of our country and the purpose of virtually every international communication of ours is to strengthen Ukraine, to bolster our defense, to increase the capabilities of our warriors and our country as a whole. Every foreign visit and almost every negotiation allows Ukraine to become stronger. Of course, I would also like to thank our 36th separate marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilynskyi. This unit, fighting now, often deserves gratitude for its strength and efficiency. And it is fair to mention them now as well. Thank you and congratulations on your day! Warriors from the 137th separate marine battalion – I thank you today personally - every soldier – for the very good results you are achieving on the frontline. Well done! And congratulations on your holiday! Congratulations to everyone who is gaining respect for the title of Ukrainian marine! Today I also have the honor to thank other units of our defense forces who are fighting in the most violent areas... The 55th separate artillery brigade &quot;Zaporizhzhia Sich&quot; is always good, always effective. Thank you, warriors! The 59th separate mechanized infantry brigade named after Yakiv Handziuk is, as always, the strongest! Thank you! The 74th separate reconnaissance battalion - thank you, warriors! The 5th separate Slobozhanska brigade of our National Guard, which is fighting in the Luhansk region together with other units of the defense forces, defending its positions and destroying the Russian occupiers in the way that is necessary... Thank you, our warriors! I thank everyone who gives Ukraine strength! The strength of our state now, the strength of our defense now, is the basis of the strength of the rules-based international order. We will win together! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The first Ukrainian F-16 will be one of the strongest signals from the world that Russia will only lose - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-24</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Today, I held the first meeting of the Staff after all the important visits, meetings and decisions – defense decisions that we have been working on for quite some time and are now getting them in cooperation with our partners. First of all, this concerns the aviation coalition - a coalition of modern fighter jets for Ukraine. We are doing everything we can to reduce the time until the result is achieved, until new and powerful aircraft with Ukrainian pilots emerge in the Ukrainian skies. It is clear that this global step will allow us to expand our defense capabilities. Because it is only with powerful aircraft that an air defense system can be complete. On the other hand, the first Ukrainian F-16 will be one of the strongest signals from the world that Russia will only lose because of its own aggression, becoming weaker and more isolated. This will be a signal that Russian terror has lost, and our world, which is based on respect for independent nations and the right of peoples to choose their own path, has endured. We will prepare the necessary basis to ensure that our aviation transition is as quick and efficient as possible. Our warriors have already proved that they can master modern weapons with efficiency that was not expected from us. I&#x27;m sure they will be just as successful with the aircraft. The main thing is the speed of training and supply, i.e. the time that will pass between decisions and the actual defense of our skies. Today, as usual, I heard reports from the commanders, the Commander-in-Chief, the Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate on the current situation at the front, our counteraction to the occupier, and the capabilities that Russia is going to use against us. We know how to respond. In particular, this applies to the missile threat and the constant terror of kamikaze drones. Now Russia is increasingly resorting to so-called combined strikes - different types of missiles, different types of drones. I am grateful to our Air Force, to all our defenders of the sky, to our intelligence for improving our defense faster than Russia can change its terror tactics. If we take, for example, just one weapon of Russian terror, the Iranian Shaheds, our soldiers have shot down almost 900 of these drones to date. In total, about 1160 Shaheds have been used against Ukraine. We shoot down most of them. And we are constantly looking for tools to make the share of downed Iranian drones 100%. But today, given that such strikes are ongoing, I would like to appeal to the people of Iran directly. To everyone - to society, to Iranian ulama, to every Iranian family, to those people who are able to influence government decisions in Iran. A simple question: why do you want to be accomplices in Russian terror? Why are you on the side of the evil state? The world sees what is happening, and you all in Iran see it. Support for evil cannot be denied. Even though we have learned to shoot down most of your kamikaze drones that you are handing over to Russia, there are still hits. When an Iranian drone kills a pregnant Ukrainian girl and her husband in their home, why do you, mothers and fathers in Iran, need this? When your Shahed hits a dormitory with our students, people die, a fire starts, rescuers arrive, and in a few minutes a second Shahed hits, taking the lives of those who were saving the lives of others... Why does Iran need such cynical murders? Committed by Russia&#x27;s hands, yet with your weapons. What do you, the people in Tehran, or in Shiraz, or in Saqqez, or in any other city in your country, get from this? Unfortunately, even greater isolation from the world and even greater problems. For Russia, absolutely everything is a target. Homes, schools, hospitals, houses of worship, churches, power plants, markets, even humanitarian aid distribution points and bus stops... There are thousands of examples of this. People of Iran! Russia is hitting everything indiscriminately. With artillery and mortars, missiles and drones - with what it has and what Russia is given on your behalf. I am sure you must be on the other side of history - not with evil. Russia started this war for the sake of enslavement. It is a war of a colonizer against a neighboring nation. Russia even steals people - our children! Thousands and thousands... Only absolute evil can steal the children of another nation. And by going against Ukrainians, the Russian occupiers are destroying all other national communities that have lived on the land of Ukraine for centuries. The villages of Greek Christians burned by Russians and Russia&#x27;s systematic repression of the Crimean Tatar people, our Ukrainian Muslim community, are proof of this. The people of Iran could live a very different life if you were not put on the same side with such evil as Russian aggression. Your Shaheds who terrorize Ukraine every night only mean that the people of Iran are being pushed deeper and deeper into the dark side of history. Glory to all who defend life! Thank you to everyone in the world who helps strengthen our air defense, our aviation and save our people from Russian terror! If we are strong, we will live! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>When cities and communities of the European Union cooperate directly with cities and communities of Ukraine, it strengthens our Europe - President&#x27;s address to the EU Committee of the Regions</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-25</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President Cordeiro! Dear members of the Committee of the Regions! Dear Europeans! First of all, I would like to thank you for the fact that in this battle for the free future of Ukraine and of our whole Europe, we defend ourselves together. For many generations, Europeans have dreamed of our continent becoming united like today, when it comes to protection of our fundamental values. And now - Europe is united. And not only formally or institutionally, not only with declarations and hopes, but with real actions that save our people and our nations from Russian revanchism, which threatens not only our country, but the entire European way of life. And, in fact, now we are also united by this way of life. Like never before. From the Atlantic Ocean to the Eastern border of Ukraine, we share the same principles at the core of our social life, in governing our countries, at the core of interaction between the state and communities. Democracy and respect for the individual. Equality between people and communities. Respect for the others, and strength in the union of diversities. All of this is our Europe, all of this is us, and all of this can’t be found in our common enemy. We must remember this. We are fighting now not only for the future of our country, not only for the future of the Eastern flank of Europe, but for the future of the whole Europe, the way we know it today. And the way it should remain after us, ladies and gentlemen. When the cities and communities of Europe, your cities and communities, give shelter to our people they help not only people, but support the idea of Europe - our common home, for all Europeans. And I thank you for that! When both the EU Committee of the Regions and your cities and communities directly cooperate with Ukraine, with our cities and communities, it means cooperation that strengthens not only both sides, but also our Europe itself. Thank you for this! When we implemented the decentralization reform in our country, we focused on the best European practices of governing and subsidiarity of powers - between the center and communities. Currently, the system of governance in Ukraine - even in wartime conditions - corresponds to the European system of democracy. There may be different national approaches to a specific system of government in a certain country, but the main principle of respect for regions, respect for communities is indispensable for everyone. There are quite a lot of such examples - of our unity, of our common values, of our common rules of life. I am sure that all of them will soon give us an obvious result, which is the full-fledged accession of Ukraine to the European Union. And I thank you for supporting our country and our people on this path of integration! And I am also sure of one more thing: Ukraine will be such a part of Europe that there will remain not a single ruin. We will recover every ruin that Russia brought with its war - we will rebuild everything, we will make everything show that our strength – the strength of our Europe – is obvious. We established a special institution in Ukraine - the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. This is a platform that we invented to provide more opportunities for development to our regions and communities, to make better interaction between the central government and local authorities. Obviously, Congress must also play a fundamental role in the reconstruction efforts. I invite you to cooperate at all levels with the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Ukraine. Both at the level of the entire EU Committee of the Regions and directly: your regions with our regions, your cities and communities with our cities and communities. I invite you to join the work of the Offices of International Cooperation, which are being created with a view to greater efficiency in the work on the recovery of Ukraine. And I invite you, actually, to visit our country - to visit that part of our Europe in which the fate of our Europe is being decided both with weapons and rebuilding. Both by soldiers and institutions. Both at the level of the central government and at the level of each community, which appreciates that we are free Europeans. Thank you for your support! Thank you, Mr. President Cordeiro, for the Committee&#x27;s attention to Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The more Russian prisoners of war we will take, the more of our people we will return – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-25</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have another positive result from our team working on exchanges. We have returned 106 more of our warriors from Russian captivity - they fought in the Bakhmut sector. It is very important that there was no information about many of these 106 people at all - they were considered missing. But we found them. We brought them back home. 8 officers, 98 soldiers and sergeants... I thank everyone who made this possible. Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Lubinets, Malyuk, Klymenko – everyone who prepared this exchange – did a great job! Well done! Of course, I am also grateful to each of our soldiers who ensured that we have an appropriate exchange fund. Everyone on the frontline should remember this: the more Russian prisoners of war we will take, the more of our people we will return. Today I met with the Minister of Defence of Sweden in Kyiv. I thanked him for the continued support for our country and our soldiers. The meeting focused on strengthening our defense with armored vehicles. We also discussed our aviation coalition, which we are creating with our partners. Today, Finland has sent a new package of defense support – the 16th one. The total amount of this package is over 100 million euros. Thank you for this! Today, the Council of the European Union also made an important decision for Ukraine: trade liberalization for Ukrainian products was extended for another year. In fact, this means the complete abolition of duties and quotas by June 2024. This is a new stage in the sectoral integration of our economy - Ukraine and the entire European Union - that will definitely make us all stronger in Europe. As we move towards the European Union, we must make this liberalization, which is still temporary, permanent, and without any exceptions or restrictions. Which is actually in line with the spirit of a united and free Europe – without barriers. I thank our European partners for this decision! Anyone who wants strength and stability for the whole of Europe makes decisions like this. We have to be aware that there is a risk that some restrictions may still remain. If the pressure from individual governments on the EU continues. But domestic policy should not overlap with common European goals. So, I am sure we can find a solution, in particular for farmers in Ukraine and in some neighboring countries, that will meet our common European interests and standards. Today I had the honor to congratulate our State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine on its professional day. I thanked them for the fact that communication in Ukraine remains stable for the state, our military, and ordinary citizens despite all the threats. This is an important result that helps us steadily and effectively counteract the Russian occupiers. There is also much to thank our National Guard warriors for, particularly in the Zaporizhzhia sector. The 15th operational brigade of the National Guard destroyed a couple of Russian Su-type aircraft. I am grateful to two of our particularly accurate warriors. By the way, one of them has already been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine and has downed not only enemy aircraft, but also a cruise missile. Thank you, guys! Well done! Donetsk direction... The 128th separate mountain assault brigade, the 18th and 137th separate marine battalions and the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion particularly distinguished themselves. Thank you to each and every warrior! Glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone in the world who helps us! By the way, I had the opportunity to address the community of Johns Hopkins University. This is one of the leading educational institutions in the United States. Its alumni are powerful individuals, and some of them have had a significant impact on politics. I wished them to value time as much as possible. Because every day matters. The more we do today, the sooner we will end the war with our victory. And only ours. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I am certain you will continue to lead the free world, and this century will be our century, where freedom, innovation and democratic values reign – address by the President of Ukraine to the graduates of Johns Hopkins University</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-25</span></div>
  <p>Thank you, Mrs. Applebaum, for such a generous and yet brief introduction. Mr. President Daniels, Mr. Chairman of the Board of Trustees Foster! Dear students, faculty, parents, and guests of the University on this day! First of all, graduates of Class 2023... Congratulations on reaching this honourable milestone – graduation day at one of the world&#x27;s greatest universities. And if some of you are a little bit worried about whether my speech may delay your long-awaited graduation moment, I want to assure you that I will also try to be brief. Perhaps not as brief as Mrs. Applebaum was at the beginning, but anyway I will not be too long. Time is the essence. And it is the essence that I would like to talk about today. One of the most common truisms on Earth is the advice to value or at least not waste time. Why has it become so widespread? Every person eventually realizes that time is the most valuable resource on the planet. Not oil or uranium, not lithium or anything else, but time. The very flow of time convinces us of this. Some people realize this sooner, and these are the lucky ones. Others realize it too late, when they lose someone or something. People cannot avoid it – this is just a matter of time. Now you can look back at the time you have spent here at the university studying. Did you get everything you needed from it? You have even more time ahead of you – a whole lifetime. These are the careers you will build. This is your parents&#x27; pride, which they have every-right-to if they raised the children who graduate from Johns Hopkins. These are your families, who – I wish you this – will bring you love. These are your children and grandchildren who will inherit a piece of your soul... Will you be able not to waste this time of your life? This topic seems trivial, but these are very, very difficult questions for every person. How you answer them – is how you live. And while it is still possible to find new deposits of oil or lithium, and if in the future humanity can start mining resources in space, it is still purely science-fiction to live longer than has been given. But why am I talking about this now? Recently I was on the frontline again, in one of the most fiercely fought areas of the frontline against the Russian occupiers. I went to personally award the best fighters and to congratulate our marines on the Day of Marines of Ukraine. And you know... The front in Ukraine consists of very different people who are fighting for freedom and independence. These are people of all ages. And among them are exactly the same folks as you are now. Some of them have already passed their graduation ceremony, others are only dreaming about it. They and you have similar hopes for life, similar expectations from life. But there is a fundamental difference that comes down to the question of time. The time of your life is under your control. The time of life of our folks on the frontline, the time of life of all Ukrainians who are forced to live through this terrible Russian aggression... unfortunately, is subject to many factors that are not all in their control. Where will the next Russian missile or another Iranian killer drone – hit, which Russia is so fond of launching at Ukraine? Will our air-defence systems be able to save all the lives at risk? What moment in the battle can be the most risky and which-one could be decisive? And how long will this war last? We are trying to get a grip on the time of our lives – what is happening to us. And, by the way, if anyone here is going to become a politician, remember that this is exactly what your job will be – to master time. To make the time of your people and country&#x27;s life under the control of your people and country – under any circumstances. So that your people receive an answer to any question about what the time of their life will be like. There may be calm times when it is a simple task for politicians. There may be very, very restless politicians who complicate seemingly simple tasks so that they create real crises. There may be different things... And, unfortunately, there may still be wars. Of course, I do not wish anyone to feel like they are in my shoes. And it&#x27;s impossible to give a manual on how to go through life, so as not to waste its time. However, one piece of advice always works – you have to know exactly why you need today, and how you want your tomorrow to look like. You have to know this when you are a politician and have to achieve a certain goal for your country. You have to know this when you are a soldier and you have to defend your position so that the whole country is protected. You have to know this when you just have to go through life. Sometimes, however, when you’re young and when you’re a student, you still need to waste some time. What is life without it? But only sometimes, and when no one else depends on you. I am proud that Ukraine is not losing a single day in its defence against Russian terror. Every day we do everything to become stronger, to give more protection to people, to save more lives. The United States has also not lost a single day in helping Ukraine repel the Russian aggression. President Biden, a strong bipartisan coalition in Congress and most of all the American people have, like the generations before them, risen to this occasion and are leading the free world to secure freedom in Europe. We, Ukrainians, believe a free and secure Ukraine is the final step in the struggle to liberate Europe from the evil of tyrannies – this struggle that brought your great grandparents to the shores of northern France some 80 years ago. I have no doubt you will all soon become great doctors, lawyers, engineers and titans of new technologies and new businesses. Also I am certain, a few among you will heed the call to serve and become members of Congress, cabinet secretaries and, yes, maybe President one day… Of course after President Biden and please somebody of you – we don’t need surprises. I am certain, you – as your forefathers – will continue to lead the free world, and this century will be our century. A century where freedom, innovation and democratic values reign. A century where tyrannies – that repress their own and seek to enslave their neighbours – will vanish from Earth once and for all. But all of our tomorrows and the tomorrows of our children and grandchildren – depend on each of our todays. On each of our todays! Thank you, Johns Hopkins, for your attention! Thank you, America, for your support! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>During this week, we have also made substantial progress in providing modern aircraft for Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-26</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I just held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The questions are obvious. The front line, our defense, and our active actions, providing our soldiers with weapons and ammunition, equipment. Air defense and protection against terror. During the day, I receive reports on the situation in the city of Dnipro and the elimination of the consequences of another strike. It is a pure atrocity: a Russian missile, ballistics – against a hospital and a veterinary clinic. Absolutely sick creatures. As of this minute, two people have been killed in this strike. My condolences to families and friends! Debris clearance has not yet been completed. More than 30 people have been injured, including two children. We will do everything possible, everything impossible, to speed up the supply of more air defense systems of a higher quality to Ukraine – this is literally a daily issue for work with partners. During this week, we have also made substantial progress in providing modern aircraft for Ukraine, which will become a key component of our defense in the sky. We are moving faster in defense modernization than could have been predicted six months ago. General Syrsky made an important report at the Staff meeting – regarding the relevant directions in Donbas. Our soldiers are doing incredible things there, and every position retaken from the occupiers, every height occupied by our forces are new and new arguments for the world that Ukraine can, can win. Thanks to every soldier! Tavria, Odesa, Pivnich, defense of Kharkiv region – attention to each direction. Supplying equipment to offensive brigades. The Minister of Defense reported to me about the results of the Ramstein meeting – good results. Today, I also held a meeting with international experts regarding our movement in NATO – a more conceptual one. We have to use it – and we will use it! – every opportunity this month and next month, in general, this year, to fill our relations with the Alliance with real political content. I had an important conversation with Senator Graham, one of the most influential and experienced U.S. senators. We discussed the situation in our defense today, our needs in the near future. Thank you for understanding Ukraine! We are preparing several international appeals to increase support for our state and our struggle for freedom – support among our traditional allies and partners and in the countries of the Global South. I held a meeting devoted to new sanctions against those who support Russian aggression. And one more. Today Georgia celebrates Independence Day. I greet all the people of Georgia and wish them to be together with us and all other European nations in a free, peaceful and united European family. I wish this for the entire Georgia – and those parts of your country that are still under Russian occupation. Yet! Georgia is one of the ancient and respected historical forces, and this force CANNOT be defeated, I am sure of it. The occupier will lose. გაუმარჯოს თავისუფალ საქართველოს! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will continue our sanctions steps, and new, even more extensive sanctions packages are on the way – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-27</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today is another sanction day. Sanctions against legal entities and individuals – most of them are Russian – who work for terror. In total, 220 companies and 51 individuals. These are defense industry enterprises and related Russian companies. Enterprises serving the war. And the persons through whom these companies are managed. Not all of them operate on the territory of the terrorist state, some – in other countries. But everyone will get global pressure. Step by step, we collect complete data on everyone who works for aggression – directly or indirectly. Each such person will be blocked, and our Ukrainian sanctions are either already synchronized or will be synchronized with the sanctions of the free world. When Russia started this aggression, they looked at the world as if they were looking at themselves in a mirror. They thought that supposedly everyone in the world was as cynical and despised people in the same way as the masters of Russia do. But the world is different – the world helps us protect life. And anyone who goes against the world will become marginal. Russia will gain nothing and lose everything. Together with those who somehow try to help it in terror. We will continue our sanctions steps, and new sanctions packages are on the way – even more extensive. At the end of the week, I want to thank Japan for the new sanctions package against Russia. I&#x27;m also thankful for the new security assistance from Japan. It is what really saves lives. I&#x27;m grateful to Finland for the new defense package for Ukraine. This decision was also made this week. I&#x27;m thankful to Germany for transferring another batch of various types of defense equipment to our country to strengthen our defense against Russian terror, including defense of the sky. I want to thank Canada for its willingness to strengthen its leadership in supporting Ukraine. Thank you, Iceland, for helping our defense and our people. We will also make next week strong from the point of view of our cooperation with partners. We don&#x27;t lose a single week. And, as always, I&#x27;m thankful to our soldiers, each and every one who played a distinguished role during the week. Bakhmut direction... 80th Separate Air Assault Brigade – thank you, warriors, for your active actions! It is exactly what is needed. Glorious 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade Kholodny Yar – thank you for your resistance and courage! Well done! Lyman direction... 81st Separate Airmobile Brigade – thank you, guys, for your efficiency in destroying the enemy! Tavria task force... 35th and 36th separate marine infantry brigades, 55th Separate Artillery Brigade, 59th Separate Motorized Brigade, and paratroopers of our 79th Air Assault Brigade – I thank you all! As always – strong, as always – effective! Glory to all who defend our state! Glory to all who help! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Kyiv and all our cities, the whole of Ukraine will put an end to the history of Moscow&#x27;s despotism – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-28</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, our country went through one of the largest Russian attacks by Shaheds – 54 drones at a time. Almost all of them were shot down... Almost! Unfortunately, there were some hits in the Zhytomyr region. We will do everything to help restore what has been destroyed. But still, most of the destruction was averted, and most of the lives that could have been taken by these Shaheds were saved. I am grateful to each and every person who made it possible! Anti-aircraft missile troops and aviation of the Air Force, air defense of the Ground Forces and our mobile fire groups... Thank you, warriors! During this terrorist attack, the most powerful strike was aimed against the Kyiv region. Within the city of Kyiv and the region, 36 drones were shot down. This is how Russia celebrates the day of our ancient Kyiv... Throughout its history, Kyiv has seen various meannesses from invaders. It has survived them all, and it will survive the ruscists. None of them will be here! Kyiv and all our cities, our entire Ukraine, will put an end to the history of Moscow’s despotism, which has been bringing enslavement to many different peoples for a very long time. Neither Shaheds nor any other means of terror that it humiliatingly seeks around the world will save it. Because strength is in people, it is in cities, it is in life, and when life, people, and the most important cities for culture are despised, Russia will only face defeat. And even hundreds of Shaheds will not save it from this. They will only enlarge Russia&#x27;s disgrace. These days, we congratulate Kyiv and Oleksandriya, Severodonetsk, Kalush, Kryvyi Rih... Cities of different destinies, but of our equal respect. Our Ukraine. Our faith that we will pass this extremely difficult stage of history... We will, and all our cities will be free, and our people will be protected from any evil that may threaten our country. Today I want to thank all our people who have fought and are fighting for Ukraine - all our warriors, all branches of the Armed Forces and all kinds of troops, every brigade, every unit. Thank you! To all those who are in combat, to all those who are on combat missions, to all those who are at combat posts! And I thank everyone without whom we cannot imagine effective resistance of the state and effective defense of our cities. I am grateful to each and every one who trains our warriors and heals their wounds. Who produces and supplies weapons. Who provides our logistics and communications. I thank everyone who provides Ukraine with intelligence information and who spreads the truth about the war and Russian terror around the world. I am grateful to each and every one who ensures our rescue operations after enemy attacks and eliminates their consequences. I am grateful to everyone in the world who cares and who wants freedom to win as much as we do. All our power engineers and transport workers. Thank you! Ukrzaliznytsia. Defense industry. All our volunteers. United24 and our ambassadors. Thank you! Our law enforcement officers. Local authorities. Employees of public utilities. Our education system. Our cultural figures. Our historians. All those who keep jobs and all those who create jobs - no matter what. Our farmers, workers of our agricultural sector. Our industry. Our IT specialists. Our civil servants. Our diplomats. I thank everyone who strengthens our defense, our state, and our people! The fact that our capital is free, the fact that our cities defend themselves with dignity, the fact that we will liberate every currently occupied city - all this is the merit of many people. All those who are fighting and working for Ukraine. This is the merit of our powerful nation that knows how to do historic things. When it is united. When it realizes its strength. When it forgives the enemy nothing. And when it inspires the whole world. We are going forward until we liberate all of our Ukrainian land... We are defending every city... We take care of each other and remember all our people whom we have to bring home from Russian captivity to their cities and villages. Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to all who care about our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine to the American people on the US Memorial Day</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-29</span></div>
  <p>On behalf of all Ukrainians, I would like to honor the courage and self-sacrifice of all Americans who stood in defense and keep defending freedom. Your freedom stood, thanks to those who fought for it. Our freedom will stand, thanks to those who are fighting for it. The freedom is underpinned by the bravery of the best of their kind and by the readiness of young men and women who serve their nation in the military to become the best of their kind and make their bravery the basis for the future of their nation. When we remember the warriors who sacrificed their lives in the name of freedom, we recall the reason – why we are alive, why we live the way we like and why our free nations stand. It is our duty – to teach children that freedom cannot be taken for granted. It is our duty – to teach them to be grateful. It is our duty – to acknowledge each and every one who dedicated their lives to defend the freedom, the noble and free banner of their country and people. It is our duty to remember – what price was paid to keep the light of freedom, despite all dark times that came down. We, Ukrainians, will always be grateful to the US and every American for an extraordinary support which helps us confine the Russian tyranny to the losers – those who lost to freedom. My special gratitude on this Memorial day goes to all Americans of different times – sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, who became warriors and whose strength turned into the strength of freedom and who were destined to show to the world that freedom will always shine bright on the hill. Let our victory, of the Ukrainian warriors, make this light shine brighter! God bless America! Слава Україні!</p>

  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very long day, and it started very early for many of our people. Several Russian terrorist attacks in one day. Shaheds, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles. Guided bombs. Thanks to our air defense, to all the defenders of the sky, at least hundreds of lives were saved today. In just one day. Most of the Shaheds and missiles were shot down. But each such terrorist attack brings us and the whole world to an obvious conclusion: Russia wants to follow the path of evil to the end, that is, to its defeat, because evil cannot have any other end but defeat. The world must see that terror is losing. When Patriots in the hands of Ukrainians ensure one hundred percent downing of any Russian missiles, terror is losing. When the world increases pressure on Russia, including sanctions, when the terrorist&#x27;s isolation grows, when its former partners are ashamed of any closeness with Moscow, terror is losing. And, of course, there is no greater humiliation for a terrorist state than the success of our warriors. In fact, with our success, our pressure, our Patriots we must and will continue to respond to all manifestations of Russia&#x27;s evil. And we will destroy this evil. No one else in the world uses weapons against evil more effectively than Ukrainians. Today, I held a meeting of the Staff. The reports are very specific. Supply of new air defense systems and missiles to them, relevant agreements with partners. The effectiveness of our air defense and what can make our air defense stronger. Hits that, unfortunately, took place. Our defense forces are able to learn and will do everything to make it much more difficult for terrorists. As usual, the Commander-in-Chief and the commanders of the operational directions reported to the Staff. Not only the supply of ammunition, not only the training of new brigades, not only our tactics. But also the timing. This is what is most important. The timing of how we will move forward. We will. The decisions have been made. I thank every soldier and sergeant, officer and general, and every prepared brigade. Today I also had a very informative meeting with our international staff. We are preparing new joint steps with our partners to strengthen our defense. And for our active actions. There is no alternative to the complete liberation of our land. There is no alternative to the full protection of our values. And I am grateful to all our partners who understand that respect for every human life, human freedom and international law are values on which no compromise is possible. I would like to thank Denmark today – the entire nation, the entire Danish political class. Thank the Parliament, the Government and Prime Minister Frederiksen personally for the decision to increase financing of the Danish Fund of support for our country by more than USD 3 billion. The total amount of defense assistance from Denmark will now reach more than $4 billion 700 million. This is very significant. Such decisions make the defeat of Russian terror faster. Thank you for this! Today I spoke with Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen. I thanked him for his principled support of international rules, of everything for which nations are united by the UN Charter and conventions binding for all. I invited Cambodia to join joint efforts with various countries of the world in implementing our Peace Formula. This is a common global task – to prevent Russia from making terror something usual to the world so that it leads to someone else catching this evil virus. And just before recording this address, I had two more conversations. I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. I informed him about the terrorist attacks. I thanked him for his readiness to continue helping us protect people. The Netherlands is among the leaders in helping protect against terror and bring terrorists to justice. We discussed our defense cooperation – our new aviation coalition, a coalition of modern fighter jets that we are creating. And we will create it! Of course, we also discussed strengthening our air defense. I spoke with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. I congratulated him on winning the elections. I am confident that our further cooperation – Ukraine and Türkiye – at all levels will bring even more benefits to our people and international stability. The security of our region and the whole of Europe, global food security, and the protection of fundamental norms of international law are what we did, do and will continue to do together. Thank you to everyone in the world who helps! Glory to all our warriors! Thanks again to the Air Force and all our defenders of the sky. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We continue consolidating partners to make Ukrainian air defense as effective as possible – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-30</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on this day. A pretty loud day. First, I thank our Air Force and all the defenders of the sky for repelling another night raid by Russian drones. Again and again, I thank our warriors for every downed Shahed, for every downed Russian missile. Because it always means saved lives, saved infrastructure. Second, unfortunately, there were hits, unfortunately, there were falling debris with the corresponding consequences, unfortunately, there were losses... My condolences! It is very, very important to take air raid alerts into account and not to take them carelessly. I want all the local authorities responsible for specific communities and territories to hear me now. Shelters in cities should be accessible. People need to understand when and how the number and availability of shelters will increase. This is the responsibility of specific officials, and it is a specific responsibility. Third, we continue to consolidate our partners to make Ukrainian air defense as effective as possible. Russian terror must be defeated every day and every night, in every region of Ukraine, in the skies of every Ukrainian city and village. When any attack by Russian terrorists ends in failure for the terrorists, their defeats will become a source of our long-term security. Today I spoke with German Chancellor Scholz, in particular about air defense. I thanked him for the air defense systems already provided to Ukraine, that is, for the lives of our people already saved by Germany. We also discussed the overall defense situation and our security cooperation. On the eve of important international events that will take place shortly, we are coming up with common positions and decisions. And I thank Olaf, Mr. Chancellor, for his personal determination, which in many ways becomes the determination of the whole of Europe. Fourth, I spoke with representatives of the powerful British defense company BAE Systems. This is a truly large-scale weapons manufacturer – the weapons that we need now and that we will need in the future to ensure the security of our country and the entire region. We are working to create an appropriate base for production and repair in Ukraine. We are talking about a wide range of weapons: from tanks to artillery. We will provide Ukraine, and thus the whole of Europe, with this new foundation of strength. Fifth, today I met with the delegation of one of the world&#x27;s leading think tanks, the American Atlantic Council. It was a good, useful conversation to protect our common values, those of everyone in the world who cherishes freedom. I informed the Atlantic Council representatives about our current main defense needs in the confrontation. We discussed the steps that bring the creation of a new aviation coalition closer. We are steadily moving closer to this result - to providing our warriors with modern fighter jets. And I thank all the people of the United States, each and every one in the political community who supports us, I thank President Biden personally and both parties in Congress. Now, in Ukraine, on our land, in our sky, it is being decided whether freedom and civilization will retain global leadership in this century. Decided by us, together with America, together with Europe, together with all our allies and partners. I thank everyone in the world who helps us! And, of course, today, as always, I thank our warriors. All those who are now fighting for Ukraine. All those who are on combat missions. At combat posts. The Avdiivka sector, Bakhmut, Maryinka, Shakhtarsk sector. I thank everyone who defends our positions in Luhansk and Kharkiv regions. I am grateful to each and every one who defends Zaporizhzhia and Kherson region. I thank everyone who keeps our border strong. Our brigades that are fighting. Our brigades that are ready to move forward. And our intelligence. Our security forces. On all fronts and at all levels, the enemy must feel that Ukraine has become stronger. Glory to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>All 462 days we’ve been fighting for our future, hence, for our children, for their freedom and their destiny - speech by the President of Ukraine at &quot;UA: War. Unsung Lullaby&quot; conference on the occasion of the International Children&#x27;s Day</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-31</span></div>
  <p>Dear participants and guests of the Conference! Dear ladies and gentlemen! Dear attendees! Dear journalists and public figures! &quot;Man has a drive and rage to destroy and kill. Until humanity undergoes a major change, there will be wars. Everything that has been built and cultivated will be destroyed and distorted, and then humanity will have to start all over again...&quot; These words are many years old, 80 years old. These words belong to a person known all over the world, a person who, in the opinion of many, changed history. She is not a politician, not a religious figure, not a scientist, not an artist, and, perhaps most importantly, not an adult. These are the words of a child. A 13-year-old girl, Anne Frank. The diary that she’s been keeping for two years of hiding during the Nazi occupation shook the world. But it failed to warn it. And the proof of this is the appearance in the twenty-first century of a new terrifying child&#x27;s diary written by an eight-year-old boy, Yehor, in the blockaded Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which was then being destroyed by the troops of the Russian Federation. The general situation with the protection of children&#x27;s rights during such a war and, in fact, the main issues of this important conference are actually reflected in this diary. Without embellishments, briefly, in very simple and at the same time very painful words. This diary begins as follows: &quot;WAR. I slept well, woke up and smiled.&quot; We live in a time when this is happiness for children. When there are air raid sirens every night, and just sleeping is happiness, it is valuable. When there are missile attacks every night, and waking up in the morning is truly priceless. This has been going on for 15 months. For 15 months, Russian aggression and terror have been destroying not just buildings, but fundamental human rights - the fundamental rights of our children. The right to a safe environment, the right to education, the right to development, the right to health care, the right to rest, leisure, and, most importantly, the inalienable and most important right of a child to life. The right that Russia has taken away from at least 483 Ukrainian children, and these are just the fates we know for sure. One should always call a spade a spade - and I am a supporter of this - not with certain official formulations, which, in my personal opinion, somewhat distort the truth, blur the essence and soften the horror of all that Russia has done and is doing. Russia killed - and this is why I will use such wording - Russia killed 483 children at least. It killed them. This is not something that can be called &quot;they were victims of Russian aggression&quot; or &quot;they died as a result of the armed conflict&quot;. No, Russia killed these children. Russia maimed almost a thousand more children. And this cannot be described as &quot;they were injured as a result of hostilities.&quot; Yehor, a boy from Mariupol, knows this pain. The following memories from his diary are about it. And it is especially scary when you realize that these words are written in a child&#x27;s handwriting. &quot;I have a wound on my back, the skin is torn off. My sister has a head wound. My mom has meat torn out of her arm and a wound on her leg...&quot; Continuing to call a spade a spade, we should mention another consequence of the Russian Federation&#x27;s aggression. These are millions of families and children whose homes were destroyed by Russia absolutely deliberately. And it cannot be said that &quot;they lost their homes because of the hostilities&quot;. It is important to say what really happened. Russia destroyed the homes of millions of people. Millions of crippled lives, millions of broken dreams. Or, to put it simply, harshly, as in the diary of an eight-year-old boy named Yehor: &quot;My grandmother Galya, two dogs, and my favorite city of Mariupol died...&quot; Unfortunately, we know that there are many such towns and villages in Ukraine. Wiped off the face of the earth. Whole neighborhoods, streets, houses, under the rubble of which Russia has buried the concept of &quot;children&#x27;s rights&quot;. It attacked them all - from the very moment of birth to adulthood. These are the missiles that hit the maternity hospital in Mariupol and the maternity hospital in Kherson. Kindergartens in Okhtyrka, Slovyansk, Stanytsia Luhanska and more than a thousand more kindergartens across our country. Schools in Kramatorsk, Lozova, Chasiv Yar, a lyceum in Kryvyi Rih, a gymnasium in Mykolaiv, and a total of 1300 schools across our country. Okhmatdyt Children&#x27;s Hospital, Kherson Regional Children&#x27;s Clinical Hospital and more than a thousand medical facilities in total. A children’s house in Druzhkivka, a rehabilitation center for children with disabilities in Kherson, schools for children with special educational needs, for children with hearing impairments in Zaporizhzhia region and for children with visual impairments in Kharkiv. The Palace of Children and Youth in Bakhmut, in our strong Bakhmut. A children&#x27;s library in Nikopol. Children&#x27;s and youth sports schools across the country: Severodonetsk, Maryinka, Rubizhne, Bashtanka. Stadiums in Chernihiv and Mykolaiv. Ice arenas in Kharkiv and Mariupol. Halls, pitches, swimming pools, hundreds of other facilities where our children practiced various sports. And... thousands and thousands of children who were kidnapped, torn from their lives, separated from their families and illegally deported to Russia. We don&#x27;t know the exact number of our children – unfortunately, this is still true. But we know that we have to return them all. We know that we must restore the rights and security of all Ukrainian children. Our state is making every effort to bring back Ukrainian children, to return them to normal life, to bring our children home to Ukraine. An important step was taken yesterday. And, if I may use such words today, I would like to support and congratulate the Center for Rescue and Protection of Ukrainian Children, our headquarters for rescuing and protecting children, on its launch. It is a platform on which we can unite the efforts of state and international institutions to implement the Bring Kids Back UA strategy for the protection and safety of Ukrainian children. This is a detailed and step-by-step action plan - an approved action plan - that provides for the return of children deported by Russia, their reintegration, socialization, humanitarian assistance, very important psychological support, implementation of modern educational initiatives, work to record all crimes committed against our children and ensure justice for them, development of family-based forms of upbringing, and a number of other actions to ensure every right of every Ukrainian child. In fact, all of this is the point of our conference, what needs to be discussed today, now. In addition, this conference will launch a number of important international events, including in Sweden, Norway and other countries. I think the team will talk about this in detail today, and the ombudsman will speak about it. We will unite the global majority to restore safety for Ukrainian children. We all understand that only our just victory can restore and realize all the rights of our children - in full and at a higher quality level. And we understand this. Complete de-occupation of all our territories. Full security in peaceful cities and villages. Hence, respective support for Ukraine from the world with weapons and equipment, air defense systems, pressure on the terrorist state in any direction... All this not only gives an advantage on the battlefield, not only accelerates a purely military victory, but also brings the victory of civilization closer, the return of normal life, European life, the life of an independent state with all human rights and all the rights of our Ukrainian children. We will stand to the end, and we will never give up or lose heart. I think the whole world already realizes this. Just as the eight-year-old boy did not give up despite everything. And it is much harder for him than for many of us. It&#x27;s true, he&#x27;s pulling through. &quot;I woke up. Well, just like yesterday, I smiled. My grandmother went to get water. She came back. By the way, my birthday is coming up...&quot; Ladies and gentlemen! Ensuring the rights of every child begins from the moment of birth, the moment of appearance in the world that humanity has built over the years - a world that, unfortunately, is full of such catastrophes, such rage, such wars. Full of such disasters. Every child should have an unconditional and inalienable right, regardless of the date of birth. This year, in this century or in many generations to come, every child should have the right to be born in a safe, peaceful and, most importantly, free world. It is our duty to guarantee this right. The duty of all free nations, all honest leaders. This is the world we are fighting for today. And it is these rights for every child that we have been defending for nine years and 462 days. We are repelling Russian aggression. And we often emphasize that we are defending not only Ukraine - and we want not only us to realize this - but also the entire free Europe, the entire free world, and the rights of all free people. And this is objective, deserved, not just diplomatic – it is frank, humane and very honest, but at the same time not decisive. Because first and foremost, we protect children. All of our children. Since February 24, Children&#x27;s Day has been every day for us. All 462 days of the full-scale war. 462 days of our battle - first of all, for our future, hence, for children. For their freedom and their destiny. For the Ukraine we will leave to them. The Europe we will build together. The world in which they will live freely. Today we are fighting for what this world will look like. And that is why when we say &quot;our children&quot; we mean not only Ukrainians. We are fighting together for children - for all children, for all future generations, for their rights and liberties. What we call &quot;tomorrow&quot; is what we want to build and pass on. What we call the future and can only imagine will be the present for them and the realities they will definitely inherit from us. We will rebuild everything destroyed by the Russian occupiers. We will do everything to ensure that every Ukrainian child can return home to Ukraine. To their city, their yard, their house, their room, their bed, their childhood. Return to a normal life. Where there will be no war. There will be no concepts like &quot;internally displaced persons&quot;, and – what really hurts – &quot;refugees&quot;, no such painful concepts as &quot;deportation&quot;. Where dad&#x27;s fairy tale and mom&#x27;s lullaby will be heard live, not via video. Where there will never again be new diaries by Anne Frank and Yehor from Mariupol. Where it is safe. Where it is free. And peaceful. Hence, where Ukraine is. Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world is aware of a fundamental role of our maritime grain exports for food security - address by the President Volodymyr Zelenskyy </h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-05-31</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I am on a working trip to our Odesa. Here I thanked our warriors for defending the region and the whole of Ukraine. In particular, I visited a hospital and our wounded defenders. I wished them a speedy recovery. I was honored to present state awards. I thanked our doctors. I held a special and lengthy meeting in Odesa on the security and social situation in the region. The regional leadership, military, law enforcers. The region is a priority from all points of view. It is Odesa region that is one of the pillars of security for our entire south, and therefore for the state. The Security Service of Ukraine has achieved very important results in Odesa region in countering Russian saboteurs. General Moskalov delivered a report on the situation in the areas of responsibility of the Odesa operational and strategic groups of troops. We analyzed in detail how to strengthen the defense. We also discussed economic issues, jobs, and social security in detail. I also held an offsite meeting of the Staff. Constant attention to the front. Reports from the commanders of Khortytsia, Tavria, and the Commander-in-Chief. Special reports from the heads of the Main Intelligence Directorate and the Security Service. Details will follow later. Special attention is paid to our grain corridor and security in the Black Sea. The world knows the fundamental role of our maritime grain exports for food security. In general, security in the Black Sea, the effectiveness of international law on navigation is a globally important security factor. All the maritime countries of the world see now what could threaten their ports and their water areas if Russia gets away with blocking navigation in the Black Sea. Let me give you just one example. Currently, out of the 3 ports that have been agreed upon as part of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the Pivdennyi port is actually blocked. More than 1.5 million tons of agricultural products have been accumulated in Pivdennyi alone. And this grain is expected by at least ten countries, including Türkiye, Egypt, Bangladesh and China. Obviously, the less food is supplied to these countries, to these regions, the higher the food prices are, the more people in these countries lose from their family budgets. That is, the blockade of one port in Ukraine creates extremely severe risks for different nations. In particular, for those countries relations with which Russia is also trying to speculate on. I thank everyone in the world who helps us increase the security space in the Black Sea, who puts pressure on Russia to unblock food supplies. Today in Odesa, I also held a meeting on the development of our port infrastructure. And one more thing. We are working to make the second half of this week meaningful for our relations with partners. Our international team is doing everything to ensure that this week ends with the news Ukraine needs. And now I thank the United States of America, President Biden personally, both parties of Congress and every American - everyone who values freedom - for a new defense package for our warriors. Missiles for Patriots, rockets for HIMARS, artillery and other strongly needed weapons. Needed right now! Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat for the sake of Ukraine, who are at combat posts, on combat missions. I thank everyone who works for our country! Thank you, Odesa, for this day! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every doubt in Europe is a trench that Russia will definitely try to occupy – speech by the President of Ukraine at the second meeting of the European Political Community</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-01</span></div>
  <p>Madam President of Moldova, Mr. President of the European Council, Dear colleagues! Today, and every time we prepare and make decisions for the sake of our Europe, for the sake of our values, we must remember that every doubt we show here in Europe is a trench that Russia will definitely try to occupy. Whether these doubts are about vital security steps, or doubts about our unity, or maybe about our ability to meet the challenges of our time… every doubt brings more insecurity. Here in Moldova, luckily, we don&#x27;t hear air raid sirens or the sound of Russian artillery. But not so long ago, Russia&#x27;s rulers were, unfortunately, convinced that between the evil they brought to Ukraine and the occupation of Moldova, there were only a few days, a week at most. And now they think the same way. But we act, we all, and this brings more security. Since February 24 last year, the limits of security in Europe have in fact been the limits of our determination, our ability to act together for the sake of the interests of our peoples and the whole Europe. As much as we can reject doubts, we can reject the evil of aggression. There is no one among us who does not know what solutions Europe needs now. The first is a full-fledged defense against Russian terror. Both on the ground and in the sky. Russian missiles claimed three more lives this night in our capital, in Kyiv, ten injured. One child killed – in addition to the hundreds killed by Russian terror earlier! At least 484 Ukrainian children killed by Russia. There are two decisive components now: a coalition of “Patriots” that will put an end to Russian blackmail by ballistic missiles, and a coalition of modern fighter jets that will prove that terror against our cities has no chance. And I thank those who are helping, those who understand that every step in air defense enforcement is literally saving lives, and the speed of forming these two coalitions – the coalition of “Patriots” and the coalition of modern fighter jets – is literally accelerating peace. The second is the full power of our unity. We do see who the aggressor is. We see where the aggression is taking place. Russia is afraid of NATO – it’s true – and tries to swallow only those who are outside of the common security space. And Russia tries to leave a “frozen” war on the territory of its neighbors if it fails to swallow the entire neighboring country. For example, why is the Russian contingent still in Transnistria? The Kremlin only needs it to unfreeze its attack on Moldova one day. How long will Europe tolerate this? This question is already more than thirty years old. And it is worth answering. There should be no place for any &quot;frozen&quot; or hot war on our continent! Recently, a Chinese journalist asked me – why NATO. The answer is simple: when there are no security guarantees, there are only war guarantees. We haven’t heard about the possibility of the security alliance between China plus NATO plus Ukraine… But we need peace, just peace. That is why every European country that borders Russia and that does not want Russia to tear it apart, should be a full member of the EU and NATO. And there are only two alternatives to this – either an open war or a creeping Russian occupation. We see what is happening in Belarus. We see what is happening in Georgia. We see how these nations are being dragged, although in different ways, into the same state of lawlessness. But what do they see? If even Ukrainians, who are proving our commitment to freedom and the values of a united Europe with blood, have not yet heard a clear positive answer about joining the EU and NATO, the hopes of others are becoming completely elusive. Think about this disappointment – the disappointment of both our soldiers who are fighting for freedom and those nations for whom our struggle in Ukraine is their hope. This year – is for decisions. And this is the third point I would like to emphasize. In summer – in Vilnius, at the NATO summit – the clear invitation to membership for Ukraine is needed, and the security guarantees on the way to NATO membership are needed. In fall, on our accession to the EU – clear positive decision is needed. And we are also preparing the Peace Summit, which will guide the world majority to implement the joint Peace Formula, and it is a global need. The time has come, and the doubts must vanish. Positive decisions for Ukraine will be positive decisions for everyone. A security basis. Obviously, for Moldova. It’s very important. In the long run – for Georgia. I have no doubt that over time – for Belarus as well. And thus, for European peace. Because there will be no trench of doubt for aggression against anyone in Europe. And I thank all of you who understand that Europe must be so far-sighted to be truly peaceful. The Ukrainian approach is obvious and the most open. We openly proposed the Peace Formula, and its points are obvious. We speak openly about the importance of NATO and the direct link between the reduction of our doubts and the expansion of our space of real security. We openly say that only a strong air defense, namely the coalition of “Patriots”, namely the coalition of modern fighter jets can defeat Russian terror. It’s real life in which we live and fight every day. This is the openness on which our Europe is based, one of our main joint principles. These are facts, obvious facts. Openness and honesty. Now we need decisions. Thank you very much for the invitation, Maia! Thank you very much for hosting us! Thank you for your attention! Long live Europe! Salut Moldova! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>The duty of local authorities is to ensure the availability and accessibility of shelters around the clock – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-01</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! This long and hard day is coming to an end. First of all, my condolences to the families and friends of those whose lives were taken by Russia, taken by Russian strikes. We are doing our best to protect people. There was no such international meeting, no such international negotiations where the issue of air defense for Ukraine was not raised. But protecting people means protecting them at all levels. Shelters must be accessible. The situation like last night in Kyiv, when people came to the shelter and the shelter was closed, should never happen again. It is the duty of local authorities, a very specific duty, to ensure that shelters are available and accessible around the clock. It is painful to see the negligence of this duty. It is painful to see casualties. And if the duty is not fulfilled on the ground, it is the direct responsibility of law enforcement bodies to bring to justice. Today, our country, like many other countries, marks Children&#x27;s Day. But even on this day, the terrorist state took the life of a Ukrainian child. But even on this day, Russia shelled our cities - from Kharkiv to Kherson, from Kyiv to Donbas. But we used this day to the maximum to bring the terrorists&#x27; defeat closer. And this day has become a time when we are bringing Russia&#x27;s accountability – accountability of every murderer, every terrorist – closer. This morning, our Ukrainian delegation was in Moldova for the Summit of the European Political Community. This is the center of political discussions on our continent now. We had very important negotiations. The President of Moldova and the President of France, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President of the European Commission, the President of Romania and the Prime Minister of Portugal, the Prime Minister of Albania and the Prime Minister of North Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Italy, the Prime Minister of Spain, the President of Switzerland, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, the President of Azerbaijan, the Chancellor of Germany. There was also an expanded format with representatives from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, UK, Poland and Belgium. And, of course, there were meetings on the sidelines of the Summit and a joint meeting of all the participants... We are preparing new defense decisions for Ukraine, including air defense, aviation, and our advance on the ground. We are preparing real political content for the NATO Summit in Vilnius. We are preparing a package of security guarantees for our country on its way to the Alliance. We are doing everything to bring the EU&#x27;s political decision on membership for Ukraine closer. We are preparing a Peace Summit based on the Ukrainian Peace Formula. And I thank all the leaders, all the countries that support us on these points. This is not only support for Ukraine, it is support for real security for the whole of Europe. I would like to thank Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, for supporting our initiatives to protect our children, to find and return those young Ukrainians who were deported to Russia. We have to return them all, we have to do everything possible and impossible to protect all our people – to the maximum extent possible – from any Russian threats. I am confident that this is possible. I would like to thank President Michel, President of the European Council, who today held a special security session at the summit. I would also like to thank Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, for the decision on ammunition for Ukraine – for supporting the allocation of additional 500 million euros for this purpose. Thank you! Thank you to all our warriors! Thank you to everyone who trains our warriors! Who helps us with weapons! Who provides treatment for our heroes after their injuries! I thank all the rescuers, all our employees of the State Emergency Service and other services who are eliminating the consequences of Russian strikes! Thank you to all the volunteers who help our warriors, our people, our country! I thank everyone with whom we are walking side by side towards our victory, towards our peace and towards punishment for Russian terrorists. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukrainian air shield must continuously have all it needs – President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-02</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! A summary of the day. The first thing was to hold the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff meeting. Urgent security issues. An obviously harsh response to the death of people in Kyiv due to a closed shelter. I gave instructions for having the shelter facilities in Kyiv and throughout the country inspected. Ministers Kamyshin and Klymenko are in charge of this. Unfortunately, even today – after everything has happened – Kyiv residents repeatedly post information about the lack of access to shelters. Not just about closed shelters but about brewed entrances to shelters, about the absence of shelters at all in some parts of the city. This level of negligence in the city cannot be covered with any excuses. All the details regarding our air defense system – its further development, supply, and production of the necessary missiles in Ukraine were also discussed at the Staff meeting. The Ukrainian air shield must continuously have all it needs. We are engaged in the coalition of Patriot systems and the coalition of modern fighters – actively every day. The situation on the front line was discussed carefully in detail, in all those points where it is the toughest situation now. I will not talk about it in more detail – the actions of our state, the active actions of our troops will say what is needed. And I separately held a meeting devoted to the training of our new brigades, those that are accumulating strength from the north to the south of our country. The second item for today – negotiations with the President of Estonia, who arrived in Kyiv. Security comes first, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s about our defense now, and what&#x27;s about our long-term security. Estonia fundamentally helps us with weapons and equipment, supports our movement in NATO, it is aware of how crucial it is that we prevail over ruscism right now and on our Ukrainian land. It is crucial for every nation neighboring a terrorist state. I&#x27;m sure we will provide this security, which is so necessary, we will provide victory over Russian aggression to Ukraine, all of Europe and the free world. It is also noteworthy that we are developing our cooperation with Estonia and the export of solutions – our digital solutions. Earlier, it was from Estonia that Ukrainians took an example in the development of digital solutions. And now, we have reached such a level that on the basis of our Ukrainian Diia a government application will be created in Estonia. What is convenient and useful for millions of Ukrainians will obviously be convenient and useful for other nations. And it is another component of our leadership, Ukrainian leadership. We discussed further cooperation with Mr. President of Estonia, in particular, in digitalization. And, by the way, I will make the following announcement: Diia will help develop government services in other countries, not only in Europe – in Latin America and Africa. The third for today from the various activities worth saying. I held several meetings, long and meaningful, regarding shaping our comprehensive policy for the future. The things that concern the further transformation of the state. The things that concern our participation in global processes. As always, we are preparing news and solutions that will give Ukraine and Ukrainians even more strength. I&#x27;m thankful to everyone who helps our country! Glory to all our warriors! To everyone who is currently fighting for Ukraine. Today, I especially want to mention the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade – all the soldiers of this brigade, who are is extremely resistant in defending the Svatove direction and successfully repelling enemy attacks while moving forward. Thank you, warriors! Avdiyivka direction... 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade – thank you, soldiers, for your bravery and your ability to be strong in destroying the invaders. Well done! I would like to mention the border guards who proudly defend the state on the front lines together with all our defense and security forces. Lviv, Donetsk, Zhytomyr border guard units fighting at the front. Thank you! And I also thank the soldiers of the Chernihiv border detachment, who are actively opposing the Shahed drones. The speed and accuracy of our soldiers are critical. Thank you, warriors, for your speed and for your accuracy! Today, I signed the decrees on honoring our soldiers with state awards. A total of 263 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Please don&#x27;t forget to thank our warriors in person – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-03</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Almost every evening, in my addresses, I thank our warriors – particular units, particular brigades, which distinguished themselves the most on the front line or in the defense of our sky in a day or in a week. And today – more personal words of gratitude to particular warriors. We should all remember that our defense, our active actions, and the independence of Ukraine are not something abstract. These are very particular people, particular actions of particular heroes, thanks to which Ukraine exists and Ukraine will exist. Thousands and thousands of our strongest, bravest, most accurate people... Such as soldier Yaroslav Kan, our paratrooper. He fought in the most fiercely embattled spots of the front. Bilohorivka, defense of Lysychansk, defense of Soledar. Battles for Svatove, Kreminna, Bakhmut... Four wounds! Now, he is undergoing treatment, recovering. And ready to return to the front again. It is an extraordinary human power! Thank you, Yaroslav! Senior Sergeant Yevhen Kepsha, commander of the squad of the anti-tank missile systems platoon. Battles for Bakhmut. Stugna anti-tank guided missile system. Very accurate, very brave. Together with the boys, together with the brothers from his squad have very good results in destroying the occupiers. Thanks for this, Yevhen! Senior Sergeant Maksym Kuzmenko and Junior Sergeant Anton Andrushchenko are soldiers of the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade. Battles near Avdiyivka. Very tough fights. Continuous enemy assaults. And this is the result Ukraine needs in defense of our positions. Thank you, guys! I have already thanked our soldiers from the 55th Zaporizhzhia Sich Artillery Brigade many times. All guys are great. They fight mightily, very efficiently. And today, I will especially mention the artillery company under the command of Captain Mykola Nosach. Avdiyivka direction. They fight off Russian assaults very skillfully. Exactly what is needed. Thank you, Mykola! It&#x27;s great to see reports of your accuracy. Soldiers of our 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade Zakarpattia. Battalion commander Lt. Col. Oleksandr Hladysh, company commander Captain Rostyslav Kmet, platoon commander Senior Lieutenant Oleksandr Shytikov, gun commander Junior Sergeant Oleksandr Kryshtapiuk, senior gunner Senior Soldier Yaroslav Niul... Artillery calculations. Always effective. Thank you, warriors! Our glorious 35th Marine Infantry Brigade named after Rear-Admiral Mykhailo Ostrogradsky... The guys deserve gratitude for almost every day of fighting. And today, I want to note separately the entire 1st battalion of marines of the brigade. I&#x27;m thankful to each of you guys! Your strength is an example to all. And the defenders of our sky. Such as soldier Anatoliy Pavlenko, national guard. The Bureviy anti-aircraft missile battalion. A guy who knows how to shoot down Russian missiles extremely well – and with the help of just an Igla MANPADS. Thank you for this accuracy! We usually thank the warriors who defend our cities from Russian terror with the help of powerful air defense systems: Patriot, NASAMS, IRIS, and others. And it is absolutely fair – they saved a lot of lives of our people, a lot of infrastructure facilities. However, soldiers of our fire maneuver groups, which defend various civilian and military facilities, are important – and effective! As, for example, Senior Sergeant Viktor Sidnev is the senior of one of these maneuver groups defending Kyiv. Excellent coordination of actions, excellent combat skills. And there is a result – down the invaders&#x27; missiles. Thank you! Thank you to everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is on combat posts and on combat missions! Thank you to everyone who constantly trains our soldiers and everyone who provides treatment to our heroes after their injuries! And I am asking you all: please don&#x27;t forget to thank our warriors in person. Thank those whom you know personally. Thank those whom you may simply follow in social networks. Thank those whom you just heard about – and can tell other people about them. Gratitude is always important, and it&#x27;s important to hear words of gratitude when you fight for your people like this. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The time will come when children on Earth, including those in Ukraine, will be protected from such evil as Russian - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-04</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! The rescue operation in the town of Pidhorodne, Dnipro region, where a Russian missile destroyed houses, has already been completed. 25 people were injured, five of them children. Davyd, who is 6 years old, is in serious condition and hospitalized. Denys, 11, is also in serious condition and hospitalized. Oleksandr, 15, is also in serious condition. Liza, 17 years old, is undergoing outpatient treatment. Kira, 10 years old, has a mine-blast injury, she is undergoing outpatient treatment. It is painful to see such reports. Liza, a 2-year-old girl, was killed by this Russian missile. Probably an Iskander missile. My condolences to the family and friends... The Russian terror has claimed the lives of hundreds of our children, and only since February 24, during the full-scale war, we know for sure that 485 children have been killed. This is a number that we can officially confirm, knowing the data of each child. Unfortunately, the real number is higher. Every time we liberate our land from the Russian occupiers, we learn the terrible truth about the occupation. About how many people, how many children are buried in the occupied territory - in the graves of this war, this aggression. And how many more are still under the ruins in Ukrainian cities and villages burned by Russia. So far, unfortunately, we do not have complete information about the hundreds of thousands of children who were deported to Russia. As of today, thanks to various efforts, 371 children have been returned to Ukraine from deportation. At the same time, we know for sure about at least 19,505 deported Ukrainian children, and this is only a part of all our little Ukrainians who are still in the hands of the enemy. We must return them all. Today in our country is the day of remembrance for children who died as a result of Russian aggression. Since 2014. Children who would have been alive if a bunch of thugs in the Kremlin, in Moscow, hadn&#x27;t considered themselves chieftains who allegedly had the right to decide the fate of nations. Each of these bandits will be convicted. I have no doubt about it. All the necessary legal institutions are working for this result. And today, on this day of remembrance, I want to thank everyone in the world who supports our efforts for justice. For the sake of punishing everyone who brought terror to our land, everyone who kills and deports children and adults. I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps the work of the International Criminal Court and its team in investigating Russian crimes on Ukrainian soil. And who helps us organize a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine - for the original crime that gave rise to all the other terrible crimes of this war. Let the verdicts against the ruscists that they will one day hear in the dock - lawful and just verdicts - be evidence that the world will still protect life, protect civilization. And that the time will come when children on Earth - in Ukraine and elsewhere - will be protected from such evil as Russian evil and from such aggressions. That is why it is so important that the power of justice, the power of accountability, be a powerful reminder of every life that was taken by evil, by Russia. And today part of this accountability - a mandatory part - is sanctions. Sanctions from the world that make Russia pay the price for what it is doing. Sanctions that should limit Russia&#x27;s capacity for terror to the maximum. Today I held a special meeting on sanctions. The Main Intelligence Directorate, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Government, the Office. We analyzed in great detail how Russia circumvents sanctions and who helps it. Different countries, different companies, without which Russia would not be able to produce terrorist weapons, including missiles. Unfortunately, the terrorist state manages to use the technologies of the world through a network of suppliers, and manages to circumvent international sanctions regimes. We see every direction of circumvention of existing sanctions, every country whose territory or jurisdiction, whose citizens are used by Russia to continue terror. And we must close all such areas - together with our partners - to ensure that Russian missiles and weapons do not contain products of the free world. The necessary steps will be taken. Thank you to everyone who helps us fight the evil of aggression! Glory to all our warriors! And thank you for this day on the frontline. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The enemy knows that Ukraine will win – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-05</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on the day. First of all, I am grateful to each of our warriors, to all our defenders who gave us the news we expect. Bakhmut direction – well done, warriors! We see how hysterically Russia perceives every step we take there, every position we take. The enemy knows that Ukraine will win. They see it. They feel it thanks to your strikes, soldiers, and in particular in Donetsk region. Thank you for that! Today, I would like to particularly celebrate several combat units of ours. These are the 5th separate assault brigade and the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade, which skillfully, decisively and efficiently defend our positions, destroying the occupiers and, most importantly, moving forward. Thank you, warriors! Thank you all! Second, we continue our work on sanctions against Russia. Although the global trend is clear – Russia will lose this war, Russia&#x27;s rulers continue to deny reality. They continue to try to deceive the world, to circumvent sanctions, to produce more weapons, to ensure more resources and people are spent on this aggression. We are preparing our steps, new steps to further limit Russia&#x27;s military potential. Everyone in the world who helps the terrorist state circumvent sanctions in one way or another, everyone in the world whom Russia uses for the supply of weapons, components, equipment – each such entity must feel the full force of the free world. And we will ensure this. It is a common task of the world to stop terror. And the main prerequisite for fulfilling this task is to stop any ways in which terrorists are still trying to get something for themselves. More news to come soon. Third. Today I held a long and very informative meeting on the transformation of our country and our lives – now and after the victory. Objectively, there are fundamental security, economic, energy, technological, and simply human issues that require full and effective answers. These answers will determine what Ukraine will be like and what life will be like for Ukrainian children when they become adults and inherit the state from the current generations. A strong state, a free state, a modern state, a state pleasant to live in. We are laying the foundation for this now. Everyone who fights for Ukraine. Everyone who works for Ukraine. Everyone who helps. For example, today the government, the Office, and the National Security and Defense Council discussed the energy sector and agricultural production in a broad sense. Not only restoring what Ukraine had, but developing and expanding it, taking into account Ukraine&#x27;s global role for the food and energy security of Europe and the world. We will present all these details. It will be thorough. In particular, we will present them at the London International Conference on the Reconstruction of Ukraine, which will take place this month. And, of course, we do not stop our international work with partners for a single day. Today the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was in Kyiv. A good meeting, useful negotiations and a new strengthening of our countries and our security. I thanked for all the defense support provided to Ukraine, and especially for the Storm Shadow missiles, which have proven to be extremely effective on the frontline. We continued the conversation about a new coalition to protect life – the Patriot Coalition. Step by step, we are moving with our partners to make this coalition as effective in protecting life and freedom as all our other defense coalitions that have already been established. We also talked with Mr. Secretary of State about preparations for the NATO Summit in Vilnius. The Summit must be meaningful. Then it will become historic. Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is bringing the defeat of Russian terror closer! Glory to our warriors! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This year in Vilnius, it is necessary to finally establish that Ukraine will be a member of NATO – address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Bucharest Nine Summit</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-06</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much, dear colleagues! First of all, I would like to thank you, dear Zuzana, Klaus, Andrzej, for the invitation. Jens, Mr. Secretary General! And dear participants! Today, Russian terrorists have once again proved that they are a threat to everything living. Last night they blew up the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, at 2:50 am this explosion happened. It was an absolutely deliberate, prepared explosion. They knew exactly what they were doing. Just imagine the volume of water held by this dam. It was one of the largest reservoirs in Ukraine. The flooding of the southern regions of our country has been ongoing since this night. At least 100 thousand people lived in these areas before the Russian invasion. At least tens of thousands are still there. 80 towns and villages are under water. Evacuation has already begun. And these are just the initial consequences. Unfortunately, the tragedy is much broader. The Kakhovka reservoir was a source of drinking water for millions of people. Now, instead of a water supply system, there is only a water truck. Imagine that for cities with tens or hundreds of thousands of people. The Kakhovka reservoir was a source of water for farming and agricultural production. Huge areas are now without irrigation. And now it is even difficult to determine what the consequences for the environment will be... Russia has detonated a bomb of mass environmental destruction. And this is a real ecocide! Of course, all our services, all those who can rescue people, are already involved. But only on the territory controlled by Ukraine. Unfortunately, Russia has been controlling this dam and the entire Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant for more than a year. And it is physically impossible to blow it up somehow from the outside, by shelling. It was mined. It was mined by the Russian occupiers. And they blew it up. And this once again demonstrates the cynicism with which Russia treats the people whose land it has captured, and what Russia actually brings to Europe and the world. This is the largest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades. And it is the most dangerous terrorist in the world. And that is why Russia&#x27;s defeat – a defeat that we will ensure anyway – will be the most significant contribution to the security of our region, our Europe and the entire world. Dear ladies and gentlemen! Of course, we will mobilize all possible support now, after such a Russian attack on people and nature. And I am grateful to all the leaders, states, and international organizations that have already condemned this Russian terrorist attack. And we have called for the UN Security Council to be convened and we will reach out to everyone who is able to bring Russia to legal and fair accountability for this terror. But to truly guarantee security, we need more than that. As long as the terrorist state still hopes to recoup somehow, as long as Russia still knows that doubts and fears remain somewhere here in Europe, we are all in danger. Because security is always a certainty, and it is always a foregone conclusion that those who encroach on security will lose. We are moving on the ground, liberating our people from the Russian occupation. We are creating an air shield that protects lives from attacks by Russian missiles and Iranian drones. We are creating the coalition of Patriots to show everyone, all potential aggressors in the world, that free nations have effective weapons to defend themselves against any missile. We are also creating a new coalition of fighter jets that will protect our people from Russian guided bombs and other forms of Russian aviation terror. I am confident that we will find a way to counter Russia&#x27;s environmental terror as well. However, don&#x27;t we know what constantly fuels Russian revanchism? What motivates Moscow to try to take control of this or that part of Europe through terror, disasters, corruption, and blackmail? We know this for sure. This is the belief of Russia&#x27;s rulers that Europe will allegedly show weakness. Weakness is the main hope and bet of terrorists. Unfortunately, for years, security uncertainty has persisted in Europe – to whom NATO&#x27;s doors are actually open. Are they open to all free nations? At this year&#x27;s NATO Summit in Vilnius, it is time to show that NATO&#x27;s declared values and real values do not differ. It is time to show that there will be no weakness in Europe. How many more disasters will it take for a terrorist state to finally see that terror is not a tool to influence NATO&#x27;s decisions? And that&#x27;s why Russia needs these disasters – the Kremlin wants to constrain us with them, and constrain you all. I am grateful to you, dear leaders, I am grateful to you, Jens, for standing up to this. Your rhetoric and actions are exactly what all our allies and partners need. This is what is needed to protect against terror and disasters. To defend against Russia. I thank all of you who help us fight against the Russian occupiers. I thank all of you who help us increase the world&#x27;s pressure on Russia for its terror. I thank all of you who help prepare the real content for this year&#x27;s NATO Summit. It is necessary to finally establish that Ukraine will be a member of NATO, and this can only be established by an invitation to Ukraine to join. Finally, it is necessary to determine the algorithm of when and as a result of what steps such accession will take place. Finally, security guarantees for Ukraine on its way to NATO should be formalized. When this happens, it will immediately deprive Russian revanchism of its purpose. Those who destroy must be destroyed themselves. Terror must lose. And we have to ensure that with every step we take, every choice we make, and every summit we organize. Thank you again, Zuzana! Thank you all, colleagues, for the invitation. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The disaster at the Kakhovka HPP caused by Russian terrorists will not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-06</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! This day, which began with an urgent meeting of the National Security and Defense Council, continued with a meeting of the Staff. We are waiting for a meeting of the UN Security Council. The disaster at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant caused by Russian terrorists will not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians. We will still liberate all our land. And each Russian act of terrorism increases only the amount of reparations that Russia will pay for its crimes, not the chances of the occupiers to stay on our land. First of all, I am grateful to all our rescuers, military, representatives of local communities, each of our regions, who are now helping people from our southern regions flooded by the Russian terrorist attack. Second, the government at all levels is doing everything to save people and provide drinking water to those who received it from the Kakhovka reservoir. Kryvyi Rih and the entire Dnipropetrovsk region, cities and villages in Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions – no matter how difficult it is, we have to help people. Third, I am grateful to everyone who is currently evacuating people from the towns and villages flooded by water from the Kakhovka reservoir. It is very important now to take care of each other and help as much as possible. Fourth, the whole world will know about this Russian war crime, the crime of ecocide. This deliberate destruction of the dam and other HPP facilities by the Russian occupiers is an environmental bomb of mass destruction. For the sake of their own security, the world should now show that Russia will not get away with such terror. And I am grateful to all leaders and states, all nations and international organizations that have supported Ukraine and are ready to help our people and our de-occupation efforts. The Prosecutor General has already appealed to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to involve international justice in the investigation of the dam explosion. Today I spoke with IAEA Director Grossi, in particular about what happened to the Kakhovka reservoir and the general situation with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. I called on the IAEA Director to directly and unequivocally condemn today&#x27;s Russian act of terrorism and to maximize our efforts to liberate the ZNPP. We agreed on his visit to Ukraine. Fifth, it is only the complete liberation of Ukrainian land from Russian occupiers that will guarantee that such acts of terrorism will not happen again. Russia uses anything for terror – any object. The terrorist state must lose. I want to say a few more things separately. Regarding our south and Crimea. We will find a way to restore normal life on our land after the expulsion of the ruscists. This applies to water and everything else. This applies to all our regions – from Kherson to Dnipropetrovsk, from Mykolaiv to Crimea. The fact that Russia deliberately destroyed the Kakhovka reservoir, which is critically important, in particular, for providing water to Crimea, indicates that the Russian occupiers have already realized that they will have to flee Crimea as well. Well, Ukraine will get back everything that belongs to it. And it will make Russia pay for what it has done. Glory to all our people who are fighting and working for the sake of our country and our people! Today, just like yesterday, I would like to celebrate our heroes in the Bakhmut sector... Well done, warriors! The 3rd separate assault brigade and the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade - thank you! Thank you for moving forward! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>An immediate and maximum global response to Russian terror is needed – address by Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the Russian ecocide caused by the blasting of the Kakhovka HPP</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-06</span></div>
  <p>I address everyone in the world for whom life is a value. Today the Russian occupiers have committed the biggest crime of ecocide on the Ukrainian land – not only during this war, but in decades. In fact, the destroyed Kakhovka reservoir is one of the largest in Ukraine. It holds 18 billion cubic meters of water. All the structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and its dam were located in the occupied territory. Under the full control of the Russian occupiers. Last fall, we had information that the occupiers had mined the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. They did it intentionally. First, to blackmail the world. Second, to blow up the dam and use the flood as a weapon. This is exactly what happened. The flood zone includes areas where more than a hundred thousand people lived before the war. Now, at least tens of thousands of people remain there. The Kakhovka reservoir provided drinking water to a huge part of Ukraine – cities and villages with hundreds of thousands of people. It also supplied water to farmers for agricultural production in the south and center of Ukraine. Moreover, the destruction of the dam and the reservoir is a man-made strike on the environment, after which nature will have to recover for decades. Evacuation of people from the flooded area is ongoing – almost eighty settlements are under threat. An oil slick of at least 150 tons formed and was taken by the current to the Black Sea. We cannot yet predict how much of the chemicals, fertilizers and oil products stored in the flooded areas will end up in the rivers and sea. As of today, several things are clear. First, such a crime of ecocide could not have happened simply by shelling the dam. To destroy it, Russian forces had to act deliberately – mine, blow up, destroy. Secondly, no country in the world should be left alone against such terror, and I am grateful to everyone who is helping Ukraine! Thirdly, we need an immediate and maximum global response to Russian terror. From the UN Security Council to every international institution. Every state, every leader. Russian terrorists must leave our entire territory, every meter of which they are trying to use for evil and disasters. The faster the de-occupation happens, the faster the security will come. The deliberate destruction of the hydroelectric dam by terrorists looks the same from all corners of the world. For Africa, Europe, the United States, China, Australia, and India, man-made disasters are evil. We must stop the Russian evil. All other terrorists in the world must see that terror is punished by the world. Thank you to everyone who helps us to protect life! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>International organizations, such as the ICRC, must immediately join the rescue of people in the occupied part of Kherson region – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-07</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today, maximum attention is paid to the consequences of the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Dozens of settlements on the territory under our control have been flooded. Thousands of houses! Evacuation continues. Under fire! Russian artillery continues to fire, no matter what. Savages. But as of now, more than 2,000 people have been rescued in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. And I thank everyone involved in this work, everyone who helps! Our task is to protect lives and help people as much as possible. The situation in the occupied part of Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers simply abandoned people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just on the rooftops in flooded communities. And this is another deliberate crime of Russia: after the terrorist state has caused a disaster, it also maximizes the damage from it. Now we need a clear and quick response from the world to what is happening. It is even impossible to establish for sure how many people in the temporarily occupied territory of Kherson region may die without rescue, without drinking water, without food, without medical care. Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed. We need international organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. Each person who dies there is a verdict on the existing international architecture and international organizations that have forgotten how to save lives. If there is no international organization in the area of this disaster now, it means that it does not exist at all, that it is incapable of functioning. All the relevant appeals from Ukraine and our government are in place. Many world leaders, heads of state, governments, and interstate associations have expressed their support for Ukraine and clear condemnation of the Russian crime of ecocide. I am grateful for this principled approach! Together we must bring the occupiers to justice. They have controlled the dam and the entire hydroelectric power plant for more than a year. Russian propagandists were seriously and openly discussing this very scenario of a man-made disaster, which they caused. Last fall, we warned the world about Russia&#x27;s mining of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. We called for both sending an international observation mission to Kakhovka and demining the units and all the plant&#x27;s facilities. Unfortunately, the world&#x27;s attention was not enough to ensure all this. Now we must focus the world&#x27;s attention on eliminating the consequences of another catastrophe caused by Russia, and we must prevent further destructive activity of the occupiers. I had several important international conversations today. Turkish President Erdoğan. I briefed him on the situation in the flooded areas, our rescue operation and urgent needs to help people. Of course, we also discussed the risks to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which is still under the control of the occupiers. We have an agreement with the head of the IAEA to intensify the work of IAEA representatives at the plant. But it is clear that as long as the occupiers are there, there can be no complete security. Therefore, the de-occupation of Ukraine is a non-alternative task. French President Macron. We discussed in great detail all the consequences of the Russian act of terrorism at the plant and the overall situation. We discussed everything we can do to help people and the affected regions. We also thoroughly discussed defensive actions, as well as international measures that we are preparing in spite of everything, because we need security despite any aggressive and openly insane actions of Russia. Separately, I want to mention a few things that are important for our entire country, and especially for people in those regions of our country that depended on the Kakhovka reservoir. First. We will provide drinking water to everyone. In all regions, districts, cities and villages where it is necessary. All the necessary supply systems will be put in place where there is currently a delivery of drinking water. Sustainability of supply is the main principle. Second. The world will be with us. Our partners are fully informed about what is happening and what kind of help we need. Whatever the economic, social and environmental consequences of this disaster, all the basics of life will be preserved. Kherson, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro regions – we see all the problems and will do everything possible and impossible to solve the problems created by the occupiers. Third. The direct responsibility of state and local authorities in all affected communities and regions is to help people. From the Government and the State Emergency Service to regional authorities and local communities, everyone is involved to the maximum extent possible to save and protect as many people as possible. Everyone should take this task personally. And I am grateful to those who do! Let&#x27;s take care of each other and Ukraine! And, of course, today I thank each of our warriors, all units, all brigades that continue to fight the occupiers. The Bakhmut direction, Avdiivka, all of Khortytsia, all of Tavria – great job! No matter what, every day should be a day of destruction of the enemy. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to all who care about Ukraine and Ukrainians! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is necessary to consolidate the world for Russia to bear responsibility for ecocide and for Ukraine not to be left alone with this tragedy - President&#x27;s address to the representatives of the world environmental protection community</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-08</span></div>
  <p>Good evening! Greetings to all of you! All of you who did not remain indifferent when you saw this man-made disaster at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. This is not a natural disaster, not a manifestation of the climate crisis. This disaster is Putin. What he does. What he personally orders to do. The situation is extremely difficult. Russian troops do not stop artillery strikes at the very territory where people are being evacuated. Unfortunately, there are wounded from these terrorist attacks. People who are rescuing and evacuating from the Russian ecocide are also forced to flee from Russian fire! Right at the evacuation points... This Russian crime of ecocide is the largest in Europe in decades, but apparently, the Russian occupiers have decided to further aggravate its consequences. In the occupied part of the territory, where about a dozen settlements are flooded, no evacuation is carried out at all. People have been staying on rooftops, trapped in water for two days, without drinking water, without food or medical care. We do not know the number of dead and injured yet. Literally every hour we are establishing more and more details about the damage Russia has caused by this disaster. In more than thirty settlements, life is ruined. For hundreds of thousands of people in many towns and villages, access to drinking water has been greatly impeded. Due to the destruction of the dam, fuel storages, warehouses with chemicals, warehouses with fertilizers, animal burial grounds, including at least two &quot;anthrax burials&quot; - both in the temporarily occupied territory - were flooded. We do not know what happened to them now. Where there was no centralized sewage system, sewage is already in the water that covers everything... The number of ecosystems that have been destroyed or pushed to the brink of extinction by this Russian terrorist act is already measured in thousands. More than fifty thousand hectares of forests have been flooded, and at least half of them will die. Tens of thousands of birds and at least twenty thousand wild animals are at risk of death. Obviously, the Kakhovka reservoir has been turned into a large grave for millions of living beings. No nation should be left to face such challenges alone! But there is no answer yet to how we can overcome all this together. First. Of course, we will continue to do everything possible to save as many people as possible. And we need the world&#x27;s support in this. And not just with rhetoric, but with actions. International organizations have started to help on the territory we control. I am grateful. On the occupied territory, there is zero support. And the longer this goes on, the more victims there will be, unfortunately. There is virtually no attention of international organizations to the occupied territory, which is flooded. And we need, in particular, your pressure on them! Please! Second. All this we have faced is a deliberate crime of the occupier. There are many questions about what happened. But it happened in the occupied territory. But last year we warned about the occupiers mining the dam and other structures of the plant. But Russian troops are now shelling the areas where the evacuation is underway. Obviously, it is Russia that is interested in the disaster. Just as we have established special Expert Groups to promote sanctions and security guarantees for Ukraine, we are establishing an Expert Group that will primarily focus on consolidating the world so that Russia is fully responsible for the ecocide and so that our country is not left alone with this tragedy - the ecocide. I am sure that with sufficient leadership in the world, the appropriate tools can be created. Third. Any terrorist counts on only a few forms of results for himself: the suffering of people, the intimidation of people, and the ruins that terror leaves behind. This is exactly how Russia is acting in this case as well. Of course, we will do everything to guarantee people a basis for life even after this disaster. But we need to make sure that there is not a single desert or ruin or dead zone left after this disaster. And this can only be ensured by joint efforts, together with the global environmental protection community, together with policy makers, together with leaders and states, together with international organizations. Pollution and poison from the flooded area quickly gets into the groundwater, poisons the rivers, and from there it enters the Black Sea basin. That is, there is no destruction of nature &quot;somewhere out there&quot; – everything in the world is very interconnected. So please spread the truth about this Russian ecocide. Please urge leaders, states and international organizations to act. It is no coincidence that one of the key points in our proposed Peace Formula is to combat ecocide. Please, let&#x27;s work together to make sure that there are no more ecocides. Join our community, which I mentioned, our platform, our specialists. We are in constant touch. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia is ruled by savages who themselves are the biggest disaster on the planet - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-08</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very long, hard day. Kherson and the region, Mykolaiv region, cities and communities of our Dnipropetrovsk region. Conversations, meetings, evacuation centers, an international appeal. First. We are working at all levels of state and local authorities to rescue as many people as possible from the flooded areas. The evacuation is ongoing. Wherever we can get people out of the flood zone, we do so. The State Emergency Service, police and military are doing a great job! I want to thank each and every one of you who are involved! Second. There is a presence of international organizations on our free territory, and concrete assistance. In particular, it is the Ukrainian Red Cross and many others. I am grateful to every organization, every volunteer, every company that has really joined the rescue operation. And it is obvious that the absence of some international organizations, such as the International Red Cross, in the disaster zone in the occupied territory, the absence of their assistance to our people in the occupied territory is wrong and is simply self-destruction for such organizations to my mind. Third. Russian terrorists are trying to further aggravate the situation they have caused with their ecocide. This is absolutely deliberate. They continue to shell Kherson and the communities of the region, which have already been flooded by terrorists. They are even shelling evacuation points, which is a manifestation of evil that perhaps no terrorists in the world, except for Russian ones, have ever done. The occupiers have completely abandoned people on the left bank of Kherson region to their fate. The catastrophe has been expanding there for two days now. And this is also an absolutely conscious choice of the Russian leadership. There is no one left in the world today who does not see that Russia is ruled by savages. Savages who themselves are the biggest disaster on the planet today. Together with our partners, we must do everything for the world to prove that it can cope with such disasters, with such terrorists. The situation with drinking water in our cities and communities. Leaders on the ground and in the government know the drill. We have solutions, resources and funds. We will do everything to provide people with drinking water despite this disaster. There may be inconvenience, but we will do everything. Today, I held a separate meeting on water supply and safety of people in the cities and communities of Dnipropetrovsk region - I was there personally. Kryvyi Rih, Marhanets, Nikopol, Pokrov and other communities - we talked about it. The situation with infrastructure and environmental damage. The damage caused by the Russian act of terrorism is very significant, this is clear to everyone. But it should also be clear that there are no alternatives other than maximum recovery and maximum reconstruction. It may be Russia that will be left devastated after Putin, but not Ukraine. And one more thing. Mandatory. Security. I am in constant communication with our military. The commanders of Khortytsia, Tavria, all those involved in the hottest areas. Donetsk region - very tough battles. But there is a result, and I am grateful to everyone who ensures this result! Bakhmut - well done. Step by step. I thank each of our warriors! Avdiivka, Maryinka, the entire east, the situation in the south, the situation after the Russians blew up the dam of our native Kakhovka - we see every detail. But it&#x27;s not time to talk about it today. Thank you to our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We see heroism of our soldiers and are grateful for every minute of their life, which is the life of Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-09</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I just held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The situation on the front line is the main focus. Reports from commanders of task forces, the Commander-in-Chief, Defense Intelligence, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Strategic Industries, Ministry of Internal Affairs. We focus our attention on all directions where our actions are needed and where the enemy may suffer certain defeats. Our defensive actions, active actions, our gains on the front lines. We discussed in detail the supply and distribution of ammunition, the strengthening of our artillery, and anti-aircraft defense. I spoke today with the Prime Ministers of Japan and the Netherlands. I briefed them on our rescue operation in the southern regions, about our urgent needs. There is a willingness to help Ukraine, and I am grateful to the partners for this. There are decisions regarding humanitarian support packages. With the Prime Minister of Japan, we discussed preparations for the Global Peace Summit and a conference in Japan on the reconstruction and transformation of our country after hostilities. We talked with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands about our further defense cooperation, coordinated our positions before the next Ramstein meeting. We are moving step by step in strengthening our air shield. We discussed the coalition of Patriot systems, the training of our pilots. Today, there is a very important decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands regarding the Scythian gold collection. The Ukrainian collection. The collection kept in our Crimea, but which cannot yet be returned to Crimea for an obvious reason: it cannot be given to the occupier, the robber. Of course, it will be in Crimea, when the Ukrainian flag will also be in Crimea. Actually, the highest court of the Netherlands confirmed this logic. And this is another proof that the Dutch people, the Dutch society and the state really know how to be leaders in defending the rule of law and the values of civilization. I thank everyone who fought for this decision, our team at the Ministry of Justice that worked for this result. We will protect justice step by step. Today, there is also a new security support package from the United States for over $2 billion. Missiles for Patriots and other air defense systems, strengthening our defenses on the ground, enhancing the strength of all our soldiers. Thank you, Mr. President Biden, thank you to both parties of Congress and to all Americans who want freedom to win as much as Ukrainians do. Of course, during the day I receive reports about the rescue operation in Kherson region and Mykolaiv region, about the state of the Kakhovka reservoir – in fact, its remains. An enormous amount of challenges. But we are working to overcome them at all possible levels. And the main thing is that now there is a public potential to do it. Caring for each other, working in unity, protecting people and life. These are our principles, the principles of struggling Ukraine. They, our principles, are now 100 percent effective. And I am sure: no matter how difficult it may be, we will overcome the consequences of this disaster and all Russian evil. I thank everyone in the world who is already helping and who is asking Ukraine how to help. I&#x27;m thankful to everyone who is already participating in the rescue operation, who is helping people as best they can. Help people, animals, all living things. I also thank all those who encourage international organizations, foreign leaders, and other states to see what happened and call things by their names. Russian terrorists must be held accountable for everything they have done. And separately – for our soldiers, for all those who are in particularly tough battles these days. We see your heroism, and we are grateful to you for every minute of your life – a life that is truly the life of Ukraine. Because Ukraine is as free as you, our soldiers, are strong. Ukraine is defended as much as you, our soldiers, are effective. Everyone who is fighting now is a fighting Ukraine. Thank you for this! Glory to all who fight and work for our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukrainian sense of international relations is that we should always take care of each other – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-10</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! A summary of this day. The first is negotiations with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. Weapons and ammunition. There is a defense package, in particular, the important 155mm. The coalition of modern fighters and the training of our pilots have the visible progress. The movement towards NATO – in this regard, there is also a result today. I am personally grateful to the Prime Minister and to all Canadians for their unwavering and unequivocal support for our freedom. The consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovka HPP were discussed in detail. Canada is among those who can help us recover from this disaster. We understand each other in the steps that are needed. And they are needed very quickly. Of course, we will not stay away from the disaster Canada is facing now. Massive wildfires, colossal environmental losses, and threats to people... Ukraine is ready to help extinguish fires if Canada needs such international assistance. Our Ukrainian sense of international relations is precisely in the fact that we should always take care of each other when support is needed. And really help. I am sure it will become global principles. Mutual action, mutual support, mutual strength. Now, unfortunately, we see that at some levels in the world, there is simply a shameful indifference to the ecocide and human tragedy caused by the Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovka HPP. When international organizations that are supposed to protect life on a global scale do not have time to organize and send a rescue mission to the occupied territory even in a week when some world players do not dare to come out even with clear and strong statements that would condemn this new Russian war crime, terrorists are simply fueled by this weakness of the world, this indifference – it encourages them. And we have to overcome this. And we will overcome. We are pressing and encouraging so that international organizations and international support come to the part of Kherson region where the occupiers are now. As of now, over 3,000 people have already been evacuated in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. But again, it is only a free territory under our control. In the occupied territory, it is only possible to help people in some areas – Russian terrorists are doing everything to make the victims of the disaster as many as possible. Russian shelling continues – even at evacuation points. Russia does not provide any real help to the people in the flooded areas – not for the sake of propaganda, but for the sake of the people... The Russian state and the Russian leadership should bear separate, fair and strict responsibility for all this. And international organizations should operate in our areas, which we have not yet de-occupied. Every life is important – all of Kherson region, all of the south. Every city and village. We will do everything possible and impossible so that help comes to all our people. I thank each of our rescuers, military and police, local communities, and international organizations currently operating in Kherson region and Mykolaiv region, all our volunteers – each and every one who helps save people, animals, and life in general in the disaster zone... I thank the journalists, who spread the truth and tell the world the stories of people who have suffered. I&#x27;m thankful to everyone who helps people after the strikes of Russian missiles and Iranian Shahed drones. Odesa... My condolences to the relatives of those whose lives were taken last night by Russian terror... More than 20 were wounded. Everyone gets help. As every day, thanks go to our soldiers. To everyone who is on the front line, in positions, at combat posts, and on combat missions. Who destroys the enemy on land and protects our sky. I thank everyone who is taking a stand and who is moving forward. Khortytsia, Tavria – thank you to each of our heroes! Every effort to quickly restore peace to our entire state, every city, every village, every corner of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is very important that representatives of international justice have seen with their own eyes the consequences of the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-11</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today we managed to return 95 more of our people from Russian captivity, 31 of them are defenders of Mariupol. Most of them are privates and sergeants, two officers. The Armed Forces, the National Guard, the border guards. I am grateful to our team involved in the exchanges: Budanov, Yermak, Malyuk, Lubinets. Thank you for this result. Well done, guys! We have to get every Ukrainian man and woman out of Russian captivity. We are also continuing our rescue operation in the south of Ukraine, and we have managed to evacuate about 4,000 people. Dozens of towns and villages remain flooded, with the worst situation still in the temporarily occupied part of Kherson region. Again and again, we thank our people: the military, police, and rescuers. I would also like to thank volunteers, doctors, local authorities - everyone who is helping to rescue people after the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant disaster, and especially those who are helping to get people out, including those from the occupied territories. It is extremely difficult and dangerous, and it is a special kind of heroism. Thank you for every life saved! Russian terrorists continue to shell evacuation routes, evacuation points, boats that take people away... Today, as a result of one of these attacks, three people were killed, my condolences to their families and friends... Ten more people were injured, including two police officers. It was an evacuation from Kardashynka, a village on the left bank of Kherson region... The occupiers created this disaster by blowing up a dam, leaving people to their fate in flooded towns and villages, and then shelling the boats that are trying to take people away... Even beasts are more moral than you, Russian state. These days, representatives of the International Criminal Court visited Kherson region. On the very first day after the disaster, the Prosecutor General sent a request to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to investigate the disaster, and the work has already begun. It is very important that the representatives of international justice have seen the consequences of this Russian act of terrorism with their own eyes and heard for themselves that Russian terror continues. And it continues with the most cynical and brutal shelling of the flooded territory, the evacuation area... We are already facilitating and will continue to facilitate the most independent and objective investigation by the International Criminal Court. All our law enforcement and other institutions are involved in this process to the fullest extent possible. We provide full access to the affected areas, to witnesses, to all information and evidence. This investigation is very important for the security of the whole world. Full and fair accountability for Russian terrorists and the terrorist state itself is a prerequisite for preventing such evil from happening again in the world. Today, our state has taken another sanctions step. Against those who serve the evil that the Russian state has become. Against those who helped to destroy freedom in Russia and play a key role in the repressions on the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine and in Russia itself. 178 of these individuals were added to our sanctions lists at the request of the Security Service of Ukraine. And we will do everything to make sure that each and every one of these accomplices of the Russian dictatorship is held accountable for everything they have done against people and freedom. For every broken destiny and every criminal decision that helped Russia turn into a terrorist state. And one more thing. Of course, I am grateful to our warriors for this day. To each of our combat brigades, each of our units. The Khortytsia and Tavria operational and strategic groups of troops - all those who are now in combat, all those who are in positions, all those who are helping... I thank you! Thank you for every step, for every battle, for every destroyed occupier! Glory to our heroes! Glory to all who defend the life of Ukraine and Ukrainians! We will win! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The strength of our warriors yields results, and I thank everyone who is now in combat for this - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-12</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff today. The key reports were from the commanders of the operational directions that are the most important and hottest - Khortytsia and Tavria. The battles are fierce, but we are moving forward, and this is very important. The enemy&#x27;s losses are exactly what we need. Although the weather is unfavorable these days - the rains make our task more difficult - the strength of our warriors still yields results, and I thank everyone who is in combat now, everyone who supports our combat brigades in the relevant areas. Generals Syrskyi and Tarnavskyi reported today on the successes we have already achieved, on the points of the front where we need reinforcement, and on the actions that can break more Russian positions. Thank you to our guys for every Ukrainian flag that is now returning to its rightful place in the villages of the newly de-occupied territory! Thank you also for the significant replenishment of our exchange fund! There was a report from the Commander-in-Chief on the general situation, and from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Security Service of Ukraine on stabilization measures in the de-occupied territory. We are working very actively to supply the necessary weapons and ammunition. There was also an intelligence report on the enemy&#x27;s options. We are maintaining and strengthening our operational dominance. I am particularly grateful for Bakhmut as we are increasing our control in this area. Today&#x27;s meeting also included a final report on the readiness and non-readiness of shelters across the country, in major cities and in Kyiv. Ministers Klymenko, Kamyshin and Kubrakov reported. The results are disappointing, to say the least. On Friday, relevant draft decisions will be prepared - both on those responsible and on ensuring an adequate level of protection for our people in all Ukrainian cities. I also held several meetings on our international activities. This week, as always, will be very meaningful. First, we are preparing new weapons support from our partners for our warriors. Second, we are preparing to involve more global actors in the implementation of the Peace Formula. Third, we are working to make the Vilnius Summit truly meaningful. I&#x27;ll let you know every detail. And one more decision worth mentioning. The title of Hero of Ukraine has been posthumously awarded to Lieutenant Colonel of the Security Service of Ukraine Vasyl Bohach. For extraordinary personal bravery, for repeatedly detaining and eliminating enemy saboteurs. For the defense of Mariupol and for such heroism and self-sacrifice, which leave no other option for Ukraine and Ukrainians but victory. Glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to each and every one who is now in combat, at combat posts and on combat missions! We are moving forward step by step! We believe in victory. It will come! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Together with our partners, we must ensure such physical conditions that make Russian terror impossible - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-13</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! This afternoon, the rescue and rubble removal operations in Kryvyi Rih after a terrorist missile attack have been completed. Unfortunately, 11 people were killed, including one child... My condolences to the families and friends. In total, more than 30 people were injured. All of them are being provided with the necessary assistance. I would like to thank each and every person who took part in the rescue operation: rescuers, doctors, police, volunteers, local authorities, and ordinary citizens. Thank you for every life saved! Thank you for every person you helped today. This deliberate Russian strike on an ordinary city only proves a simple truth once again: together with our partners, we must ensure such physical conditions that make Russian terror impossible. The first is our sky shield. A sufficient number of air defense systems of sufficient capacity. Plus modern fighter jets. When the Russian ability to attack our cities and villages is physically limited by our sky shield, only then will the terrorist state realize that there are no alternatives to peace for all Ukrainians and defeat for Russia. The second is the destruction of the basis for terror, for the production of new missiles by a terrorist state. Unfortunately, Russia still has the ability to obtain critical components for missile production from companies around the world, including companies from some partner countries. These components are then shipped to Russia in various ways. If we take, for example, one of the missiles that hit Kryvyi Rih today, about 50 components in it - mostly microelectronics - were produced in other countries. And today, representatives of our state met with diplomats from the respective countries. All partners have a list of companies that supply Russia with components for murder. This list is available. Everyone in the world also understands how Russian terrorists are trying to deceive the world. And we are waiting for conclusions and swift action to stop Russian missile terror. Ukraine has imposed sanctions on all companies in Russia that produce missiles. Such complete sanctions should be imposed globally against all of them. Every way of circumventing sanctions should be appropriately punished at the global level as well. Export controls over critical components must be tightened as much as possible. If someone acts as an intermediary or works together with Russia so that terrorists can continue to blow up residential buildings and kill people, such entities - whether business or government - deserve a response from the world. A tough response. Our partners have all the information on this. It is definitely cheaper to cut terrorists off the supply of components for terror once and for all than to constantly spend more and more money on new air defense missiles. Today, we also held a meeting to ensure inevitable, legal and fair accountability of Russia for this aggression. We are working on several scenarios for creating a special tribunal for the crime of aggression. A crime for which the highest Russian leadership must be held accountable. The crime that gave rise to all other crimes of this war. And this accountability will surely come. Indeed, this is not an easy task. But Ukrainians have already accomplished so many difficult tasks that they will not only accomplish it for sure, but will do it with pleasure. There will be a tribunal. Today I met with IAEA Director General Grossi. We are working very actively to prevent any incidents at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP. As long as the invaders are there, there is a risk for the whole world, and this is obvious. Only complete de-occupation of the plant and its return to Ukrainian control can guarantee safety. And we will do everything for this. It&#x27;s good that the IAEA is offering to send a group of experts to Ukraine to assess the consequences of Russia&#x27;s destruction of the dam and other structures at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The world needs to know in detail what is happening and what crime against nature and people Russia has committed. I hope the IAEA experts will start working shortly. And of course, our warriors, our heroes. I thank all of you who are now in combat, who are protecting and advancing our positions. For example, the Bakhmut direction - and these are, in particular, the warriors of the 80th separate airborne assault brigade... There is advancement in different areas. I am grateful to you! Thank you for your extraordinary bravery! The units of the Tavria operational and strategic group of troops - despite extremely fierce fighting, despite the occupiers&#x27; air and artillery superiority, they are moving forward! Thank you, warriors! Thank you for every step and for every meter of Ukrainian land that is being liberated from Russian evil. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the 110th separate mechanized brigade, the 128th separate mountain assault brigade, paratroopers of our great &quot;Seventy-ninth&quot;, artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade &quot; Zaporizhzhia Sich &quot;. Thank you to all of you! Thank you for your strength! And I thank everyone in our society who understands that the liberation of our land from such occupiers requires hard, heroic and intensive actions that day after day, step by step, give the necessary power to our offensive! Glory to Ukrainian heroes! Glory to everyone in the world who helps! Today I thank the United States for another timely package of defense support. Artillery, armored vehicles, ammunition for our HIMARS. Thank you, America! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>When the ruins disappear, it is not just the aggressor who loses, but the very idea of aggression - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-14</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I have just spoken with President of Poland Andrzej Duda - an hour-long conversation, primarily on security issues. The current situation on the battlefield, weapons for our military, and ammunition. I thanked him for the fulfillment of previous defense agreements. Of course, in every conversation we pay considerable attention to long-term security and peace guarantees, and not only for us. And always effectively. Poland is quite realistic about the need for Ukraine&#x27;s membership in NATO. And this is an objective need. We are jointly developing a concrete content for the NATO Summit in Vilnius. This is exactly the moment when Russian assumptions that someone in NATO is still afraid of Russia must be completely shattered. Such assumptions fuel Russia&#x27;s aggressive ambitions. We must and can neutralize them. We thank Poland for its support for Ukraine and the real strengthening of NATO. Not only today, but throughout the week, we have been preparing very substantively for the Ukraine Recovery Conference to be held in London next week. This will be a significant event, very representative, which will unite both political and business efforts to restore our country and normal life for our people. The key Ukrainian principle is simple and fair, namely: no ruins will be left in Ukraine. We will rebuild everything, restore everything, and we know exactly what steps need to be taken in what timeframe and with what forces to defeat Russian aggression and rebuild our country. When the ruins disappear, it is not just the aggressor who loses, but the idea of aggression itself. And it will happen. Every day, in preparation for this London conference, we hold long and thorough preparatory meetings - all the necessary state institutions are involved, at different levels. And we are doing everything to ensure that the appropriate level of international agreements is prepared for our vision, the Ukrainian vision, which is, as always, meaningful. We continue our communication with partners on Russian missile production. Today, Russian savages launched another missile attack on Odesa with Kalibr missiles. Dozens of components of these Kalibr missiles were supplied to Russia from other countries. Obviously, each such supply route is a way to strengthen terror. The world has the tools to cut off all such routes - from every country, from every company whose components are used by Russian missile manufacturers Today, I signed new decrees to honor our warriors with state awards, including the servicemen of the Air Force, our air defense, those heroes who save the lives of our people every night, every day. Also, our intelligence officers and servicemen of the Armed Forces - combat brigades and units - were awarded. In total, 331 warriors. 331 heroic lives. Please always remember that all of us in Ukraine owe our lives to those who stood up to defend the lives of our people and our independence. Respect for our warriors, respect for the families of our warriors, respect for the wives and husbands of all those who have stood up to defend the state is a must. Gratitude to these people is a must. Ukraine knows how to be grateful, and it should be shown every day. I thank everyone who is fighting and working for our victory. I am especially grateful to everyone who is currently fighting in the east and south of our country, opening up strategic space for Ukraine, space for movement to victory. I thank all those who are now on the offensive and on the defensive, who are storming the occupiers&#x27; positions and repelling their attacks. Thank you all, warriors, for your bravery, for your resilience and for every meter of progress! Glory to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>By supporting Ukraine, the world supports protection from war, because the source of aggression is outside our borders - Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address to the Federal Assembly and the people of the Swiss Confederation</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-15</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Candinas, Mr. Speaker, for your kind words about Ukraine and our defense. Now, as we defend the lives of our people from Russian strikes and overcome the consequences of the terrible crimes of this war, including the largest ecocide in Europe, we need maximum unity. The unity of all those who share with us the key values - the value of life, the value of freedom, the value of law and the value of respect for every nation, every community and every person. When unity is at its highest, solidarity is also most effective. And when it is, life, freedom, law, and respect will definitely prevail. And today I am addressing you to talk about this unity. Dear members of the Federal Assembly! Dear people of Switzerland! The soul of the values that unite us is peace. Peace! Ukraine has never been the source of any wars of aggression. And even now, although it sounds somewhat paradoxical, the Ukrainian land is a territory of peace, because the source of this war, the source and cause of aggression, is outside our borders. Just imagine this... Every night, instead of going to sleep normally, our people check the news to see if there are warnings that Russian bombers are approaching the point of launching missiles over the Caspian Sea or elsewhere. This is more than 1,500 kilometers from our land! This is where the war takes wings. And when it is clear that there will be another Russian missile, another Russian attack, people immediately put their children to bed, for example, in a corridor where there are no windows and therefore it is safer, or go to a shelter. Imagine what it is like to live in communities that border Russia. Our border - three regions - is constantly suffering from purely terrorist attacks from Russian territory. Almost every night and every day. Towns, villages, houses, schools, churches, markets, businesses - everything... They are shelled across the border from Russian territory with artillery or mortars, missiles or guided bombs... This is death or the threat of death that comes to our land from Russia. Hundreds of Ukrainian families have lost their loved ones due to strikes by Iranian kamikaze drones – Shaheds, dozens of which the Russians launch at our cities almost every night. Fortunately, thanks to the defense assistance of our partners - and we are grateful for it - we are now able to shoot down most of the Shaheds. But, unfortunately, not all of them... They take the lives of our people and constantly destroy our infrastructure! And all this is also death that came from Russia. There is absolutely nothing in this brutal war that is taking place on our land that would make our land, our people, our Ukraine a source of war or the territory of those who want to take something from another nation. We are defending the lives of our people, our freedom, our independence, our values... Peace for Ukrainian children! It is to our peaceful land that those who burn towns and villages and turn everything they touch into black ruins came. It is from Russia that those who still occupy the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and cynically use it as a cover for the constant shelling of our cities came to Ukraine. It is from Russia that those who blew up the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant came to Ukraine, causing a man-made disaster and a colossal crime against people and nature, and they did it exactly on the occupied territory… Any unbiased view will confirm one thing - if war had not been brought from Russia to our peaceful Ukrainian land, there would have been no war. The source of evil and death is outside our borders. By supporting us, the world supports protection from war. That is why solidarity with our people is shown, in particular, even by those nations with which we had no meaningful relations before February 24, 2022, when Russia turned its hybrid aggression against our country into an open full-scale genocidal war. I am grateful for every package of sanctions against Russia that curbs Russia&#x27;s terrorist potential. I thank the world for every piece of weaponry that helps save people from Russian terror! I am grateful for every frozen asset of the Russian state and those individuals whose collaboration with the Kremlin has turned Russia into a terrorist state… All this helps curb the aggression - weapons for us, ever-increasing sanctions against Russia that prevent it from adapting to the world&#x27;s pressure, and justice for Ukrainians and the world. Justice, which we are bringing closer by establishing the Tribunal for Russian aggression. I am grateful to you, Switzerland, for not remaining indifferent to the suffering that Russia is bringing to our land with its aggression. You supported the joint European sanctions against Russia, and this is an important solidarity, because sanctions bring the end of this aggression closer. They should be intensified. I know that you are having a discussion about permits to re-export weapons to protect Ukraine. And I want every participant in the discussion to remember one fact: we are asking the world for weapons to make our Ukrainian territory a territory of peace again. All our land, all our people... Only for this! Exactly as envisaged by international law. Exactly as Mr. Speaker said at the beginning: a rules-based international order must guarantee freedom for every nation. We are not a source of aggression, not a territory of war, and not some kind of conflict zone. We are a country that has always valued and will always value peace, and you know it. Our peace can only withstand such aggression by force of arms. Last year, in the autumn, at the G19 Summit, I presented the Ukrainian Peace Formula. Different states and leaders are already involved in efforts to implement the Formula. It is designed so that everyone in the world can choose the component of restoring peace and security they can help implement most effectively. There are partners who have chosen radiation and food security. There are partners who are ready to help with the return of children who have been deported to the aggressor&#x27;s territory by the Russian occupiers and are being kept away from their families and Ukraine. Thousands and thousands of children stolen by Russia! We must bring them all home, back to Ukraine. There are partners who are ready to help with the restoration of justice and protection from ecocide and mine clearance… In March, in our conversation with Mr. President of Switzerland, Mr. Berset, I presented the points of the Peace Formula and our approach to its implementation. And now I invite all of you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you, Switzerland, to join the preparation of the Global Peace Summit and show your leadership in the part of the Formula where you consider your national experience to be most useful for the world and peace. And one more thing. The world has gone through various wars, and the more wars destroyed life, the greater was the understanding that defense against aggression and prevention of aggression require collective efforts and solidarity. We are now defending ourselves against aggression that replicates the worst wars of the past and seeks the best technologies of our time to terrorize people, states, and even continents. Nothing but unity can stop it. In particular, our unity! Thank you, Switzerland! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Another Ramstein today was quite productive, we are getting even stronger – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-15</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report for today. First, we have significant international steps that strengthen our position in several areas at once. The European Parliament has adopted a powerful resolution in support of our nation&#x27;s European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations. There is a concrete call to the leaders of the European Union to define a clear path for our country&#x27;s membership in the EU. And on the issue of the Alliance, the European Parliament sets exactly the meaning of our Ukrainian contribution to Euro-Atlantic security, which envisages that Ukraine&#x27;s path to NATO and a political invitation to accession should be developed in the context of preparations for the Alliance Summit in Vilnius already. The time for integration and security certainty has obviously come, and I thank all members of the European Parliament and the President of the European Parliament, Mrs. Roberta Metsola, as well as Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk for the constant and effective work with the parliaments of our partner countries. The second significant international step today is the bill registered in the United States on the confiscation and transfer to our country of the assets of the Russian state - a terrorist state - as reparations. I thank the U.S. Senators for the strong bipartisan support of this issue of justice for Ukraine and all victims of Russian terror. In dictatorships like Russia&#x27;s, money is the highest value. And especially for those who serve the ruling regime or are actually the owners of state structures. When the terrorist state and all Russian individuals whose collaboration with the Kremlin created the conditions for Russian aggression or who are a public cover for Russian corrupt officials lose their money, a very important goal will be achieved - they will feel what loss is. They do not respect life and do not feel regret when human lives are lost. The Russian ruling class does not value people and is willing to waste human lives by the hundreds of thousands. But they do care about money - the money they have appropriated, by the way. They value their assets. They must lose them completely, and in favor of those who suffered from their aggression, from this terrorist war, in favor of our state, our people. Today I continued to address the parliaments of our partner countries. I called on the parliamentarians and people of Switzerland to continue to stand in unity and solidarity with us in the defense of common values and freedom. It is very important that all of us in Europe equally understand that it is only by force of arms that we can now protect the way of life that we all value so much, in all countries - from the Atlantic area to Ukraine, including Switzerland. It is our common task to defend freedom, international law and human life. I also had phone calls with representatives of two countries - Belize and Costa Rica. We are building new partnerships for Ukraine to support the Peace Formula and our resolutions at the UN in defense of the UN Charter and international law in general. I discussed with Mr. President of Costa Rica and Mr. Prime Minister of Belize the possibility of organizing a meeting between Ukraine and Latin America. Together we can provide much more protection for the freedom and equality of nations in the modern world. An important report was made today on the situation in Kherson region and in the south of the country, in our Dnipropetrovsk region, after the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Disaster relief, humanitarian aid, drinking water supply and all other sensitive and important issues. Prime Minister Shmyhal, Minister of Internal Affairs Klymenko, specialized Deputy Head of the Office Kuleba, and representatives of local authorities. Another report was on the situation in Kryvyi Rih and Odesa after the recent terrorist attacks. And, of course, the frontline. I thank all our warriors, every unit, every combat brigade for today - for today&#x27;s battles. I would like to mention six units in particular. The Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops - paratroopers of our powerful 80th separate airborne assault brigade. The Tavria operational and strategic group of troops - warriors of our 23rd separate mechanized brigade, marines of the 35th and 37th separate brigades, warriors of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade of Zakarpattia and the 128th separate brigade of the territorial defense forces... Thank you all, guys, for your efficiency! For your strength, courage and for returning Ukrainian land to Ukraine and strengthening our Ukrainian will. Glory to everyone who is now in combat, at combat posts and on combat missions! Glory to all who train our warriors! Who treats and rehabilitates our defenders after their injuries! I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps. And by the way, another Ramstein today was quite productive. We are getting even stronger! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Each of our soldiers, each new step, each meter of Ukrainian land freed from the enemy is the most important thing – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-16</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, dear Ukrainian women! Today was a long day. With many events, and a lot of news. Meeting in a special format – Ukraine and African countries. Long discussions... The Peace Formula, security issues, grain, our joint capabilities to protect the principles and goals of the UN Charter, to protect nations from aggression. I called on the leaders and states of Africa to participate in the Global Peace Summit we are preparing. Ukraine will be heard all over the world, and we will involve the whole world in the implementation of the Peace Formula. It is not easy, but we are working. Today was also the graduation from the National Defense University of Ukraine. I had the honor to congratulate our officers. I was very pleased to do it. I am especially grateful to our air defense forces – everyone who defends the Ukrainian sky. The downing of Russian missiles today, including six ballistic missiles, is very important and symbolic. No one can be intimidated by Russia. And there was another event today, another point in my schedule that has not yet been announced. This is the War Cabinet. Our commanders – generals Syrsky, Tarnavsky, Zaluzhny, Shaptala. And our commanders in specific directions of active actions - I won&#x27;t say their names yet, everything in its own time. Our advancement is the most important thing. Each of our soldiers, each of our new steps, and each meter of Ukrainian land freed from the enemy is the most important thing. And there was Budanov... Separate steps. I&#x27;m thankful to everyone who is now fighting for Ukraine! I&#x27;m thankful to everyone who is preparing to enter the battle! And I&#x27;m thankful to everyone who helps us so much, potently! Glory to Ukraine! We will defeat everyone!</p>

  <h2>I would like to thank all partners who this week took new steps in supporting our state and people – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I want to thank today. To thank all our partners who really help and who this week took new steps in supporting our state and our people. The United States – I want to thank for another substantial security aid package. Anti-aircraft defense, artillery, and rounds for HIMARS, anti-tank weapons, armored vehicles, other tools for the defense of freedom. Thank you! The Netherlands – thanks for the new defense package that will strengthen our air shield. The joint work of the Netherlands, the United States, Denmark, and the United Kingdom to buy anti-aircraft missiles. This is what will save thousands of our people. Germany – thank you for the equipment delivered this week, for the unchanged strength in protecting life from Russian missile terror. Thank you for your willingness to provide us with missiles for the Patriot systems! Italy – thank you for implementing our defense agreements! Thank you, Denmark, for your willingness to work quickly so that our coalition of modern fighters can really bring the end of this war closer to our victory. Joint victory! Thank you again! Denmark and Norway – I want to thank you separately for your joint work to strengthen our artillery. Russia has brought such a war to Europe when it depends on the artillery whether freedom moves forward. Thank you for the rounds for our soldiers! Sweden – the twelfth defense aid package and a real readiness to start training our pilots on modern fighters. Thank you! The United Kingdom – thank you for your continued leadership in expanding our defense capabilities and for every long-range missile we have been given – all of which are 100 percent operational. This week a decision on additional support. Thank you again! Canada – thank you for your continued help and for the new steps we have worked out, now being implemented. Artillery, air defense... Thanks to all Ramstein participating countries – another meeting was held this week. Thanks for the unwavering constructiveness! I would like to personally thank each country, each leader, all cities and communities in partner countries, all international organizations that help us overcome the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovka HPP. We will once again prove the invincibility of our collective power when we restore normal life to all people and communities affected by this Russian evil of ecocide. Poland – thank you for the resolution adopted by the Seimas in support of Ukraine&#x27;s membership in NATO. The right signals at the right time – when we are preparing meaningful content for the summit in Vilnius. Luxembourg – I want to thank you for the parliament&#x27;s decision, recognizing the historical truth, the truth about the Holodomor – the genocide of the Ukrainian people. Luxembourg became the 26th country to officially recognize the Holodomor as genocide. And we continue our work – for the global recognition of the truth. And, of course, many thanks to all those who train our soldiers… who share their experience with our heroes, and who themselves learn from Ukrainians. Learn Ukrainian resilience, courage, and an unbreakable desire to fight for the life for own country and Ukrainian children. It will definitely be – we will fight for this! We will prevail. Tavria operational-strategic group – by the way, I want to thank you for moving forward, soldiers! Well done! All our warriors in the East, strong warriors – I thank you for your resilience and accuracy! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our troops are advancing, step by step we are moving forward - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-18</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! This week is coming to an end - a very important week for all of us, for our defense, for our steps forward, for our offensive actions. And it is time to thank all our warriors. Those who have distinguished themselves this week. The Tavria direction is the toughest. Marines of the 35th separate brigade - thank you! Paratroopers of the “Seventy-ninth” - thank you! The 130th separate reconnaissance separate battalion - thank you! The 68th separate hunting brigade - thank you! The 23rd separate mechanized brigade - thank you! Artillerymen of the 44th brigade - thank you! I would like to especially mention the company of attack drones of the 47th separate mechanized brigade led by Chief Sergeant Rustam Mustafayev. Thank you for the result, warriors! The crew of the armored demining vehicle of the 70th separate support regiment - Senior Sergeant Mykola Nikandrov and Junior Sergeant Roman Lisin. Well done, guys! Our National Guard - thank you all! And I would like to particularly mention Senior Sergeant Vasyl Kovylin and Platoon Commander Denys Zeleny, the 4th operational battalion, the 1st presidential brigade of the National Guard. Thank you! The guys are performing tasks in Luhansk region - near Bilohorivka. Our border guards... I would like to mention the Lutsk and Lviv border guard detachments in particular. Senior Soldier Vasyl Kutsyk, Avdiivka direction, is very effective in repelling attacks. Thank you! Sergeant Vadym Druzhyna, Siversk direction, successfully &quot;subtracts&quot; enemy soldiers and equipment. Thank you! And of course, our defenders of the sky. Over a week, more than a hundred group air strikes on enemy positions and rear. Thank you, our pilots! Almost three dozen missiles and about fifty attack drones were destroyed in seven days. And I would like to celebrate the defenders of the Kyiv region&#x27;s sky, the 96th Kyiv air defense missile brigade of the Air Force... Thank you! All &quot;Kalibrs&quot; and &quot;Kinzhals&quot; were destroyed during these attacks, and thus the lives of our people were saved. And by the way, I want to say a few things. First of all, no matter who in Russia says that our Patriots have been destroyed, they are still here, they are working, all of them are shooting down Russian missiles. As efficiently as possible. Not a single Patriot has been destroyed! Secondly, you all saw how the visit of the delegation of African leaders and representatives went - a visit to Ukraine, and then a visit to the terrorist state. The delegation had the opportunity to see who is really interested in peace and who himself embodies war, it was very clear. Everything that was discussed in Ukraine was about the Peace Formula. Point by point. The whole content. Everything that was said in Russia was about war, about how to continue destroying lives. It is obvious that there is no alternative to the Peace Formula. It is good that the world hears and sees this more and more. Third, as for the terrorist state. Their only concern now should be how to prepare their society, Russian society, to the fact that they will lose everything they are destroying the future of their state for. Russia will lose the occupied territories. There is no and will be no alternative to our steps for de-occupation. Our troops are advancing, position by position, step by step, we are moving forward This week, we had Ramstein, and the main thing is the speed of supply. Next week, we will have new important communications with our partners, for the sake of our movement, for the sake of weapons, for the sake of our warriors having everything they need. I am grateful to everyone who is now in combat, in positions and at combat posts! I thank everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The evil state has no such fortifications or reserves that will stop Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-19</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on this day. The Staff. First of all, the frontline, specific issues of the offensive. There were reports from senior commanders and commanders directly from the battlefields. There was also a report by the Commander-in-Chief, the Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Separately and in detail, we considered the preparation and provision of equipment for the new brigades of the National Guard and our border guards - those who are waiting for their time to engage in combat operations. In some areas our warriors are moving forward, in some areas they are defending their positions and resisting the occupiers&#x27; assaults and intensified attacks. We have no lost positions. Only liberated ones. They have only losses. In general, it is a situation of pressure, our pressure, which allows us to pave the way for our flag. Blue and yellow colors will be all over our south and all over our east. And the evil state has no such fortifications or reserves that will stop Ukraine. Because we are on our own land, and this gives us the greatest strength. I thank all of our warriors - every soldier, every sergeant, every officer and every general who are involved in our active offensive and defensive actions now. I thank you for each liberated and each defended position! Today, in a conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, I outlined our current defense needs and thanked him for the defense support provided. For example, the British Storm Shadow long-range missiles are doing a very useful and accurate job at the front. As well as many other weapons supplied by the British. And this cooperation will have a significant continuation. Of course, we discussed with Rishi, with Mr. Prime Minister, the preparations for the NATO Summit in Vilnius and the content of this meeting of the Alliance. Today, there is also a significant political decision by the UK regarding sanctions - to maintain sanctions against Russia until the aggressor compensates for all the damage done to our people and our country. And it is very important that the assets of the aggressor state and all those associated with it, associated with the system of domination that the Kremlin has built on the territory of Russia, are used to compensate for the damage caused by the Russian war and terror. This will be fair, and I am grateful to all British people who support us on the path to justice. We also discussed with Rishi the preparations for the conference on Ukraine&#x27;s reconstruction in London. It will take place in the coming days, and we expect it to consolidate various international efforts, including those of big business, to support our recovery. A recovery that should demonstrate to the world that freedom is invincible. I discussed the conference, financial cooperation, and our movement towards the EU with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. This week we are expecting an interim verbal assessment of our work on the European Commission&#x27;s recommendations. We discussed sanctions issues in detail, in particular the 11th sanctions package against Russia for the war. Today I also spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte and Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen. As always, we paid attention to the frontline and our joint defense efforts, and I thanked them for their support and willingness to develop our cooperation for security. I informed them about the talks with African leaders and representatives who visited Ukraine last week and then visited the terrorist state. Each such international step only convinces again and again that the world should work more actively with the Peace Formula. Because this is the only Formula that responds comprehensively enough to every aspect of Russian madness. And one more thing. The World Bank. I spoke with the President of the Bank today. And not only about cooperation now, but also about the post-war transformation of Ukraine. About the decisions and steps, about the new doctrine of a new Ukraine, a victorious Ukraine, steps that we will prepare and implement. All together. Just as we are now overcoming this aggression together. I am grateful to everyone who is now in combat, at combat posts, in combat positions! Today I would like to highlight the Artan assault unit of the Main Intelligence Directorate and its commander, Major Torkotiuk. Thank you! And also our Special Operations Forces. Viktor, all the guys - thank you very much! Thank you to everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>A rebuilt and strengthened Ukraine means protection against all forms of Russian terror - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-20</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! A brief report on this day. First of all, I thank our Air Force and all the defenders of the sky from our other defense forces for every downed Russian missile and Shahed. Last night alone, more than 30 Shaheds were shot down. These are hundreds of saved lives, saved infrastructure. Thank you, warriors! Second. Today in Kherson, rescuers were injured as a result of the occupiers&#x27; shelling... They were relieving the consequences of the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and were shelled by Russian artillery. Eight SES workers were injured, one, unfortunately, was killed... My condolences to their families and friends! Ukrainian warriors will definitely give the terrorists a response to all this meanness. Every such Russian strike, every Russian terrorist attack is an argument that the occupiers have no chance of staying anywhere on Ukrainian soil. There is no place here for murderers and terrorists and there will never be. Now our warriors in the south and in the east are very actively destroying the enemy, physically clearing Ukraine. This will continue in the future. Protection against terror means the destruction of terrorists. And it is a guarantee that the evil state will never again have the opportunity to bring evil to Ukraine. This is what the third point is about today. The first meetings have already begun in London in the framework of the conference on Ukraine&#x27;s recovery, which we have been preparing together with our British friends. Discussions have already taken place in Switzerland and Germany, in France and Italy. There is work at various levels for our recovery. And we are directing this work in such a way that our reconstruction, our recovery will become not only construction projects, but also a global project of protection. A rebuilt Ukraine, a transformed Ukraine, a strengthened Ukraine is a carrier of security and a guarantor of security, it is protection against any form of Russian terror and protection against any repetition of Russian aggression. Tomorrow at the London conference, I will present some aspects of our philosophy of Ukraine&#x27;s transformation. The full vision will be presented later this month. And already in Ukraine. Together with our partners and all of us here at home in Ukraine, we must ensure that only security, freedom and peace will come after us. I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! I thank each of our warriors who are now in combat, at combat posts and on combat missions! Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk region - well done, guys! I am grateful to everyone who trains our soldiers and helps us with weapons! Ukraine uses every weapon and every shell as efficiently as possible and always to protect lives. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>When we build Ukraine, we will build freedom – online speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-21</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much! Happy to see you, Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister! Thank you for your kind words about Ukraine, about our soldiers, and thanks for your leadership and support the UK provides to Ukraine. Thank you that we are really united in defending freedom. Dear leaders of politics, business and public opinion! Dear Presidents, Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries, CEOs and heads of international organizations! And, of course, dear journalists! When we are talking about recovery, we are talking about millions of jobs, billions in corporate profits and trillions of GDPs. And not only for Ukraine, but for all our countries – mine and yours. Countries that want and will live freely despite any predatory ambitions of various &quot;putins&quot;, whose brains are poisoned by dreams of war. Growth is always based on values. Just as strong investments are preceded by trust, so the growth that we are preparing must be preceded by confidence that what has been rebuilt will not fall. And it&#x27;s not about bricks, but about life in general. The world is abundant with ruins reminding us of the wars of the past. And politics in different regions, unfortunately, is abundant with sick ideas of hatred and resentment, which point to possible wars in the future. And although no one has the power to cleanse the depths of human nature from the evil that sometimes rises to the surface and destroys and kills... But you and I, and right now, we are able to protect life and overcome the ruins after the Russian aggression in such a way as to block the path for evil – meaning for any new aggressions. The eyes of the world are looking at us. And at whether we will defeat Russian aggression exactly as freedom deserves to win – that is, without compromising our values. Also the world is watching to see if we will restore normal life in such a way that our transformation will land an ideological defeat on the aggressor. We protect Ukraine and thus we protect freedom, and when we build Ukraine – we’ll build freedom. Country, region, continent, world… It’s a global task. And I want to thank you. And, of course, I thank Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy – every country where we have agreed on key principles for recovery. At this Conference, we must move from vision to agreements, and from agreements to real projects. There is a Ukrainian delegation in London that will present concrete things that we propose to do together. In my turn, I will outline five directions in which we have begun to create foundations for peace. The first is the potential of unity. The second is the potential of stability. The third is growth potential. The fourth is security potential. And the fifth – extremely important – is the potential of democracy. So, the first point – we are strengthening unity. Ukraine has already succeeded in making the EU as united as it has never been before. This is truly a unity of values, which is reflected in many political, economic, sanction and humanitarian decisions. Ukraine has activated all that power of solidarity for which the EU was conceived. And Ukraine is also activating the moral force of NATO. This is important for all of us. What does the world see now? Does it recognize NATO&#x27;s moral leadership in protecting peace? This is only possible with Ukraine in the Alliance. Just as Ukraine already belongs to the value space of the EU, we already belong to the NATO security space. De facto. Just as Ukraine is already part of the EU&#x27;s common market and on its way to full membership, we are already defending the common space of freedom in the Alliance and are only waiting for the courage of the Alliance leaders to recognize this reality politically. Thanks to the same values, we are developing strong bilateral alliances with such leaders of the democratic world as the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, all the EU members. And this gives us new power in defense, economy and global prospects for democracy. We build our alliances and thus we are safeguarding the level of freedom to which our people are used to. Second – we are strengthening stability. At least 600 million consumers around the world directly depend on our agricultural production. This is a huge potential for food security. At the times of this war, when Russia blocked our ports and destroyed freedom of navigation in the Black and Azov Seas, the world saw what Ukrainian grain is. Without it, there is a threat of price crises and social collapse in different countries. We have now partially restored the movement of our agricultural products by sea through two export initiatives. And this is stability for a huge social and economic space – from Morocco to Somalia, from China to Lebanon, from Türkiye to India, from Spain to Pakistan. Different aspects, different influences, but always a contribution to stability. Another similar area is the energy sector. I believe that there is no alternative to the green transformation of the economy, and Russian aggression has proven that green transformation is one of the key foundations of security. Each strike on our energy facilities and each manifestation of Russian blackmail with the energy crisis ends the era of fossil fuel dominance and old energy habits, when entire regions could depend on a single supplier, such as Russia. It is green energy that guarantees real energy stability. Ukraine can be – and will be! – one of the key suppliers of clean electricity and green hydrogen to Europe. The potential of this industry alone is about four hundred billion dollars. We build agricultural and energy facilities in Ukraine and thus we’re protecting the world from chaos. Third point – we strengthen the growth. There is currently no place in the world where there is a need to construct and rebuild as many objects as in Ukraine. Every new day of Russian aggression brings new ruins. Thousands and thousands of destroyed houses, devastated industries, burnt lives… Recently, Russia committed also the largest crime of ecocide in Europe by blowing up the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant. What does all this mean? In Ukraine, there is the largest source of economic, industrial and technological growth in Europe for decades and decades. And, by the way, it&#x27;s not only reconstruction. For example, the green transformation of energy logically stimulates the development of industries such as green metallurgy and green fertilizers. Thanks to its natural resources and industrial traditions, Ukraine can become one of the key global centers of green metallurgy. In addition, we have significant reserves of critical resources for the modern economy, such as lithium. By building with Ukraine and in Ukraine, we fend off our countries and our countries&#x27; companies from recessions. Fourth point – we strengthen security. This war demonstrates what effective defense against aggression in the modern world means… What weapons are needed and to what extent, what infrastructure is lacking and what production is a priority, what technologies save lives on a large scale, and what systems make it possible to make science fiction a reality on the battlefield. From the production of combat drones to conventional artillery, from an air shield that covers the entire country or even a region to shelters in every school, from infrastructure that is built so that it cannot be destroyed by the Iranian &quot;Shaheds&quot; to cyberspace that remains resilient even in the face of constant cyberattacks. We are doing all of this in Ukraine, and we need the experience of partners in all of this. We build security together and thus we convince the world that democracies cannot be defeated. And finally, the fifth point – democracy. Russia invaded Ukraine not only to steal our land, resources and people. It is obvious that without Ukraine there can be no Russian Empire. And it is equally obvious that Russia&#x27;s bosses are very afraid of our democracy. Why? Because democracy paves the way for the rule of law, getting rid of corruption and to the key principle of our countries – every person matters. It is very important. Of course, democracy is in the nature of Ukrainians. And we would strengthen it anyway, no matter what they think or do in Russia. But we all have to realize that the more democracy we have, the greater its strength in our entire region. The more rule of law we have, the more law will work here on the eastern flank of Europe. And the more transparent Ukraine is, the uglier any corruption model will look in Russia. Even Russia&#x27;s full-scale aggression has not stopped our internal reforms. Ukraine will be associated with a fair court, just as it is now associated with courage. Step by step, we will get there. Thanks to digital transformation, we will show the world how the state can function effectively without any contact between an official and a citizen or a company. All public services can and will be transferred online – from business registration or social assistance to any other public service. And we are already exporting our digitalization to other regions and other countries. We have started such cooperation with Estonia and will continue with Colombia and Zambia. And I am sure that this is just the beginning. Please be sure to ask our team, our government officials for more details about this… this is truly an example of social progress through technology. Even before February 24th, we started dismantling the old oligarchic model of economic relations from the post-Soviet period. And this is not just something about the personalities of the oligarchs, it is about changing the approach to economic relations. Financial transparency and banking system resilience, market liberalization and competition stimulation, guaranteeing equal and legal conditions for every economic entity – are all areas in which we made progress before February 24 and which are very important now. We build institutions and continue reforms in Ukraine and thus we are defending democracy and preserving it as a hope for all, at least in our region, that democracy will prevail. Ladies and Gentlemen! By building Ukraine, we are building much more than one country. We build the world as it will be during the lifetime of our generation and after us. Will it be peaceful? Will it be stable? Will it be democratic? It depends on each and everyone of us. I invite all of you to Ukraine! By the way, Prime Minister Rishi, we have not seen each other in Kyiv for quite a while… Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Thank you UK! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>It is our state that global hopes are focused on, and our people will justify them: Ukraine will win – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-21</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! First. Front. Fierce battles. South – we&#x27;re destroying the enemy. Donetsk direction – we&#x27;re destroying the enemy. The Kupiansk direction – whatever the Russian terrorists are planning there, we will destroy the enemy. In the South, we are advancing. Thank you, warriors! In the East, our defenses are firming. And I am especially grateful, guys, for every shot down Russian helicopter... Each shooting down is important. Second. London. Our special Ukraine Recovery Conference organized with the British began today. Thank you, the United Kingdom, for the new financial support package. Thank you, the United States, for the package for our infrastructure and energy. Thank you, the European Union, for the EUR 50 billion financial instrument presented by President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for our reconstruction. The purpose of this Conference in London is not simply to generate the efforts of our partner states, but also to have international business support for our transformation. Currently, a Ukrainian delegation is working in the UK – the government, the Office, the Verkhovna Rada, the public sector. Every aspect of Ukrainian recovery and further development of our state will be presented to those global business figures whose attention we directly need: our industries, cities, communities, the country in general. Ukraine&#x27;s task is to transform the moral leadership of our people into the economic leadership of our country. All the prerequisites for this exist, first of all, in our people, in our beautiful strong nation. Third. A new package of EU sanctions against Russia is finally being approved. Part of its norms was prepared based on the proposals of the International Sanctions Group chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak. This package will further limit Russia&#x27;s profits it has received in Europe so far, and will also block some of the routes to bypass the previously introduced sanctions. This is now one of the priority tasks. All our partners are fully aware of how crucial it is to block all avenues to circumvent sanctions. The terrorist state still has access to various products and components, technological and financial schemes, created by those in the world who still value freedom and international law. Russia must be in complete isolation while Russia&#x27;s main export products are evil and death. And one more. I accepted credentials from ambassadors of foreign countries who arrived in Ukraine. Norway, Switzerland, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Iceland. New ambassadors. In general, more than 60 embassies and representative offices of states and more than 20 representative offices of international organizations operate in our country. To work in Ukraine, to work with Ukraine, is to believe in Ukraine and Ukrainians. The world is with us despite everything the evil state tries to do against us. The 483rd day of the full-scale war. It is our state that global hopes are focused on. And our people will justify these hopes. Freedom will win. Ukraine will win. I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Glory to all who strengthen freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must become a global community, so that peace for every nation is fully guaranteed - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Organization of American States</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. Secretary-General! Dear members of the General Assembly! Thank you for the opportunity to address you. And the main thing I would like to talk about today is collectivity. Eight months ago, I addressed your Organization for the first time, and I am grateful for all the support that you, both as an Organization and as countries, have given to our people, to our right to live freely. The vast majority of you support UN General Assembly resolutions that defend a rules-based international order. And your personal position, Mr. Almagro, serves precisely to protect the key foundations of international relations – the equality of all nations and guarantees for every nation that its destiny will not be broken by other states through military or political violence. Our common goal, of all leaders and states that truly value human life, is a world in which violence does not dominate… A world in which the UN Charter is truly respected by everyone, from the smallest to the largest countries. A world in which not only no new frozen conflicts arise, but in which the majority of nations realize that any war is a common global challenge – a threat to the world, and not the suffering of only those against whom this aggression is committed. And have we become closer to such a world since my first address to you? I am sure we have. Although Russian aggression still goes on, although Russia does not stop even in the face of catastrophic crimes of ecocide... Probably, you all heard that this month Russian occupiers blew up the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant and destroyed one of the largest reservoirs in Europe, deliberately flooding a huge area... Dozens of cities and villages were under water. The one in Russia who gave the order to destroy the dam and the Kakhovka reservoir understood what he was doing… Understood that it would leave entire regions of our country without drinking water… Understood that thousands and thousands of hectares of fertile soil would become a desert... God forbid that anyone in the world faces such a crime. But despite this and all other Russian terrorist attacks, we are still pushing the aggressor to defeat – both by force of arms and by force of diplomacy. Ladies and Gentlemen! Last year, I presented the Ukrainian Peace Formula, and since then, we have already involved dozens of nations in working on its implementation. We are also preparing the Global Peace Summit, which will specifically determine which state will help in which point of the Peace Formula. There is no alternative to it! Russia has brought war to the territory of our country, Russian missiles and artillery are burning our cities and villages, Russian ecocides are destroying the nature of our country... So, it is Ukrainians who best understand what exactly needs to be done to restore peace. But to indeed restore peace, we need collective efforts. And of course – in particular, your support, your leadership. I invite you to work with us and all the free nations of the world on implementation of the Peace Formula. And I invite you to join the preparation of the Global Peace Summit. We must become a global community in the full sense of this word, so that peace for every nation is fully guaranteed. One cannot protect peace on his own, but war cannot overcome the collective desire for peace. May your power become the power of peace, too! Thank you for your attention! Long live freedom! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>President of Ukraine: Russia is considering a scenario of a terrorist attack at the Zaporizhzhia NPP with radiation leakage, the world must act</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! And all the people of the world. All of them - I emphasize this. We have just had a report from our intelligence and the Security Service of Ukraine. Two points. The Russian terrorist attack at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant that took place. And another terrorist attack, which, unfortunately, is being prepared by the Russian occupiers, at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Regarding Kakhovka. Ukrainian intelligence and the Security Service of Ukraine have gathered new evidence of how Russian terrorists blew up the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It was an absolutely deliberate, premeditated crime. In the occupied territory, at a plant that was under the full control of the occupiers. And, importantly, last year we warned the world that Russia was preparing such a terrorist attack. We warned them when we received the first confirmed information about the mining of the hydroelectric power plant. Now concerning the Zaporizhzhia NPP. I remind those who have forgotten: this is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Everyone in the world - the IAEA, all countries, all leaders - knows exactly what is happening there. Russia uses the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as an element in its aggression. It occupies the plant. It uses it to cover the shelling of neighboring cities. It keeps weapons and troops there. Now our intelligence has received information that Russia is considering a scenario of a terrorist attack at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. A terrorist attack with radiation leakage. They have prepared everything for this. Unfortunately, I have repeatedly had to remind that radiation has no state borders. And who it will hit is determined only by the wind direction… We share all available information with our partners – everyone in the world. All the evidence. Europe, America, China, Brazil, India, the Arab world, Africa – all countries, absolutely everyone should know this. International organizations. Absolutely everyone. There should never be any terrorist attacks on nuclear power plants anywhere. This time it should not be like with Kakhovka – the world has been warned, so the world can and must act. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Full de-occupation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is a must, and anyone who turned a blind eye to its occupation by Russia is actually contributing to terror - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today was a very busy day. First, we held a briefing for our partner countries on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. There were representatives of the G7 and G20 countries, as well as representatives of international organizations. Here, in the Office. The MID, the Office&#x27;s team, our diplomats provided the available information. Our principle is simple: the world must know what the occupier is preparing. Everyone who knows must act. Of course, after the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and deliberate terrorist attacks on other dams and energy facilities, no one in the world should have any illusions about Russia anymore. It is Russia that is now the global center of cynicism, and any order for any evil that they hope to disguise as a disaster can come from there. The world has enough power to prevent any radiation incidents, let alone a radiation catastrophe. Everyone understands that the intelligence services of different countries can give appropriate signals and exert pressure. This is necessary. We will continue to inform our partners. We will also provide information to those countries that are pretending to be neutral even now. Obviously, radiation does not ask who is neutral and can reach anyone in the world. Accordingly, anyone in the world can help now, and it is quite clear what to do. Full de-occupation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is a must. And anyone who turns a blind eye to Russia&#x27;s occupation of such a facility, to Russia&#x27;s mining of the territory and facilities of the nuclear power plant, is actually contributing not only to this Russian evil, but also to terror in general. And today I have instructed Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Ihor Klymenko to take all the necessary measures, to conduct all the necessary explanatory work with our people about all the existing risks. And this will be done in the near future. Today, we discussed relevant security issues with the intelligence service, the Security Service of Ukraine and the Ministry of Internal Affairs - both those related to the Zaporizhzhia plant and those related to the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. We are doing our best to engage as many forces and means as possible to put pressure and influence on the terrorist state. There was also a separate report by the Minister of Internal Affairs on support for people and life in Kherson region and other areas of our South that suffered from the destruction of the Kakhovka reservoir. Of course, we also have information about what is happening in the occupied part of Kherson region. For this, even the word &quot;catastrophe&quot; is not enough. The Russian evil has formed special groups there to remove and, obviously, hide the bodies of the dead. This is not the first time Russia has done this - it is trying to destroy evidence and traces of its crimes in the occupied territory. They did this in Mariupol and other places. But this is a truth that cannot be hidden. And I thank everyone who helps our intelligence, our special services to get the necessary information! I also held a meeting on the spiritual independence of Ukraine - we continue to work on this, and we will take new steps. Obviously, there can be no true spiritual ties with a terrorist state and those who justify the murder of Ukrainians and cover up evil. Every day and every night of Russian terror proves this. And we will reach the point where all dependencies on Russia, which someone somewhere is trying to manipulate, will be destroyed. One more thing. Today I would like to express my special gratitude to all those who, even in such times and circumstances, are investing their efforts to ensure that our people and our country have their own cultural strength. Today, another Book Arsenal has begun its work in Kyiv. &quot;Arsenal&quot; is the word that best characterizes the meaning of culture. It is what makes people human, what makes humanity stronger. It is what protects and spreads our experience through time - of each and every one of us, of our entire nation, of our entire Ukraine, of our entire Europe, of our entire humanity. Please, if you have the opportunity, visit the Book Arsenal these days and always support the cultural power. I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! I thank everyone who is now in combat - in the South, in the East, in Zaporizhzhia, in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Thank you! Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine and defends life and humanity with us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>You are united by a common choice, high responsibility, courage, determination and loyalty to Ukraine, and in the future, you will all be united by victory – address by the President of Ukraine to the officers – graduates of military universities</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-23</span></div>
  <p>Dear attendees, ladies and gentlemen, generals, officers, sergeants, soldiers, lecturers and cadets! What unites you all? What unites us all? In this address, among other things, I want to talk about this. And it&#x27;s not just about today&#x27;s graduation ceremony. Certainly, an important event for you and our country. It is also about the values we profess, the actions we take, the challenges we face, and the future that awaits us. What unites yesterday, today and tomorrow. The first is choice. The choice of your own destiny and your own path. Serving the state. Protecting Ukraine. The conscious choice of millions that makes everyone a single monolithic army, regardless of gender, age or status. Generals, officers, sergeants, soldiers, cadets. Many of you have participated in combat operations in the East even before you studied for your specialties and have relevant combat experience. From the very first hours of the full-scale war, you and your lecturers took up arms, reinforced the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and bravely stood up to defend Ukraine. This choice gives rise to the second thing that unites everyone. This is responsibility. The last years of your studies were the most difficult and life-changing for you. With the beginning of the large-scale invasion, under fire, you successfully moved the educational and scientific units to the places of temporary deployment. In a short time, you established the educational process. We withstood and prevented the occupier from seizing important centers and institutions, including military education institutions. And today, the officer corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is being joined by a worthy replenishment of officers who graduate from your educational institutions. And I want to mention each of them. To thank each of you. To express my wishes to everyone. I congratulate Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University on this day! Dozens of officers and cadets of your university have mastered new weapons during their studies. Among them are Bayraktar, IRIS-T, NASAMS, Patriot and many others. We are confident that in the future there will be F-16s among them. We are confident that Ukrainian combat falcons will successfully cover our skies. We are confident that our air defense system will reliably protect us from enemy missiles and UAVs. All our people on the ground believe in you. May all the heavenly powers help you. I congratulate the Military Institute of Tank Troops on this day! From the first hours of the war, officers, sergeants and cadets of the Institute defended Kharkiv, performed tasks to strengthen the units of the Armed Forces and the National Guard of Ukraine, as part of tank, mechanized and rifle units, destroyed enemy manpower and equipment, together with other forces of the Kharkiv defense did not allow the occupiers to break into the city, and later participated in the liberation of many settlements in Kharkiv region. There is a saying about tankers: &quot;Those who forge victory with armor gloves on&quot;. I sincerely wish that the day will come when you will be able to take off these gloves and hug your parents, your children, and all your loved ones. I congratulate the Kruty Heroes Military Institute of Telecommunications and Informatization! From the beginning of the large-scale Russian aggression, the institute&#x27;s military personnel took part in the defense of Kyiv, in particular the government quarter. For many years you have been training qualified specialists in information technology, electronic communications, and other military sciences. Immediately after the outbreak of war, you organized training for UAV operators of various types, mastering the latest communications equipment, and soon afterwards you opened a cyber lab and deployed a cyber intelligence training complex. I wish you success in your less visible, but no less important work. I wish you to ensure reliable communication and hear only good news about the small and big victories of our Homeland! I sincerely congratulate the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy! And not only on this solemn day, because you have another reason for congratulations. This year, the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy celebrated its 30th anniversary. All this time, you have been training military doctors professionally and qualitatively for the needs of all branches and individual types of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - from among the officers. You save the lives of those who save the life of the country. You protect freedom and independence. I thank you for your important and difficult work. I wish you health and long life to you, your families and everyone you help on a daily basis. I congratulate the lecturers and students of the Military Training Department of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine! Together, you are training highly qualified veterinary specialists for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other important formations. Today we are countering the enemy in all directions and with all our might. And when not only the military and equipment, but also the forces of nature, everything that exists on our land, take part in achieving a common victory. When not only people become heroes, and one of the symbols of resistance and service to the country is the already legendary dog Patron. And thousands of other animals who are helping in the battle against the Russian beast both on the frontline and in the rear. And it will definitely be defeated. I congratulate the Military Institute of Kyiv National University on this day! Since February 24 last year, the Institute&#x27;s servicemen have been defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of Kyiv as part of the Kyiv City Defense Forces, and despite constant missile and bomb attacks and artillery shelling by the enemy, they have been defending strategically important facilities. The Military Institute of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv provides training in almost two dozen specialties and specializations. I wish all the graduates success and the soonest possible realization of the prophetic words of the Great Kobzar: And on renewed holy land Will be no enemy, no traitor, But rather will be son and mother, And people will be on the land. I thank all the lecturers and staff of each educational institution for the training, experience, and knowledge that your students have gained and are gaining. Yesterday they were cadets, soon they will become officers, tomorrow some of them will join the ranks of our country&#x27;s defense forces, while others will continue their studies to join the ranks of the Ukrainian army after obtaining a master&#x27;s degree. You are all united not only by a common choice and high responsibility. You are all united by courage, determination, patriotism, loyalty to Ukraine, readiness to defend it and the desire to liberate it. This means - and there is no doubt about it - that there is something that will unite everyone in the future. This is victory. And may you be united by Ukraine, its present, and its memory on your way to it. And so now I would like to honor the memory of all those who gave their lives for Ukraine in this Russian-Ukrainian war, the war for independence. I would like to honor them with a moment of silence. * Thank you! Glory to our Armed Forces! Glory to our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Security is the first priority - address by the President of Ukraine following the NSDC meeting</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-23</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians! I held the NSDC meeting. Three issues on the agenda. Most importantly, Ministers Klymenko and Kamyshin presented the first summary of the inspection of shelters in the regions of our country: Klymenko - across the country, Kamyshin - for Kyiv. In general, today we reviewed the situation with shelters in the regions, districts and cities most intensively terrorized by the enemy. The results are poor. Almost all over the country. This includes Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Konotop, Bila Tserkva, and many other cities. The situation is particularly cynical and shameful in those cities that have significant financial resources but, unfortunately, other priorities. There will be personnel decisions. Accessible and reliable shelters across the country should be and will be a priority for leaders at all levels. Security is the first priority. The Prosecutor General informed the NSDC about the legal action taken by the prosecutor&#x27;s office to return the premises of the shelters that were illegally withdrawn from the ownership of the communities. To date, more than 400 such lawsuits have been filed across the country, and the work continues. Prime Minister Shmyhal also reported on the difficult situation with bridges and bridge crossings. The largest cities, including Kyiv. The situation is downright dangerous. The National Security and Defense Council has decided to set up a commission to inspect all bridges and overpasses across the country. Deputy Prime Minister Kubrakov is responsible for the inspection. The second point on the agenda is courts. Deputy Prime Minister Stefanishyna informed the NSDC of the European Commission&#x27;s interim verbal assessment of our institutional progress, particularly with regard to judicial reform. Indeed, a lot has been done. But we consider this only as a necessary basis for our own obligations to Ukrainians in terms of justice. Obviously, the case of the former President of the Supreme Court and other similar situations in the judicial system require a stricter state policy regarding the requirements for judges, for all those who work in the justice system, and their accountability for violations. For corruption violations. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine appealed to the National Security and Defense Council. Today we considered the appeal. The Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, Ruslan Stefanchuk, and the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Policy, Mr. Maslov, delivered reports. So, here are the proposals. To increase criminal liability for corruption offenses in the judiciary. And to make it tangible. From 10 to 15 years with confiscation of property. And this should apply to those who extort money, who take money, who maintain this system of corruption at all its levels. Next. There should be integrity checks of judges. And not only before appointment. Time can, unfortunately, change people about whom there was a positive conclusion at the beginning of their work in the courts. And I believe that it is worth checking, including with the use of a polygraph. Very importantly, we need to strengthen the role of the jury and expand the number of cases of its use in Ukraine. This is not only about democracy, it is about ensuring more justice. We also discussed the issue of protecting the rights of business and investors in courts. This is a fundamental task. A strong economy means secured investments and guaranteed protection of property rights. And it should be ensured. If we need a separate mechanism to protect business and investors&#x27; rights, we must ensure it. We have relevant proposals. Of course, we discussed the tasks that must be completed by the end of the year in order to fully implement each of the European Commission&#x27;s recommendations for the start of negotiations on joining the European Union. The National Security and Defense Council gave the necessary protocol instructions in each of these areas. I am confident that all of them can be fulfilled. Today is exactly one year since Ukraine has become a candidate for accession to the European Union, and this year the goal is to start membership negotiations. Ukraine will definitely do its part. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>May Ukraine&#x27;s victory and state institutions&#x27; successful transformation be best tribute to memory of all our heroes – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-23</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! The summary of this busy day. The meeting based on the results of the London Ukraine Recovery Conference is a powerful event, good gains for our country. The support from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union is crucial. Long-term support programs for the future, for years to come. About five hundred global companies, strong companies, are interested in investing in Ukraine. Clear support for Ukraine&#x27;s EU membership: we are already perceived as an EU member politically. Separately, we are working on the mechanism for the confiscation of the assets of the terrorist state and its associated persons. I thank everyone who prepared the conference and participated in its work, it is really important. A very meaningful meeting of the National Security and Defense Council today. I have already reported on it separately. I just held a Supreme Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Staff meeting. Justice is also a very important point of our discussion at the Staff meeting. Issues concerning military commission chiefs, in particular the scandal with... a figure in Odesa. This person should definitely not be in the recruitment system of the Armed Forces, it is very unpleasant, frankly immoral, and wrong that this person remained in his position despite everything. I&#x27;ve instructed Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny to remove this person from his post. And First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Pavliuk has been instructed to organize an inspection of this entire system of military commissions. It is a pity that the Staff meeting&#x27;s attention and time now have to be spent on such issues. Of course, the situation on the front line was discussed in great detail – all the main directions, ammunition supply, artillery... Everything that requires the Staff&#x27;s attention today. Commanders – Generals Zaluzhny, Syrsky, Tarnavsky, Moskalyov, Vice-Admiral Neizhpapa, General Malyuk, and government officials reported to the meeting. All. I had the honor to congratulate the officers of our military educational institutions on their graduation... Six higher education institutions at once. Kharkiv National University of the Air Force, Military Institute of Tank Troops of Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute, Military Institute of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Kruty Heroes Military Institute of Telecommunications and Informatization, Ukrainian Military Medical Academy and the Department of Military Training of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine. I thank each and every one who chooses to be a Ukrainian officer, and I wish for two absolutely fundamental things: to destroy the occupiers as much as possible and win as soon as possible. And two more things. Today, the Civil Service Day is celebrated in our country. The day of those people without whose integrity there is no effective state. Of course, we still have a lot to do so that the civil service in Ukraine gets closer to the models we are aiming for in our policy. But now I want to thank all our people who, under the existing conditions and with the available resources in the state, are doing everything that depends on them to make the state effective. Thank you! To each and every one! And I congratulate you on the Civil Service Day of Ukraine. And, of course, the front. Knowing our heroes, and being grateful to them is a must. Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the soldiers of our 35th Separate Marine Brigade. A brigade that performs extremely difficult tasks. Guys who fight exactly the way Ukrainian soldiers should fight. Senior sailor Viacheslav Imanhulov and junior lieutenant Serhiy Penov – thank you, guys, for your exemplary strength and courage in the battles in Donetsk region. That&#x27;s what our soldiers, Ukrainian soldiers, need to be. Well done! And I ask each and every one: please honor the memory of our two paratroopers of the 35th Brigade. Especially brave, especially strong. They gave their lives for our state, for our people right now – in the battles in June, and Ukraine must remember them. Captain Ivan Kotsur... Eternal memory! Senior Lieutenant Oleksandr Kazandzhi... Eternal memory! May Ukraine&#x27;s victory in this war and the successful transformation of our state institutions into ones as strong and effective as our soldiers are – may this be the best tribute to the memory of all our heroes of different times who fought and died for Ukraine&#x27;s freedom and strength! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine will definitely be able to protect Europe from any Russian forces, and it doesn&#x27;t matter who commands them – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-24</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, all the people of the world, good health to you! Today is a day when there definitely should be no silence. And we definitely need leadership. Today the world saw that the bosses of Russia do not control anything. Nothing at all. Complete chaos. Complete absence of any predictability. And it is happening on Russian territory, which is fully loaded with weapons. We all remember how the head of Russia threatened the world in 2021. He had some ultimatums, he was trying to show a kind of strength... The year 2022 showed that he confused – confused his illusions and the lies he was fed with strength. They in the Kremlin are capable of resorting to any terror, capable of resorting to any stupidity, but they cannot provide even one percent of the necessary control. And they are the real problem. In one day, they lost several of their million-plus cities and showed all Russian bandits, mercenaries, oligarchs and anyone else how easy it is to capture Russian cities and, probably, arsenals with weapons. Now, it is very important that no one in the world remains silent because of being afraid of this Russian chaos. All the actions of the leaders now can be historic. Every word of journalists is worth its weight in gold. It is necessary to clearly name the source of the problem. And if someone in the world tries to ignore the situation, if someone in the world is under the illusion that the Kremlin is capable of regaining control... this only postpones the problem until the next breakthrough of chaos – even more dangerous. We all know the solution. First, the world should not be afraid. We know that only our unity protects us. Ukraine will definitely be able to protect Europe from any Russian forces, and it doesn&#x27;t matter who commands them. We will protect. The security of Europe&#x27;s eastern flank depends only on our defense. And that is why every manifestation of support for our defense is support for your defense, everyone in the free world. Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian guns, Ukrainian tanks, Ukrainian missiles are all that protect Europe from such marches as we see today on Russian territory. And when we ask to give us the F-16 fighters or the ATACMS, we&#x27;re enhancing our common defense. Real defense. This is what is needed. Now is the time to provide all the weapons necessary for defense. Second, everything must be real. It&#x27;s time for everyone in the world to frankly say that all of Russia&#x27;s criminal actions against Ukraine were and are unprovoked. And we all have to focus exclusively on our common security priorities. NATO is not just a word or a set of formal promises. These are reliable guarantees for everyone that peace won&#x27;t be destroyed. Without Ukraine, such guarantees are worthless. Already in July at the summit in Vilnius, it is a historic chance for real decisions without looking back at Russia. Any nation that borders Russia really supports this. And the third... I will say it in Russian. The man from the Kremlin is obviously very afraid and probably hiding somewhere, not showing himself. I am sure that he is no longer in Moscow. He calls somewhere, and asks something... He knows what he is afraid of because he himself created this threat. All evil, all losses, all hatred – he himself who spreads it. And the longer he can run between his bunkers, the more you all will lose... all who are connected with Russia. What will we, Ukrainians, do? We will defend our country. We will defend our freedom. We will not be silent and we will not be inactive. We know how to win – and it will happen. Our victory in this war will definitely be. And what will you do? The longer your troops stay on Ukrainian land, the more devastation they will bring to Russia. The longer this person is in the Kremlin, the more disasters there will be. And now I&#x27;m switching to my native language. Thanks to our soldiers! Thanks to everyone who is now beating the occupiers! Thanks to the Air Force for protecting our skies! Glory to Ukraine! We will defeat everyone!</p>

  <h2>It is right for our people, our children to know to whom we owe our lives and freedom of Ukraine - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-06-25</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! I would like to dedicate this address primarily to our warriors. To all those who are fighting in the most difficult battles, to all those who are leading this war to Ukraine&#x27;s victory. Of course, I&#x27;ll focus on the Tavria units - the ones that did the biggest amount of work at the front this week. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades. Thank you, guys! The 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Brigadier General Marko Bezruchko. Thank you, warriors! Artillerymen of the 55th Zaporizhzhia Sich brigade. I am proud of you, and it is an honor for me every time to celebrate you, our heroes! Paratroopers of the 79th separate brigade - again and again I thank you guys for your extraordinary strength! The 128th separate mountain assault brigade of Zakarpattia... Thank you, warriors! Thank you for each of your results for Ukraine! Today I would like to personally recognize Senior Lieutenant Ivan Hrysiuk, Junior Sergeant Mykola Komisar and Soldier Volodymyr Kononuchenko. Thank you for your strength and precision! Our border guards. The Kramatorsk, Lviv and Donetsk border guard detachments and the troops of the Dozor mobile border guard detachment. I thank all of you! And I would like to especially mention Senior Sergeant Oleksandr Koprovsky from the air reconnaissance group, Senior Soldier Viktor Polishchuk, and Soldier Roman Borys. Thank you, guys! Our National Guard. The 4th operational brigade of the National Guard. It is fighting in Donetsk region. Thank you, warriors! In particular, I would like to mention the aerial reconnaissance men - Senior Soldier Oleksandr Pohorenyi and Soldier Maksym Bobruyenko. Your skills, guys, are very helpful! And I would like all our people, each and every one in Ukraine, to thank our warriors in this way - personally. To your family and friends who are at the front. To your acquaintances. To those you have heard about. Those you follow on social media. Those whose families you know. Please thank, support and tell your friends, your children and people around the world about our warriors. Our warriors deserve it. They are real heroes. And one more thing. From time to time my son comes to my office. From time to time, but nevertheless. And he is most interested here in these chevrons. Military personnel, volunteers, relatives of our soldiers handed them to me. At the front and in Kyiv, in hospitals, during the award ceremonies for heroes in the Mariyinsky Palace. The number of chevrons on the chevron board is growing, but very slowly, as every time Kyrylo takes them away. And I am happy that he is interested in this. Our heroes, our defense, Ukrainian chevrons. A long time ago I wanted to make a special series of posts in my social networks about these chevrons. About where they came from. Who gave them to me. What these units are. And today, we will start issuing such posts. Maybe someone else wants to talk about the chevrons you have. I think that it is right. It is right for our people, our children to know to whom we owe our lives and Ukraine’s freedom. Thank you, warriors! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>
