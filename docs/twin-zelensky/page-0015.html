  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine on the Day of Dignity and Freedom</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-21</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today we celebrate the Day of Dignity and Freedom. A holiday that shows that for us dignity and freedom is a holiday. The answer to the question of who Ukrainians are and what is most important to them. Dear people! I said these words in the same place on the same day exactly one year ago. What has changed since then? A lot. In our country, Europe and the whole world. But something remains unchanged. This is the answer to the question of who Ukrainians are and what is most important to us. Two values, inextricably intertwined, like the right and left banks of the Dnipro River. Like blue and yellow colors. Like Chubynsky’s words and Verbytsky’s music. Like two threads of a pattern on a vyshyvanka where our genetic code is encrypted. This is dignity and freedom. We always remembered this and have no right to forget. We always valued this and are not afraid to defend this. We always knew what we wanted. And this year, everyone found out what we are capable of. Friends and enemies saw it. Allies and partners. We saw for ourselves. Someone - once again. Someone - for the first time. But all together we proved and continue to prove that dignity and freedom are a holiday for us. This remained unchanged. And everyone saw what Ukrainians are capable of. Everyone saw what defenders we have. How to hold out against one of the greatest armies in the world and become one of the best armies in the world. Someone will say: it sounds loud. Yes. Our army sounds loud. For the last eight years. And for the last nine months. When hardened fighters are joined by musicians, actors, Olympic champions, IT specialists, scientists, businessmen. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who did not get on the plane, but stood in line at the military commissariat. And side by side they stood up for our dream. Free Ukraine forever. And everyone saw what our civilians are capable of. Everyone saw what kind of citizens we have! How can you become a living wall on the path of the occupier&#x27;s military columns, stop and turn around enemy tanks and armored personnel carriers with bare hands. Go to rallies under the occupation despite the gunshots and stun grenades. Preserve the Ukrainian flag and wait to finally meet the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Flood your village to prevent the orcs from entering Kyiv. Shoot down a Russian drone with a can. Give seeds to the occupiers so that sunflowers sprout in the place where they perish. And everyone saw what kind of doctors, firefighters, rescuers, railway workers, energy workers, and farmers we have. How can you be on duty for several weeks in a row. Pull dozens of wounded from the battlefield. Carry out surgeries under bombs and bullets. Sow a crop and gather it as a harvest under bombs and bullets. Give lectures to students online, in the trenches. Get a bachelor&#x27;s degree online, in the trenches. Everyone saw what kind of volunteers and caring people we have. How can you raise funds for drones, ambulance vehicles, optics, thermal imagers in a matter of hours. How to get everything. Buy everything. Bring everything. And then get, buy and bring again, because that wasn&#x27;t all. And in every village, people canned borscht and stewed meat for the frontline, because we would go red with embarrassment if our warriors ate expired dry ration, like orcs. We are willing to give the last we have so that the Ukrainian warrior looks decently. Fights decently. Wins decently. And everyone saw what kind of business we have. Not oligarchs, but a modern, creative, humane and responsible business. How to turn your office, hotel or gym into a shelter for IDPs. How fashion shoe brands manufacture army boots. Designers of women&#x27;s dresses manufacture body armor. A garden furniture manufacturer makes anti-tank hedgehogs. A famous model cooks food for warriors and refugees. A TV presenter makes a &quot;Bandera smoothie&quot;. A doctor of science sorts humanitarian aid in Poland. And an opera singer evacuates hundreds of people in his car. Everyone saw what kind of children we have. How they give up smartphones and gadgets to donate money to the army. How they wash cars and sell drawings, collecting money for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. How a boy runs away from home to enroll in the territorial defense. How a girl with shot legs drives a car 15 kilometers to take out four wounded adults. Everyone saw what kind of people we have! Willing to give the last. Willing to stand to the last. They did not lose dignity. Bravery. Faith in themselves. And they united. In order not to lose freedom. Not to lose independence. Not to lose Ukraine. We can be left without money. Without gasoline. Without hot water. Without light. But not without freedom. And it remains unchanged. Yes, we have paid and continue to pay a very high price for freedom. And we will never forget all those who gave their lives for Ukraine. And we will never forgive everyone who took away their lives and wanted to take away our freedom. But the main thing is that no one succeeded and no one will ever succeed. Dear people! I said these words in the same place on the same day exactly one year ago. What has changed since then? A lot. Craters appeared on our land. There are roadblocks and anti-tank hedgehogs in our cities and villages. It may be dark on our streets. It may be cold in our homes. There are many changes, but they have not changed the most important thing. Because the most important thing is not outside, but inside. And it remains unchanged. And that&#x27;s why we will hold out. We will endure. Everyone. Different. But Ukrainian men and women. Defenders. Everyone who knows: we must be worthy, we must not give up. Because Ukrainians are not used to giving up. Because they have dignity. And therefore - freedom! This remains unchanged. We will overcome everything. Endure. Survive. Prevail! And on the Day of Dignity and Freedom, we will gather on Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Where dignity and freedom have always been protected. On the granite, on the barricades during the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity. Where we celebrated the 30th anniversary of Ukraine&#x27;s independence. And where we will celebrate the Victory Day of Ukraine. In a peaceful Kyiv, in a peaceful Ukraine, I will speak about the important. About the main thing. What remained unchanged. And will remain unchanged. Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must remain principled in countering Russian aggression, joint action is true peacekeeping - speech by the President of Ukraine at the annual session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-21</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mr. President of the Assembly! Dear attendees! Dear representatives of Spain and all other countries of the Alliance! Dear friends! I am glad to see you and thank you for all the kind words that have just been spoken and will be spoken in the Assembly in our support - in support of the struggle for freedom. Today, Ukraine marks the ninth anniversary of the beginning of Maidan - the Revolution of Dignity. In those months of 2013-2014, when Ukrainians in the squares and streets of our cities defended the right to European choice for our state, an important thing happened for our entire community - a community of nations united by the values of freedom, respect for law, democracy and diversity. Ukrainians filled with a powerful life force what many began to think was just a bureaucratic formality. Ukrainians and all people in Europe, in America, in the world, who supported us and continue to support us, filled the flag of the European Union with new energy. And in fact, with the way we defend freedom in Ukraine, we united both the European Union and NATO. We showed the commonality of challenges and proved the commonality of values. Ladies and Gentlemen! Although Ukraine has not yet become a full-fledged part of the EU and NATO, I am addressing you on behalf of the people who have always been, are and will be part of the valuable space to which you all belong. History brought us to different sides of ideological walls. But the walls fell, and our values are all preserved. And not only me, but millions of our people and the majority of citizens of your states support the European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine. Now, when we are defending European values not in the squares and streets, but on the battlefield in a full-scale war, it is absolutely obvious how unfair and unnatural Ukraine&#x27;s alienation from Europe was. We will not leave a single percent of that alienation. I urge you to do everything in your power so that our community of nations - nations of values - will never again be divided or weakened! All of you see what endangers us. All of us! All who cannot imagine their life without freedom. All of you can see Ukraine’s significant contribution to the protection of our community. Everyone sees how important it is that we really united in defense after February 24. So, due to this, you also see that Ukraine should become a full member of the European Union and NATO. And I urge you to support our applications for membership in the EU and the Alliance! Ukrainians do not just believe - Ukrainians are sure that we can defend ourselves in this war and return the borders of a united Europe to the entire length of our eastern and southern borders. Ukrainians do not just believe - Ukrainians know that the strength of our democracy will be a guarantee that no tyranny to the east of us will be able to threaten Europe. But in order to realize all these years, to realize all this, we have to use all the strength of our community, all the potential of our cooperation in order to gradually stop this terrorist Russian war and restore peace. That is why I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula. All points of our Peace Formula are beyond doubt. Every nation in our community is interested in ensuring that no dangerous incidents occur at nuclear facilities. We all want Russian terrorists to no longer be able to take people&#x27;s lives. Each of our states needs guaranteed protection against any Russian missiles and any sabotage against infrastructure facilities. We are all interested in the stability of energy, food and other markets. We all strive for international law to retain its force and actually work. Each of us considers it fair that those guilty of war crimes, deportations and any manifestations of genocidal policy should be brought to justice. We all wish there would be no burnt cities and ruins instead of a normal life anywhere in Europe. All this is ensured by the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which, without being mistaken, can be called both the European peace formula and the world peace formula, as it is built on respect and protection of universal human values, on international law. From nuclear safety to the restoration of our territorial integrity, from the Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine to countering ecocide - everything is envisaged in our Formula. Dear friends! I suggest that you and your countries choose the point of the peace formula in which you can show your leadership. Joint action is what constitutes true peacemaking. And while we concentrate our forces to implement this Formula, we must maintain one hundred percent principled position in countering Russian aggression. Russia has bet on a genocidal policy, and that is why it is destroying our energy infrastructure. To &quot;kill&quot; electricity, water and heat supply in winter - and this is Russia&#x27;s goal - is to put the lives of millions of people in direct danger. This is equivalent to the use of weapons of mass destruction - an absolute crime. Therefore, it will be right if you in your parliaments designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, as the parliaments of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic have done. It will be right if your countries constantly strengthen sanctions against Russia, which has become the complete opposite of our community and the most anti-European power in the world. It is the constant strengthening of sanctions that will not allow the terrorist state to adapt and find new ways of ensuring its terror. A new, ninth sanctions package of the European Union is needed, new world sanctions against Russia for terror - immediately after limiting export prices for Russian energy resources. It will be right if we prevent Russia&#x27;s key terrorist plan and provide Ukraine with full protection of the sky. When Russian missiles, Iranian drones, and any other instruments of terror fail to reach their intended targets, Russia will have to do what we need, namely, follow our Peace Formula. We can ensure this! But for this, Ukraine needs to be provided with a sufficient number and quality of air defense and missile defense systems. With a sufficient weight of defense and financial support. The terrorist state must see that it stands no chance. Since 2013 and until today, Ukrainians, with the support of our friends, have demonstrated that nothing is impossible for us when we are truly united and defend our unconditional values. So, let&#x27;s maintain our unity! And let’s fight for freedom! I thank all of you for your support! Long live freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We now have a historic opportunity to protect the Ukrainian freedom once and for all - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-21</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, it should be said that today is the professional holiday of our paratroopers - the Day of Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I&#x27;m in a relevant gift. The boys handed it over and asked to wear it. It’s my pleasure! In particular, this is the day of the 25th Sicheslav Separate Airborne Brigade, the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, the 81st Separate Airmobile Brigade and the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, which distinguished themselves during the liberation of the Kharkiv region and our other lands. This is the day of the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade, which took part in the liberation of Kherson and the occupied territories of the left bank of Ukraine. The day of the 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, which extremely bravely defends our state in the Luhansk region and the Donetsk region. This is the day of units of the 132nd Іeparate Reconnaissance Battalion, which took part in the liberation of the Zhytomyr region and Kyiv region together with other units of the Airborne Assault Troops. The day of the warriors of the 148th Separate Artillery Division who every day accurately &quot;subtract&quot; the enemy in the most threatening areas of the front. This is the day of the 71st Separate Hunting Brigade, which became part of the Airborne Assault Troops recently, but has already proven itself well. I thank you all, warriors! Thank you to all Ukrainian paratroopers! In the morning, in the White Hall of the Heroes of Ukraine in the Mariyinsky Palace, I had the honor of presenting awards on the occasion of the professional holiday to the best fighters. I handed over the Gold Star Orders to the relatives of our Heroes who gave their lives for Ukraine. Our Airborne Assault Troops, like all the Defense Forces of Ukraine, pay an extremely high price for our people to preserve their freedom. Thousands of Ukrainian men and women died fighting for our country. We should always remember them. We must always honor their courage and self-sacrifice. I spoke today about Ukraine&#x27;s contribution to the protection of freedom and European values in an address to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. I called on the countries of the Alliance to take specific actions to implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which can reliably guarantee peace and justice for Ukraine and the entire Euro-Atlantic community. I also called on all parliaments of NATO member states to finally adopt a decision on designating Russia as a terrorist state. I believe that gradually we will reach this result - this is how Russia will be perceived in the world. Exactly what it has become. A terrorist state. And I thank all the members of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, who today adopted the relevant resolution to confirm this and our other positions. Today I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron about the implementation of several points of our Peace Formula at once. Namely, about radiation safety and the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as well as about the energy security of Ukraine and Europe. We are working to ensure the implementation of the IAEA order to stop any hostile activity against Ukrainian nuclear facilities. And for this, the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is extremely important. Russia must withdraw all its militants from there and stop shelling the station. I am grateful to Mr. President Macron for his willingness to support the protection of our energy facilities. We are also doing everything to make the conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine and the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan, in which France is ready to show leadership, as effective as possible. Today, our energy workers had to apply not only stabilizing shutdowns, but also unscheduled ones. This is caused by a higher level of consumption than the country can provide at this time. Therefore, I would like to appeal to all representatives of regional authorities and local communities: please do not stop communicating about the rational consumption of electricity. Of course, energy workers, utility workers, rescuers and everyone involved are working at their maximum. But the systemic damage to our energy sphere by the attacks of Russian terrorists is so significant that all our people and businesses should be very frugal and spread consumption by hours of the day. As of this evening, the situation is particularly difficult in Kyiv and the region, as well as in the Vinnytsia, Sumy, Ternopil, Cherkasy, Odesa regions and some other cities and districts. Please try to limit your personal use of electricity in areas where there is the most difficulty on a daily basis, and especially during peak consumption hours. Of course, there should be a very frugal approach in public places as well. And one more thing. Today is the ninth anniversary of the beginning of Maidan - the Revolution of Dignity. Ninth... But the freedom and dignity of the Ukrainian people is more than a thousand years old. It is worth remembering this. There were many threats to the freedom of our people and the very existence of Ukrainians. But the people got through it. And now we have a historic opportunity to defend Ukrainian freedom once and for all. I believe that it will be so. I thank everyone who supports our country! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Eternal glory and honor to all those who gave their lives for the freedom of our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Aid to Ukraine today is not just a matter of equipment, it is protection against terror - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the 104th Congress of Mayors and Heads of Municipalities of France</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear friends! It is an honor for me to address the Congress of Mayors, which unites now and always many leaders of French society. I know that I will be heard by senators and deputies of the French parliament, government ministers, prefects, heads of cities and municipalities, the President of the French Republic. You represent millions of French citizens, and I want to explain today what is most important now for millions of Ukrainians. I will be as specific as possible. The Russian war hit the entire territory of Ukraine, but the occupiers temporarily managed to seize part of the territory of ten of our regions. What are the 10 regions of Ukraine? These are more than 11,000 settlements. Of these 11 thousand, just imagine, the total number of cities and villages of Ukraine that came under occupation is more than three thousand seven hundred. These are big cities and small towns. Both ancient powerful settlements and villages with only a few houses. It was a very different life. But now we see one thing in all these settlements - a complete lack of any opportunities to live normally and freely. We managed to liberate more than 1,800 settlements from the Russian occupation. And the consequences of the occupation are very similar everywhere. The Russian soldiers mined everything they managed to mine. The occupiers looted everything they managed to loot. In general, hundreds of thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged by shelling across Ukraine. Thousands of social objects. The occupiers leave behind a completely destroyed infrastructure... Imagine what it is like - people under the occupation have lived without communication, electricity, normal water supply for six months. I will give an example of one city - Kherson. This is a city in the south of Ukraine. Regional center, port. Kherson, like the entire region, has become a new home for many residents of Crimea who left the peninsula after its capture by Russia in 2014. The Russian army occupied Kherson in the spring of this year. On November 11, the liberation of the city began. What did we see in it? Of the three hundred thousand citizens who lived in Kherson before, about one hundred thousand remained in the city. They had nothing. There was no electricity or communication. There was no water. Only after our return did pharmacies start working in the city. We are resuming the work of the medical sphere, the provision of social services. The Russian military did not just rob people, taking away everything valuable... They broke or destroyed all equipment that could work to restore communication and supplies for people, for example, heat in the winter. They mined administrative buildings, and some of them simply have to be blown up, because it is impossible to demine them without risking the lives of sappers. Kherson has always been a peaceful and tranquil southern city. Now we will have to spend years to heal its wounds after the Russian occupation. And in general, there are still about two thousand towns and villages that we still have to liberate and restore. At least dozens of them were completely destroyed by the strikes of the Russian army - like Mariupol or Volnovakha. Dear friends! When Ukraine asks for help in this war, it is not just about the clash of states - it is not just about the fact that Russia has come to take our land and our resources, which it wants to appropriate. This is a clash of two opposite attitudes towards people and towards life. When Russia comes to a city, nothing is left of normal life there. Russia brings repression and abuse, takes not just property from people... There are thousands of examples, in particular, of how the Russian military simply destroyed residential buildings or cars on the roads. There are thousands of proofs that mining and destroying energy, medical, educational and other infrastructure in Ukraine is a deliberate Russian policy. They want Ukrainians to simply not be able to live on this land. When the Ukrainian flag returns to the liberated territory, we do everything so that normal life returns with it. The same life you are used to in your cities. That is why Ukraine is so grateful to everyone who supports us - our defense, finances, reconstruction. It is literally a life saving aid. Now, on the eve of winter, we are facing one of the greatest threats since the beginning of all-out war. Russian missile terror destroyed almost half of our energy infrastructure. And we know that the Kremlin has set the task of continuing the attacks on energy facilities. To turn the cold of winter into a weapon of mass destruction. With this, Russia wants to do to the entire territory of Ukraine what it is doing to the occupied cities and villages. It wants to destroy life. Of course, we oppose that. Just yesterday, I spoke with President Emmanuel Macron about what we can do together to defend against these Russian tactics. We have clear agreements. In particular, about holding in early December a conference on the rapid reconstruction of Ukraine already now - in accordance with our Plan for the rapid recovery of Ukraine. And I invite all of you to join the Conference and related efforts. I invite you to also contact the Embassy of Ukraine in France to find out what other options of help exist. In order to get through this winter and not allow Russia to turn the cold into a tool of terror and subjugation, we need many things - from generators of various capacities to Starlinks. For us, this is not just a matter of equipment. For Ukraine, this is protection against terror. Just like help with demining or equipment for firefighters and rescuers, for our doctors, which is already provided at the level of French cities and municipalities, the provision of generators and specific communication systems is an absolutely clear protection of people. I urge you to be very specific as well! Specific in help. And to support the protection of our cities and communities against terror. Together we can definitely do it. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Across the country, we are rolling out a new &quot;Points of Invincibility&quot; project to support people - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-22</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We have some much needed financial news today. First, there is another tranche of macro-financial aid from the European Union worth 2.5 billion euros. It is very important. We are also waiting for the approval of the macro-financial aid program for the next year in the amount of 18 billion euros. Second, the United States of America has announced that it will soon provide $4.5 billion in additional funding to directly support our budget. I am grateful to the partners for these important steps of solidarity. Due to such decisions of our friends, we maintain social stability and, despite all the Russian strikes, fulfill our social obligations. And these are obligations to millions of people. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, we have been making stable payments to pensioners - that&#x27;s almost 11 million older Ukrainians. Indexation of pensions was carried out, as provided by law. 6 million citizens have some form of social support. This month alone, social payments totaled almost 14 billion hryvnias. This is assistance to those with many children, the poor, single mothers, and people with disabilities. Also more than 2 million internally displaced persons receive assistance from the state. Plus salaries for employees of the budget sector. We do everything to ensure payments for all our defenders. The financial frontline for Ukraine is now as important as the frontline on the battlefield. And I thank everyone who helps our state accumulate the necessary funds. Both to our friends in the world and to businesses that, despite everything, continue to work and pay taxes. As for the energy frontline. Energy and utility workers in many regions continue restoration of the network. We are also preparing responses to possible new terrorist attacks against our energy system. As of this evening, only stabilizing shutdown schedules are used in 16 regions and in Kyiv. But we must understand that in case of consumption spikes, emergency shutdowns are also possible. We are also rolling out our new &quot;Points of Invincibility&quot; project to support people across the country. As of this day, more than 4,000 such points have already been prepared. More are planned. If massive Russian strikes take place again and if there is an understanding that the electricity supply cannot be restored within hours, the work of &quot;Points of Invincibility&quot; will be activated - all basic services will be there, including electricity, mobile communications and the Internet, heat, water, and a first-aid kit. Absolutely free and 24/7. Points will necessarily work at all regional and district administrations, as well as at schools, buildings of the State Emergency Service, etc. A special website, nezlamnist.gov.ua, with a map of such points throughout the country is already available. It is constantly updated. It&#x27;s important to see now where these points are in your city, in your community, and keep an eye on the map for updates in the coming weeks as new points are added. On the website and in all &quot;Points of Invincibility&quot; you will be able to find out where the nearest gas station, bank, pharmacy and grocery store are operating. All of us must be prepared for any scenario, considering what terrorists are fighting against our people and what they are trying to do. Local authorities are tasked with informing people about the existence of &quot;Points of Invincibility&quot;. It should be very simple: in government buildings, in pharmacies, grocery stores, in post offices, there should be information about where a person can find support in the event of a long-term power outage. And it is very important that conscientious business is already joining this initiative of ours. Thanks to all the entrepreneurs who decided to support society now and make their business facilities also &quot;Points of Invincibility&quot; - with generators, Starlinks, water and other stuff. And please note that on our website nezlamnist.gov.ua there is a special form for business representatives who want to join and become a &quot;Point of Invincibility&quot; for Ukrainians. I am sure: by helping each other, we will all be able to get through this winter together. The situation on the frontline has not changed over the past day. In all areas of the front, the same dynamics as in the previous days is maintained. Donetsk region - fierce attacks, constant shelling. I thank all our heroes, who courageously hold out despite everything! Luhansk region - with battles yet little by little we are strengthening our position and moving forward little by little. Kherson region and other territories of the south - we are doing everything to reduce the combat potential of the occupiers and eliminate their ability to carry out shelling of our cities. Step by step, we will bring the Russian army to new defeats, and no shelling of Kherson or any of our cities will help the occupiers. The sea... On our United24 fundraising platform, we are actively raising funds for naval drones. Unity, as always, gives a great result. Ordinary people. More than 50 Ukrainian companies. International businesses. Plus our Lithuanian friends. Plus the IT community. In total, people from 93 countries joined this initiative of ours! We are gradually building the Ukrainian fleet of naval drones! I thank everyone who supports us! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps loved ones get through this difficult time! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine proposes to adopt a resolution condemning energy terror - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the meeting of the UN Security Council convened after the missile strikes of the Russian Federation</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-24</span></div>
  <p>Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen! We expect a strong reaction from the world to today&#x27;s Russian terror. We expect the reaction of partners. We expect the reaction of friends - not just observers. We expect the reaction of all those who really recognize the UN Charter. We are doing everything possible. Ukraine presented the Peace Formula. The world heard it. 10 points - how to restore the full power of the UN Charter violated by Russia, and guarantee the safety of Ukraine, the safety of Europe and all the peoples of the planet who suffer from the consequences of Russian aggression. In response to our Peace Formula, Russia is following the steps of its formula of terror. The very next day after I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula at the G19 summit in Indonesia, we received ten Russian missiles per each point of the Peace Formula. The strikes continued. We liberated Kherson - and as soon as the Russian army fled from there, it began to methodically destroy this city. Strikes every day. This night – another missile attack on the Zaporizhzhia region, on the hospital – on the buildings where the maternity ward was located. Russian terrorists took the life of a baby - the child was 2 days old when it was killed by a Russian missile! And then again - dead, dead, dozens of wounded. In the city of Vyshhorod this afternoon, a residential building was hit, 35 people were injured, 4 were killed. This is one of the main points of the Russian formula of terror - missiles. Only today - almost 70 missiles. Against our energy infrastructure. Unfortunately, a residential building was also hit. Hospitals, schools, transport, residential areas - everything was affected. Russian terror led to a blackout – and not only in Ukraine. The light also went out in neighboring Moldova. But the understanding of what Russia wants to achieve with such strikes should not disappear anywhere in the world. Energy terror is an analogue of the use of weapons of mass destruction. When the temperature is below zero outside, and tens of millions of people are left without electricity, heat and water as a result of Russian missiles hitting energy facilities, this is an obvious crime against humanity. Ladies and Gentlemen! Among you are representatives of a state that offers nothing to the world except terror, destabilization and disinformation. Any Russian formulas do not provide for anything else. And that&#x27;s why I emphasize once again - it&#x27;s time to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula! There must be no opportunity left for terror in the world! That is why we are turning to our partners for support to protect our skies. We need modern and effective air defense and missile defense systems, and I thank everyone who is already helping. What can a representative of a terrorist state tell you now? That civilians do not suffer from their missiles? Everything is obvious. It&#x27;s all too obvious. And I urge you to take concrete steps to protect humanity and life! Russia has long been trying to turn the UN Security Council into a platform for rhetoric. But the Security Council was created as the world&#x27;s most powerful platform for decisions and actions. This is what we can demonstrate. The Security Council should provide a clear assessment of the actions of the terrorist state in accordance with Chapter Seven of the UN Charter. Ukraine proposes that the Security Council adopt such a resolution condemning any forms of energy terror. Let&#x27;s see if anyone in the world will be able to say, along with Russia, that terror against civilians is supposedly a good thing. I confirm the invitation from Ukraine regarding the mission of UN experts to critical infrastructure facilities of our country that have been or may be hit by Russian missiles. It is necessary to give a proper assessment of damage and destruction. It should be stated that these are strikes against the very infrastructure that ensures the lives of tens of millions of people. And finally, justice must be restored within the UN structures themselves. The terrorist state should not participate in any voting on the issues of its aggression, its terror. It is a stalemate when the one who caused the war, the one responsible for the terror, blocks any attempt by the UN Security Council to fulfill its mandate. This is nonsense that the veto right is reserved for the one who is waging a criminal war. It is necessary to lead the world out of this impasse. It is absolutely possible. The world should not be held hostage by one international terrorist. Russia is doing everything to make the electric generator a more powerful and necessary tool than the UN Charter. We must and can return real meaning to all things - and above all to the UN Charter. Your decisions are needed! Thank you for the opportunity! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Energy workers, utility workers, State Emergency Service will work round the clock; we are gradually connecting new and new districts - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-24</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Indomitable people of an indomitable country! I’ve just addressed the UN Security Council and called for a reaction. Reaction to Russian terror. One seat in the Security Council is still occupied, and they tried to say something from there. I am sure that no one in the world wants to hear Russian lies anymore. In reality, this chair is empty. Today, the European Parliament recognized Russia as a terrorist state and called on the EU and member states to create a legal framework so that such a recognition works at the national level throughout Europe and has consequences – precisely legal consequences, not just political ones. And Russia - as if the whole world does not matter - continued its missile attacks today. The United States of America has announced another package of support in the amount of 400 million dollars. Everything necessary so that we can protect the life and freedom of our people. And Russia used missiles for another attack on another hospital and killed... a baby. Life that lasted only two days was cut short. Today, we are deploying Points of Invincibility across the country to support our people. To provide heat, electricity and communication. And Russia spends 67 missiles to hit the very basis of life of any people anywhere in Ukraine and provokes a blackout in Ukraine. When I received reports in the evening on the progress of power restoration, 11 regions were marked &quot;the entire region is without electricity&quot;. As of the beginning of the night, we are gradually connecting new and new districts. Energy workers, utility workers, and State Emergency Service will work round the clock. The Kyiv region - the connection of household consumers has begun, 20% are already connected. The Chernihiv region is in a difficult situation, but we are looking for opportunities to provide electricity to people. The Cherkasy region - all critical infrastructure is working, we are doing everything to return energy to household consumers. The Odesa region - water supply is 100% connected, heat - 100%, household electricity consumers - still few, only 10%. But there should be more by morning. Volyn - tens of thousands of consumers are connected, we are working on all others. The Ternopil region - we are connecting district by district. The Lviv region was completely turned off. As of now, 90% are connected. Kyiv is in a very difficult situation. Work will continue throughout the night. We expect the result by tomorrow, in the first half of the day. It is the same in all other cities and communities that were affected or were left without energy. We are doing everything for the people. And the occupiers are doing everything to make people suffer, so that we can&#x27;t even hear and see each other. Today, our team managed to bring home another 36 Ukrainians. 35 servicemen, one civilian. Two officers, 33 privates and sergeants. In spite of everything, we are saving our people and we will certainly return all the prisoners and deportees. This shows everything very clearly - about us and about them. It shows everything very accurately. The Russian occupiers still haven’t understood that they have only today. And we definitely have tomorrow. And I thank everyone who ensures that with their courage and their effectiveness! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I urge you to do everything possible so that the OSCE becomes a co-creator of the victory over Russian terror - President during his speech at the OSCE PA</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-24</span></div>
  <p>Dear Madam President, Dear Speakers of the Sejm and Senate of Poland, Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the opportunity to address you. Today is exactly 9 months from the day when Russia started a criminal and unprovoked full-scale war against Ukraine. Our country is showing unprecedented bravery by destroying the army of the occupier, who was bragging that he was allegedly the second most powerful in the world. Most of the countries of the world are showing strong solidarity, helping us free our land from occupation and protecting our people from Russia&#x27;s genocidal policy. We see various international platforms finding the necessary solutions to help stop Russian terror, isolate the terrorist state as much as possible, and find a way out of the brutal global crises created by Russia. But why is there still no OSCE among these platforms? Why, in particular, is a terrorist state even after 9 months of its continuous crimes still a member of your Parliamentary Assembly? If it was not for the Polish decision regarding visas for the Russian delegation, for which I am grateful to Poland, grateful to the representatives of the Polish Sejm, the government, and also the President, so if it was not for this, the representatives of the terrorist state could be among you today. This fact is an open mockery of all the principles on the basis of which the OSCE was created. Russia uses massive missile strikes against peaceful cities. It is trying to leave millions of people without electricity, communication, heat and water. It is trying to turn millions of Ukrainians into refugees who would seek refuge in other countries - in your countries. Every day and every night for nine months, Russia has been shelling the cities it can reach with artillery and MLRS... And you all know very well that the current owners of Russia would like to do the same thing they are doing with Ukraine with other neighboring countries, too. They would love to if they could. If Ukraine had not stopped their aggressive ambitions. If the world had not shown solidarity. But the world was not looking for a meaningless compromise - all minus one - to fight Russian terror. So why should you be looking for that kind of compromise here? If obsolete regulations are designed to protect only false ideas about security and cooperation in Europe and do not really protect life and people, one cannot remain hostage to such procedures and regulations. Determination is required to change them. I urge you not to wait for winter, spring or summer to finally remove even the hypothetical possibility for supporters of terror to participate in any activity of your parliamentary assembly. I urge you to do everything you can to ensure that the OSCE is among those who are truly able to stop terror and help bring Russian murderers and torturers to justice. If you can act effectively at the level of your national parliaments, then the parliamentary assemblies must be able to act too - and not only at the level of verbal condemnations. Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine is a test for any international organization. Is it relevant or not? Is it capable of anything other than texts about what is happening, or not? Is it present among those who bring peace, or does it only care about how to preserve itself in its offices and halls? Russia does not read letters about peace and does not listen to statements about the Helsinki principles. Russia does not consider the presence of any Council in Europe as a value. Russia does not respect the Red Cross and will not obey just because some organization has been working for over a hundred years. You have to be where the greatest danger is, if your calling is to take care of safety. It is necessary to make effective decisions that have legal consequences for the enemies of a united Europe, if your task is to protect Europe. You have to fight for every person where a person is in the worst danger, you have to fight for access to such people, to really save them, if your task is to protect people. We see in Ukraine who really helps, and who perceives Russian terror as part of the television picture. We see who is trying for the sake of peace to break everything that stands in the way, and who is pretending that this is some kind of online genocide - watching and waiting for Russia to stop on its own at some point or for someone to somehow press the &quot;pause&quot; button. We see who shows humanity saving people, and who quietly thinks that Ukrainians can simply be sacrificed. We see it all. The world sees it. And there will definitely be conclusions. Conclusions about specific leaders who were afraid of true leadership. Conclusions regarding specific international organizations that opposed themselves to the movement of history. Conclusions about specific countries, which, unfortunately, were shackled by fear. Right now, and precisely on the basis of actions or lack of actions during the Russian terrorist war, the fate of many in the world is being determined. And I urge you to do everything possible so that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe becomes a co-creator of the victory over Russian terror, and therefore a co-creator of peace on our continent. I am grateful for the principled Presidency of the Assembly and for the conscientious work in the committees and at the level of national delegations - for all that serves to protect our values and helps isolate Russia for terror. And I urge to extend this principledness and conscientiousness to the procedural architecture of the Assembly and to the OSCE in general. The time has come for this reform! And, of course, in order to finally stop counting months of war and start counting the years of peace, it is necessary to use all national and international opportunities to put pressure on the terrorist state. Be leaders in this - and you will be leaders of the movement towards peace. Thank you for your attention! Thank you to everyone for supporting Ukraine! I believe that we will restore peace! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia has not found a way to break us and will not find it - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-24</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Restoration continues all day today - we are gradually restoring electricity, heat, water supply and communication. As of this evening, there are still problems with water in 15 regions. The most difficult situation is in the Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, Poltava and Kharkiv regions. But together with the supply of electricity to critical infrastructure, we also provide water and heat supply. The situation with electricity remains difficult in almost all regions. But still, we are moving away from the blackout little by little - every hour we restore power to new and new consumers. It is still the most difficult in the capital and 15 regions: Vinnytsia, Dnipropetrovsk, Zhytomyr, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi. There are also problems in other regions. Energy workers, utility workers, business - everyone is doing their part to give light again. This is truly a nationwide task - Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this. Thanks to the State Emergency Service and our entire system of regional administrations for the rapid deployment of the network of Points of Invincibility. In total, as of now, 4,362 points have been launched in most regions. And this is not yet the final figure - the network will grow according to how the points will be provided with generators and communication. Please, if your city has been without electricity or heat for more than 12 hours, use our Points of Invincibility. Assistance will also be provided at all police stations, at the facilities of the State Emergency Service. Please, if you know single or elderly people who need help, be sure to help them in these circumstances. A very important initiative was launched by our partners in the European Union. The European Parliament together with a network of European cities launched the &quot;Generators of Hope&quot; program. This will allow us to use the opportunities of horizontal cooperation in Europe - with cities, with businesses - and provide Ukraine with the energy equipment it needs now. I thank Mrs. Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, and all our friends in the European Union who have already joined and are still joining. I held another meeting of the Staff today. Energy and communication issues were analyzed in great detail: the protection of the energy system from new Russian strikes, restoration work and the supply of equipment and the involvement of specialists. Special attention is paid to the communication system. No matter what the terrorists are planning, we have to preserve communication. Russia wants Ukrainians to not just find themselves without light and heat... Terrorists want to isolate us from each other so that we do not feel each other. Therefore, this is a fundamental question. And there will be additional decisions regarding this issue. We are preparing them. Of course, the situation on the frontline was examined very carefully and in detail at the meeting of the Staff. No matter how difficult it may be, we are holding the key frontiers in all directions. Our guys defend bravely. And there are directions where we are preparing to advance. We observe how the occupiers are trying to redeploy additional forces. We do everything to &quot;subtract&quot; these forces of theirs. Almost every hour, I receive reports of strikes by the occupiers at Kherson and other communities of the region. Such terror began immediately after the Russian army was forced to flee from the Kherson region. This is the revenge of those who lost. They do not know how to fight. The only thing they can still do is terrorize. Either energy terror, or artillery terror, or missile terror - that&#x27;s all that Russia has degraded to under its current leaders. It is only the liberation of our land and reliable security guarantees for Ukraine that can protect our people from any Russian escalations. We work with partners every day for this. There will be important news soon. I addressed the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly today - the assembly is currently working in Poland. I called for the reform of this Organization so that it could finally help restore security in Europe. The principle of decision-making in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly is that it is necessary to agree on decisions for many months and to convince absolutely everyone, even to deprive the delegation of a terrorist state of its rights. It definitely shouldn&#x27;t be so. During such a war, during such terror, decisions against the guilty state must be made instantly. I hope that the OSCE members will listen to the Ukrainian appeal. I had a call with the President of Israel. I informed him about the consequences of the Russian energy terror, about the needs of our state in view of this. Ukrainian initiatives to overcome the food crisis created by Russia were also discussed. I invited Israel to join our “Grain from Ukraine” humanitarian project. And, by the way, we already have specific agreements with different countries, different leaders, how to make this initiative of ours to supply food to the poorest countries truly global. Soon we will present all the details. And one more thing. Today, another 50 Ukrainian warriors were freed from Russian captivity. Two officers, 48 privates and sergeants. 15 of them were captured in the Kyiv region, on the territory of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. Seven were captured on Zmiinyi Island. Finally they will all be home. I am grateful to Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Malyuk, Lubinets and everyone who helps. And we will do absolutely everything possible and impossible to return every Ukrainian man and woman who are still being held by the occupiers. I thank everyone who supports Ukraine in this extremely difficult time! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for our country! We endured nine months of the full-scale war and Russia hasn’t found a way to break us. And it will not find it. We must continue to hold on like this in the future! In unity and helping each other. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Europe&#x27;s dependence on Russian energy resources began to decrease, and should completely vanish - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the European Idea international symposium</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-25</span></div>
  <p>Dear friends! Dear colleagues! Dear Gitanas, thank you for the invitation to take part in this discussion in Kaunas. This year we all saw a very important thing. It&#x27;s like any athlete that can become champion only when participating in the competition. Like any judge that can convince everyone of his unbiased work and wisdom when the case hearing has started. Any teacher sees for himself what he is worth when students return to him years after and it is clearly seen in their eyes and life circumstances whether they have perceived what they have been taught. This year we saw Europe we&#x27;ve all been striving for. Europe we&#x27;ve been building for decades and dreaming of for much longer. We saw Europe in action. We saw Europe not only in its striving for justice, but also in the protection of justice. We saw Europe not only manifesting certain values, but also capable of winning on the basis of its values. We saw a united Europe not only as a goal or a set of agreements at the political level, but also as the results being achieved here and now. Europe has made conclusions from its historical mistakes made by previous generations. European nations no longer leave each other alone when tyranny starts an offensive. European leaders defend what unites all of us much more fiercely than what coincides with certain personal ideological views. European states achieve things that seemed fantasies ten years ago. This year the frontline in Ukraine has become the line of struggle of Europe for itself. 274 days have passed and it is obvious that the anti-European aggression of Russia will fail, and European freedom will be guaranteed. Russia still resorts to various forms of terror so far. Russia still has enough missiles and artillery to kill people everyday and provoke new difficulties for Ukraine and the whole of Europe. But what Russian imperialism has always bet on and what has ultimately caused Europe&#x27;s defeat isn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be the case. There is no split between Europeans. And maintaining such reality in Europe is our common task #1. This year Europe finally carries out energy disarmament of Russia. The continent&#x27;s dependence on Russian energy resources has started to reduce. And it must vanish completely. And one of the key instruments for that is to limit Russian profit from exports of its resources. The introduction of price caps, i.e. forcible price restriction for Russian oil, has already become the topic of discussion in Europe and the world. And there are allegedly discussions about the level of 60 or 70 U.S. dollars. No doubt, such words are just sandbagging. They&#x27;re rather an attempt to imitate something than to do something. And I am grateful to our Polish and Baltic colleagues for their quite relevant proposals. Limiting the price at the level of up to 30 U.S. dollars per barrel seems a more feasible proposal. And I am grateful that such a proposal has been put forward and is being advocated. Now is the time to ensure this achievement of Europe as well. And on the basis of this and other similar achievements, none of the potential enemies of Europe will ever be able to blackmail our continent with energy weapons. The energy security of Europe, and therefore the price security, will now be based first of all on cooperation and solidarity between Europeans, and on European energy rules. We also have one more result, which is definitely important. Dear friends! This year we have eliminated the gray zone on the EU borders, which Ukraine has been staying in for decades. Our state has become a candidate for EU membership and implements this perspective. Hence, we are finally eliminating the strategic uncertainty, which has been the source of instability for the whole continent and instigated Russia&#x27;s revanchism. And we must begin our accession negotiations just as quickly as we&#x27;ve gained the candidate status. When Ukraine&#x27;s fate is determined, the fate of the whole center and east of Europe is determined. Ukraine is and will be free, Ukraine is and will be democratic, Ukraine is and will be strong. Ukraine exists and will exist. Hence, Europe exists and will exist. So when we guarantee a long-standing security for Ukraine, we guarantee the same security for the whole continent. That is why, on the basis of what we have already managed to achieve, we must do one more thing. A very practical one. I have no doubt that eventually we will implement the Ukraine Peace Formula, stop the Russian aggression, and dismantle the threats it has brought to Ukraine, Europe and the world. But we must already show our vitality, the energetic nature of Europe. Just as the front line in Ukraine became the line of Europe&#x27;s struggle for itself, the reconstruction of Ukraine must become for Europe a reconstruction of itself. This is the largest economic and humanitarian project of our generations. The greatest opportunities for the economic development of European countries. The biggest opportunities for European companies and the biggest boost for European production. Hence, this is the biggest potential for our social development. The implementation of this project has already begun. When we rebuild energy sphere to withstand Russian terror, it is rebuilding Europe. When we rebuild our infrastructure, social facilities, and housing to provide for Ukrainians, we give the whole of Europe an incentive to work for itself together with us. When we look for and find new logistics, production and trade opportunities for Ukraine, we look for and find them for everyone who cooperates with us. We do it as equals. We do this for our common interests. And that&#x27;s how we must overcome the key challenge facing us now in order to strengthen us all. We must endure this winter - winter everyone will remember. We must do everything to remember not what it has threatened us with, but what we&#x27;ve managed to do to protect ourselves from this threat. And that is why we need to clearly understand the idea of Europe. A united Europe - it is very important. I often hear the same question - how Europe can help Ukraine . Of course, we are grateful for that, but is the question formed correctly? Europe can help itself. It&#x27;s not about helping Ukraine stand up to Russia, it&#x27;s about Europe being able to help itself stand up to Russia. It is not only in Ukraine that millions of people are without light and heat because of Russian terror. It is on the eastern flank of Europe that millions of Europeans are without light and heat due to Russian terror. It is not only Ukraine that Russia wants to break, it is Europe that Russia wants to break. We are all parts of one whole. What was a dream. What started with politics. What has become our life - a united Europe. This is the key idea. There is no Ukraine separate from Europe, just as there is no Poland or Lithuania or Romania or Latvia or Germany or France separate from Europe. This is our continent. This is our life. And this is our path that we can endure. Just as this winter and this war. All Europeans together. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your continued support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The key task this week is energy – address of President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-25</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! The key task of today, as well as of other days this week, is energy. From Wednesday to today, it was possible to halve the number of people for whom electricity is cut off to stabilize the system. As of this evening, blackouts continue in most regions and in Kyiv. In total, more than six million subscribers. Almost 12 million subscribers were disconnected from the grid on Wednesday evening. Most of the problems are currently in the capital of Ukraine, as well as in Kyiv region, Odesa region, Lviv region, Vinnytsia region and Dnipropetrovsk region. Please, it is necessary to consume electricity sparingly in all regions, as before. If you don&#x27;t have a power outage, it doesn&#x27;t mean the problem is over. Please, if you have electricity, this does not mean that you can turn on several powerful electrical appliances at once. Spiked power draws are recorded every evening, which cause an increase in emergency blackouts. Now, as before, it is necessary to save energy. Points of Invincibility are deployed throughout the country. But I know that, unfortunately, not in all cities the local government has done a good job. In particular, there are many complaints in Kyiv. In fact, only the Points that are deployed at the base of the State Emergency Service and at the railway station of the capital are normally provided, and other Points still need to be improved, to put it mildly. Please pay attention. Kyiv residents need more protection. As of this evening, 600,000 subscribers have been disconnected from the grid in the city. Many Kyiv residents were without electricity for more than 20 or even 30 hours. I expect quality work from the mayor&#x27;s office. No one will forgive anyone for desecrating the Kyiv Points of Invincibility. Please be more serious. As well as lies in reports of various levels. I was in Vyshgorod, Kyiv region today, where a Russian missile destroyed an apartment building and damaged the houses of an entire residential neighborhood. Six people have been killed then, dozens have been injured. My condolences to the families of the victims. We do everything to help and we help. I visited two Points of Invincibility in Vyshgorod: at the base of the State Emergency Service and at a local school. They are arranged exactly as it should be. In total, there are now more than 4,000 Points in the country, and it is the responsibility of each local leader to ensure that everything that should be there for people really works. I spoke today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. I thanked her for the decision to provide a EUR 2.5 billion macro-financial assistance. They approved another EUR 0.5 billion by the end of the year and discussed the preparation of the support package for the next year. They also agreed on new steps in energy support for Ukraine. Today, I took part in the international symposium &quot;The idea of Europe&quot; in Lithuania. I called on the partners to take new steps for the sake of our joint victory and thanked Poland and the Baltic States for their principled stance to cap the price of exported Russian energy. I believe that the partners&#x27; proposals to introduce a more significant price restriction for Russian oil than was sounded this week are quite valid. In the evening, I signed another decree awarding our soldiers. Some 216 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards. I would especially like to mention the fighters of the 71st separate hunting brigade and the 24th Aidar assault battalion for their bravery and effectiveness in destroying the enemy and conducting counter-offensive actions. As well as the border guards of the Lviv and Mohyliv-Podilsky detachments, who are ferocious in defense of the Bakhmut and Avdiyivka directions. Thank you, warriors! Thank you to everyone who fights for our country! Who is doing everything to suppress the occupiers that are shelling, unfortunately, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and our other cities. Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine and Ukrainians! To everyone who brings heat, water, electricity and communication back to people. Glory to our indestructible people! Glory to all of you – well done! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Opening address of President of Ukraine at the inaugural International Summit оn Food Security under Grain from Ukraine humanitarian program</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-26</span></div>
  <p>Dear attendees! It is a great honor to have you here with us today Ladies and Gentlemen! I welcome you to our capital, the city of Kyiv, to this special event for us, which is dedicated to a special initiative and takes place on such a special day for our state, for Ukraine. Every year, on the last Saturday in November, we honor the memory of millions of people. Millions of tortured and murdered Ukrainians. Women, men, elderly people. Millions of children. Millions of victims of famine. In 1921, 1922, 1923, 1946, 1947, and the darkest years – 1932-1933. Today is the 90th anniversary of the genocide committed against us by the totalitarian Stalinist regime. Different historians call different numbers of victims, but either way, all of them are shocking. From four to eight million perished Ukrainians. We remember how it is when they want to destroy your people. Almost every family has been affected in one way or another. Almost everyone among us has someone in the National Memory Book of victims. We remember the stories of those who managed to survive these horrors, truly vivid memories. How they take away everything. How you can be shot for a hidden bowl of grain or flour. How a large family shares a loaf of bread for a week. How it is a soup from two rotten potatoes to eat the whole day. How in the morning there is no strength to even live and open your eyes. How it is hard to fall asleep at night because you just want to eat. How exhausted people fall dead on the road. And others are too exhausted to take and bury their bodies. How whole families die, how streets wound up dead, how villages perish. How in already independent Ukraine, even in the new millennium, our grandparents, who survived the Holodomor, treated food with respect. How carefully they gathered the crumbs that remained on the table after dinner into a handful. How they said: there were times in childhood when we dreamed of a piece of bread or a plate of borscht. Such terrible memories. We know about it. We remember that. We have to! And we see what is happening today in the world, what is happening in Ukraine. They want to destroy us again with bombs, bullets, cold, and again with hunger. On February 24, Russia started a full-scale war against our society, the people of Ukraine, against our state. The occupation and the blockade left thousands of people without food and water from the very beginning. We will not allow millions of people in the world to be left without food and water. We remember how it used to be. Unfortunately, we know how it happens today. We won&#x27;t make it happen tomorrow. Neither here, nor in any country of the world on the entire planet. Our flag is a blue sky and a golden wheat field. Our land has always given generous fruits. Our country has always shared these fruits with the whole world. Ukraine is traditionally one of the largest exporters of food to different countries of the world on different continents. Our wheat was highly valued in Africa and the Middle East. Dairy products, vegetables, fruits, corn – in Europe. Sunflower oil was on shelves all over the world. This year, unfortunately, is different. Russian troops surrounded Ukrainian ports. They blocked the export of our food. They put the world on the brink of starvation. They provoked a food crisis. The rapid increase in the price of products undermines the economic security of ordinary people, the well-being of millions of families, domestic stability and regional security. Mass protests due to rising food, fertilizer, and fuel prices threaten many countries and societies. We must prevent the further spread of this crisis and this global challenge. Ukraine, as one of the guarantors of global food security, will continue making its key contribution. Despite the war. Despite any challenges. Despite the obstacles. Despite the attempt to destroy us. Ukraine will fulfill its export obligations regarding the supply of grain and other foodstuffs to the global market. Ukraine is a fighter for life, its own and that of other peoples. Life without slavery and hunger. The first practical proof of this was the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The export of Ukrainian food was unblocked. To date, almost 500 vessels have left our ports. This is 12 million tonnes of foodstuffs for 40 countries of the world. And for all societies, because when we talk about continents and states, first of all, we are talking about people. In particular, those suffering from the food crisis, who found themselves on the brink of this challenge – on the brink of starvation. However, the Grain Initiative, unfortunately, still operates not at its full capacity. Russia is trying to delay the movement of vessels. There are more than 80 ships in line in the Bosphorus. We advocate an increase in the number of ports and the indefinite continuation of this important initiative. So that Russia does not block it again. Again and again. At the same time, it is obvious that today even the full functioning of the grain corridor is insufficient to meet food needs. Especially of those countries that are in acute danger of hunger. To overcome this and food threats in general, Ukraine has organized this event. This is the first such event – the International Summit on Food Security. Here I want to announce and tell you about our new international initiative, supported by you, colleagues, and we are very grateful to you – Grain from Ukraine. Within its framework, Ukrainian food will be sent to countries in Africa and Asia. Our goal is ambitious and specific – to save at least 5 million people from hunger. On this path, Ukraine has already taken the first steps – sent the first ships. In the middle of November – 27,000 tonnes of wheat for Ethiopia. Another vessel is being loaded today. And this is another 30,000 tonnes of wheat for people in Ethiopia. Three more vessels are currently going to the ports of Ukraine for loading. They will deliver more than 80,000 tonnes of food wheat to the countries that need it the most. In general, under the Grain From Ukraine program, by the end of next spring, we plan to send at least 60 vessels from our ports – at least ten per month – to countries at risk of famine and drought. This is Ethiopia, these are Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Congo, Kenya, Nigeria. All of them are in dire need of help. Imagine – just one ship with grain provides food for 90,000 people. Sixty such ships will be able to prevent the starvation of at least 5 million inhabitants of the world. We invite other states and socially responsible businesses to this humanitarian initiative, humanitarian program. And I am happy to announce today that on the day of its launch, 20 countries joined Grain From Ukraine and there will be more. And I am glad that today we all gathered together in Kyiv. Some are offline, some are online. But in this format, today the participants of the International Summit on Food Security are President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, President of France Emmanuel Macron, and Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. Prime Ministers of Poland, Lithuania, Romania, and Belgium: Mateusz Morawiecki, Ingrida Šimonytė, Nicolae Ciucă, Alexander De Croo. President of Hungary Katalin Novák. UN Secretary General Mr. Guterres. Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. Prime Minister of Sweden Ulf Kristersson and Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenković. Presidents of Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Slovenia, Bulgaria. Secretary General of NATO. High-ranking officials of the UK, the Czech Republic, Italy, Austria, Spain, Qatar, and Canada. The United States Agency for International Development, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the World Food Programme in Ukraine, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. I believe that the mix is strong enough for the first such initiative. I want to thank you all. Based on the results of the summit, we will issue a Joint Statement. It will remain open for accession by interested parties. However, we welcome not only joining it but also any other format of participation in this program. Because its goal is our common goal – to prevent hunger in the world. The future of humanity depends on the readiness to respond effectively to the challenges of today. And one of the most important tasks is to have effective mechanisms – and this is one such mechanism, which is effective and functional – to guarantee food security. Today, I want to suggest that a new international institution has been created as a continuation of this initiative. An institution that will be a new, efficient and effective tool to prevent global threats and rapidly respond to them. All threats: food, humanitarian, security. With headquarters in Kyiv or Odesa, from where a ship will soon depart within the Grain From Ukraine program. Ladies and Gentlemen! Amid ongoing Russian aggression, it is no less important to recognize the Holodomor of 1932–1933 as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. This has already been done by the United States, Canada, Australia, Poland – in total, by our friends from 17 countries. In 2022 it was Brazil and the Czech Republic. The day before, I called on the states and international organizations that have not yet done so to do this. On November 23, Romania approved the relevant decision. We are grateful. On November 24 it was Ireland. On November 25 – Moldova. I invite others to join this important historical truth. This will be a strong manifestation of solidarity with Ukraine in these extremely difficult times for us. In addition, there is something that can be done today. All of Ukraine will hold a national minute of silence today. We will light a memorial candle in our windows. We invite all other countries and nations to join us. At 16:00 Kyiv time. At 15:00 CET. When it will be 2:00 p.m. in London, it will be 9:00 a.m. in New York and Toronto, 7:30 p.m. in New Delhi, 10:00 p.m. in Beijing, 11:00 p.m. in Tokyo and Seoul, and 1:00 a.m. in Sydney. As proof that we all do not forget, we all remember the past and are ready to build a different, just future together. The human future, at any time of the day or night. Finally, I invite everyone to Ukraine in a year – for our next second summit – the International Summit on Food Security and our Grain From Ukraine initiative. To evaluate joint efforts. To outline further plans. I am sure, we will be able to achieve results and overcome all threats only united, only together. We can win only together. Ukraine and the civilized world without war, without terrorism, without hunger. Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Never again should hunger be used as a weapon – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-26</span></div>
  <p>Indestructible people of the indestructible country! Today, we held the first International Summit on Food Security. We held it in Kyiv – together with our partners. And precisely these days were chosen deliberately, when we commemorate the victims of the Holodomor of 1932-1933. Ukrainians went through genocide. And today we are doing everything possible and impossible to stop Russia&#x27;s new genocidal policy. A new one – but similar to the one that killed millions of people in the 20th century. And we don&#x27;t just fight off aggression. Step by step, we are creating a system that will stop aggression, dismantle its consequences, and guarantee long-term security – the security of Ukraine, all of Europe, and the world. Food security is one of the key elements of global stability. This is where Ukraine&#x27;s leading role is most evident. Thanks to our export grain initiative from three Black Sea ports, we sent about 12 million tonnes of food to the world market. 40 countries of the world. Of this amount, more than two and a half million tonnes are for countries that are not just short of food, but in a severe crisis. As part of the UN Food Programme, we have helped countries where people are literally starving or on the verge of starvation. These include Ethiopia and Yemen. We also helped Somalia and Afghanistan. And this is just the beginning. Today, we officially announced the launch of our new humanitarian initiative. Grain From Ukraine. And we already have agreements with many partners on joint work within Grain from Ukraine. The European Union, the United States, France, the UK, Germany, Japan, Qatar, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Italy, Austria, Spain, Sweden, Slovenia, Switzerland and others. More than 20 countries supported our food security summit. The total amount that we have accumulated for Grain From Ukraine is already about $150 million. Work continues. We are preparing up to 60 ships. All of us together do not just send Ukrainian foodstuffs to those countries that suffer the most from the food crisis. We affirm that never again should hunger be used as a weapon. If it weren&#x27;t for Ukrainian food, if it weren&#x27;t for our joint leadership with our partners, social stability in such regions as North Africa or the Middle East would not have been maintained. This is exactly what Russia wanted. We must – and we can! – not allow this. Today, I met with the Prime Minister of Belgium. We discussed our joint actions – and not only for the sake of food security. We signed a declaration on Belgium&#x27;s support for Ukraine&#x27;s full membership in both the European Union and NATO – this is an important signal. We discussed further political and defense cooperation, sanctions against Russia, the possibility of Belgium helping us through this winter. Today, a meeting of the Lublin Triangle took place in Kyiv – at the level of prime ministers – Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. They signed a joint statement on further support for Ukraine and the international legal order. So, today is a very busy diplomatic day. A day that strengthened both Ukraine and our partners. Today, our power engineers continued restoring the system – and we now have more opportunities to generate and supply electricity. But, unfortunately, not enough to make the supply completely stable. As of this morning, half as many subscribers have been disconnected from the grid than last night. However, in 14 regions and in Kyiv, there are still restrictions for more than a hundred thousand subscribers in each of the regions. If consumption increases in the evening, the number of outages may increase. This once again shows how important it is now to save power and consume it rationally. This afternoon, the enemy launched a missile attack on Dnipropetrovsk region – on private houses, on ordinary houses. There are wounded. They shelled Donetsk region, the south, and other regions. Russia is turning this day – the day of remembrance – into a day of terror. The occupiers will definitely be responsible for all this. And we will drive them out of our land. And one more. Today, we managed to release 12 more Ukrainians from Russian captivity. Of them, three are civilians, two are officers, and seven are privates and sergeants. This week alone, we returned 98 of our people from captivity to Ukraine. We will return all the others. Thanks to everyone who helps us! Thank you to every leader who works with us for the sake of European and global security! Glory to our soldiers and our indestructible people! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine. And please, today honor the memory of Ukrainian men and women, children and adults, whose lives were taken by the Holodomor-genocide.</p>

  <h2>Helping one another, we will get through this winter and Russia&#x27;s attempt to use the cold against people - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-27</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Another week of full-scale war is coming to an end - a week in which we accomplished a lot. All together. Thanks to our unity. After the massive terrorist attack last Wednesday, we have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day. As of today, in most regions of the country, only stabilization schedules of shutdowns are in effect. The situation is under control by the energy workers. And for that, I am thankful to the thousands of people who worked round the clock all over our state to restore light, water, heat and communication. I thank all the employees of energy companies, utility services, repair crews, regional authorities and leaders of local communities who helped. I would also like to thank the businesses that participated. Ukrainian unity again and again demonstrates its strength, demonstrates our effectiveness. I thank all Ukrainian entrepreneurs who are now making their offices, branches, cafes and other facilities new Points of Invincibility. Who do everything to help people. We understand that terrorists are preparing new strikes. We know that for sure. And as long as they have missiles, they won’t stop, unfortunately. But our ability to help each other and take care of the most vulnerable - the elderly, families with children, those who lost homes and relatives in the war - our mutual assistance is one of the elements of protection against terror and our strength. The upcoming week can be as hard as the one that passes. Our Defense Forces are preparing. The whole state is preparing. We work out all scenarios, including with our partners. And our unity must be ready. So please do not leave without help those whom you can help. And please pay attention to the air alerts during the week. Together and helping each other we will pass this challenge of war as well: this winter, this Russia&#x27;s attempt to use the cold against people. The situation at the front remains very difficult. And most of all - in the Donetsk region, as in previous weeks. I want to thank all our warriors, all our heroes for their resilience today! To endure now and defend ourselves now is to endure and defend ourselves for generations to come for all Ukrainians throughout our beautiful land. We are doing and will do everything possible to strengthen our defense. We are doing and will do everything to hold Russia accountable for this war, for this terror. And in order to achieve these results, there will be new important steps in the upcoming week. I thank all our partners who help us! I am grateful to every leader who perceives the defense of Ukraine as the defense of freedom and security for his country as well! Together we will endure everything. I&#x27;m sure of that! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine will never be a place of devastation - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-28</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on today. The morning began with the Staff meeting. Frontline. Provision of the army. Energy sector. Communication. Points of Invincibility. Strengthening our air defense. Working with partners. The situation in the frontline areas and suppression of Russian firing positions. We keep all key issues in the focus of the Staff’s attention. That day, as every other day, the occupiers again shelled Kherson and the communities of the region. In just one week, the enemy fired 258 times on 30 settlements of our Kherson region. The Russian army also damaged the pumping station that supplied water to Mykolaiv. Well, what can be said about them? This is the real essence of those random &quot;comrades&quot; who took over Russia. After 20 years of rule, a large part of their own state is in such devastation, as if a war had taken place there. And this is not a war - it’s just because they have come. They are capable of nothing but devastation. This is all they leave behind. And what they are doing now against Ukraine is their attempt to take revenge. To take revenge for the fact that Ukrainians have repeatedly defended themselves from them. Ukraine will never be a place for devastation. Ukraine will never accept orders from these &quot;comrades&quot; from Moscow. We will do everything to restore every object, every house, every enterprise destroyed by the occupiers. Today I spoke about Ukraine&#x27;s needs for protection and reconstruction with the foreign ministers of seven Northern European countries. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Iceland. I thanked them for this joint visit to Ukraine - a gesture of support and solidarity that is very important right now. We have agreements on further cooperation in the defense and energy spheres, in the reconstruction projects of our state and in the sanctions sphere. The Ukrainian Peace Formula was discussed with each of the delegations, in great detail - the possible participation of each state in the implementation of the points of the Formula. We are actively working to create a Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. We are working at different levels. In particular, I discussed this today with the foreign ministers of the partner countries. Head of the Office Andriy Yermak took part in the conference held in France. Members of the working group on the issue of creating a Tribunal work there. Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin and the First Lady of Ukraine represented our country in Britain today - a conference on combating sexual violence in wartime was held there. Mr. Kostin is preparing to meet with the G7 ministers of justice in Berlin tomorrow. The main topic of all these events is Russia&#x27;s responsibility for war and terror. There will be more news tomorrow. I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. By the way, the Netherlands provides substantial assistance to Ukraine in the preparation of the Tribunal for aggression and in establishing the truth about all Russian murderers and torturers. Ukraine is grateful for this. I heard a very important signal from Mr. Prime Minister Rutte - a signal about next year. Support for our state will only increase. I met with the ambassadors of our United24 fundraising platform. Andriy Shevchenko, Oleksandr Usyk, Scott Kelly - they were in Kyiv, and Elina Svitolina, Liev Schreiber and Timothy Snyder joined the meeting via video call. The main issue is getting through this winter, helping Ukraine with generators and other energy equipment. Detailed news will be tomorrow, but I will note: we will do everything so that Ukraine receives the maximum possible help from the world. And one more thing. The volume of accumulated funds for our Grain from Ukraine initiative is growing and already exceeds 180 million U.S. dollars. This is already one of the historically largest Ukrainian humanitarian initiatives. And it will be even bigger. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Greece, Estonia, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Canada, Qatar, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, USA, Türkiye, Hungary, Finland, France, Croatia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, European Union have already announced their financial, technical or logistical contribution to the Grain From Ukraine initiative - this is a significant participation. Plus the Republic of Korea. Japan - from the first days. And also NATO and, of course, the UN. I am thankful to everyone who participates! Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine implement our Peace Formula! I am sure that it can be fully implemented - all points just as the point on food security. Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to all who work for the victory of our state! And please pay attention to the air sirens, don&#x27;t forget that. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine will become a role model of reconstruction - President addressed the General Assembly of the International Bureau of Expositions regarding the holding of Expo 2030 in Odesa</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-29</span></div>
  <p>Mr. President! Mr. Secretary General! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am honoured to present Ukraine’s candidate for hosting World’s Fair 2030. To present Odesa – and the entire Black Sea region. Why Odesa? Why Ukraine? Why the Black Sea? This year, Ukraine has become the world’s role model of bravery. Billions of people from every continent could see what Ukrainian invincibility means, why Russian terror will not achieve its goal. And they will see how Ukraine becomes a role model of reconstruction. Neither winter cold, nor darkness nor other manifestations of terror will help Russia conquer Ukrainians. The time of Ukrainian victory shall come. And then… The reconstruction of our country will become the most momentous economic, technological, and humanitarian project of our time. Even now, we engage dozens of our partner countries to rebuild Ukraine. The total volume of work amounts to over a trillion dollars. Even now, we create a special patronage system. The system will enable leading countries and companies to take patronage over the reconstruction of Ukrainian regions, cities, industries, and enterprises. Not just to recover them but to show that a free world and conscious countries are always more powerful than any tyranny and aggression. We can already see the interest in patronage from France and Great Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, Denmark and Finland, Italy and Türkiye, Poland and Portugal, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, Latvia and Estonia, Switzerland and Slovakia, Austria and Greece, Canada and the United States of America, Japan and Australia. And this is not a full list of the countries. In 2030, Ukrainian reconstruction will have already shown a significant part of the projected results, and Ukraine will be the country to demonstrate what humanity is capable of when all peoples cooperate for peace and security, for development, and a more comfortable future for all. And this is, by the way, a fundamental meaning behind the World’s Fairs. So, the reality of our country and the spirit of the World’s Fairs will ally. Specifically in Ukraine, specifically in 2030. Even now, we have already proved that the Black Sea region is one of the key guarantors of the world’s stability. Our Odesa is that big port that ensures the social well-being of dozens of countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe. This year, we have proved it with our Grain Export Initiative. We will solidify it with another international humanitarian project “Grain From Ukraine”. It will help recover food security in the poorest countries that are balancing at the edge of famine and destabilization – Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen, and others. These and many other countries will be widely aware of why Odesa and the Black Sea are so significant. We will save millions of people – Odesa will save millions of people thanks to the work of its ports. We are already integrating Ukraine into the European Union. We have already become a part of the EU Single Market. We will become a part of the EU institutions. We have already joined the EU Single Energy System. We will become those whose potential in “green” energy will replace dirty Russian fossil fuel for Europe. We have already helped Europe to overcome many internal controversies and actually unite – unite in its actions. Enhanced by Ukraine, Europe will become a truly independent and really solid global player. 2030 is the time when we will be able to celebrate it. To celebrate it together with all Europeans. Is it fair that the World’s Fairs have never been hosted in this part of Europe? Many world regions have already been represented. Europe had the honour to host the World’s Fairs in different years. But not the East of Europe. We should change it. And Odesa will be a perfect place to do it. The city that through the centuries has been tied economically and culturally with Türkiye and Romania, Georgia and Bulgaria, Moldova and other countries of our region as well as many world’s regions. The city that has always been multinational and multicultural – the city of diversity. The city that may host the World’s Fair for the first time but has been connected with the world for centuries. Ladies and Gentlemen! When you visit Ukraine and our Odesa in 2030, you will sense the power, freedom, and culture of not just one country and one city. You will experience the potential of the entire humanity. That is why it is 2030. That is why it is Odesa, Ukraine, and the Black Sea. That is why it is the World’s Fair. May the victory of freedom and our striving for peace become widely seen! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>For Russia to be held to account for aggression, a Special Tribunal is needed, and we are doing everything to create it - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-29</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, we took several new steps to restore justice to Ukraine, to bring to justice all those responsible for this criminal war. We are already cooperating with many countries and international organizations so that every Russian murderer receives the deserved punishment. We have already established cooperation with the International Criminal Court and will increase it. But, unfortunately, the available international legal instruments are not enough for justice. Even in the International Criminal Court, it is still impossible to bring the highest political and military leadership of Russia to justice for the crime of aggression against our state - for the primary crime. The crime that gave birth to all other crimes of this war - and not only after February 24, but also from 2014. That&#x27;s when it all started. For there to be responsibility for aggression, a Special Tribunal is needed - in addition to the International Criminal Court. And we are doing everything to create such a tribunal. Today, the address of the First Lady of Ukraine to the Parliament and the people of Great Britain was dedicated to this task exactly. Olena&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom is currently underway. And on behalf of all Ukrainian men and women who suffered from Russian aggression, she called on Great Britain to become a leader in global efforts to establish a Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and to restore justice. The British have this experience, it is part of our shared historical memory. In the winter of 1942, when no one could predict when World War II would end, it was in London that representatives of the Allies signed the Declaration of St. James&#x27;s Palace. The document that started the path to the Nuremberg trials, that is, to justice after that war. Now we already have strong cooperation with the Netherlands, which is helping with the creation of a prosecutor&#x27;s office to collect evidence of war crimes. We are working with France, which helps us in field work to document Russian evil. And we must unite the world majority in support of the draft resolution of the UN General Assembly regarding the Special Tribunal. We must develop the necessary legal architecture to make the tribunal work. We must fully implement this clause of our Peace Formula and really ensure justice after this war, just as after the Second World War. I believe that Great Britain will show its leadership precisely in this struggle for justice. Today, the Russian War Crimes exhibition was opened in London - this is a project that demonstrates to the world what Russia has brought to Ukrainian soil. This exhibition worked in Davos, during the World Economic Forum, also in New York - during the UN General Assembly, in Brussels, at the headquarters of NATO. Now the British will see it. All leading countries will know and see what evil Russism is responsible for. A meeting of justice ministers of the G7 countries was held in Berlin - an extremely useful one. Ukraine was represented there by the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice of our country. This meeting was devoted precisely to bringing the occupiers and the aggressor state to justice for everything they have done. Following the meeting, we can see an obvious willingness to work together to eventually restore the force of international law, restore the full effect of the UN Charter and bring Russia to a fair liability. I spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz today - it is Germany that chairs the G7 this year. We discussed our cooperation both at the bilateral level and in international institutions. The priorities are clear - protection against missile terror, energy restoration, food security. I thanked the Chancellor for his support. The situation at the front is difficult. Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south. But we are holding out and - most importantly - do not allow the enemy to fulfill their intentions. They said they would capture the Donetsk region in spring, summer, autumn... Winter begins this week already. They wasted their regular army there, they lose hundreds of mobilized and mercenaries there every day, they use barrier troops there… This year, Russia will lose a hundred thousand of its soldiers killed and only God knows how many mercenaries. And Ukraine will stand. And the world will do everything to ensure that everyone guilty of this criminal war is brought to justice. And I also want to thank the Netherlands for today&#x27;s decision - the House of Representatives of the States General recognized Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Step by step, the world will put everything in its place. Glory to all who fight for freedom! Glory to all who work for our victory! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are analyzing the intentions of the occupiers and preparing a countermeasure - even more powerful than now - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-11-30</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held another meeting of the Staff today. The main issues are the Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Kharkiv region, Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Crimea, frontline territories and our state border. We are analyzing the intentions of the occupiers and are preparing a countermeasure - an even more powerful countermeasure than now. We considered the issue of providing for the military and supplying new equipment and ammunition. I separately held a meeting on energy and communication issues. We record the results of what has already been done to protect our systems. We are preparing new solutions. We are also preparing new solutions to prevent any opportunity for Russia to manipulate the internal life of Ukraine. We will provide details in due time. As of this evening, about 6 million subscribers in most regions of our country and in Kyiv are disconnected from electricity. The situation remains very difficult in the capital, as well as in the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Lviv, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy regions. Energy workers and utility workers, all our services are doing everything to stabilize the system and give people more energy for longer. And I want to emphasize once again: it is very important that people understand when and for what period of time they will be left without electricity. This is the responsibility of both the energy companies themselves and local authorities. People have a right to know. And to the extent that it is possible now, the predictability of life should be ensured. People see that in neighboring houses or on nearby streets, for some reason, the rules regarding light are different. And there should be justice and clarity. Today we have two very important pieces of international news. Canada has successfully completed the issuance of special bonds - bonds of sovereign support of Ukraine. The volume is 500 million Canadian dollars. In fact, Canada assumes this debt to help our nation. The funds will go to the state budget of Ukraine. I am grateful to our Canadian friends and personally to Mr. Justin Trudeau and Mrs. Chrystia Freeland for this manifestation of Canadian leadership. Leadership that demonstrates to other partners what can be effective right now to support Ukraine. And news from Germany. The Bundestag voted for a resolution recognizing the Holodomor as genocide of the Ukrainian people. This is a decision for justice, for truth. And this is a very important signal to many other countries of the world that Russian revanchism will not succeed in rewriting history. We would praise one more decision of Germany, which will certainly become historic, - to transfer the Patriot system to Ukraine. All generations of Ukrainians will thank Chancellor Scholz, as well as the entire generation of modern German politicians. Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Gratitude to everyone who helps our state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will guarantee spiritual independence to Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-01</span></div>
  <p>Free people of the indomitable country! Every year on December 1, we recall an event that defined history. An event that said a lot about all of us, about Ukrainians. About who we are. And about who we will never become. On December 1, 31 years ago, a referendum was held that united the entire territory of our state. None of our people remained outside the All-Ukrainian decision. Kyiv and Sevastopol, Odesa and Crimea, Lviv and Cherkasy, Chernihiv and Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk, Khmelnytskyi and Kirovohrad regions, Volyn and Dnipropetrovsk regions, Sumy and Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil, Zhytomyr region and Chernivtsi, Vinnytsia, Kyiv region, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Rivne... Everyone expressed their support. People confirmed the Act of Proclamation of Independence of Ukraine - freely and legally. It was a real referendum, not some kind of imitation. It was an honest referendum, and that is why it was recognized by the world. And it was important that not just politicians, but people in particular put an end to the history of the empire, which was built on denying the will of the people. Which killed, trying to perpetuate the denial of the will of the people, but which was overthrown by people anyway. And precisely by their own will. Since that day in 1991, Ukrainians have experienced many attempts to turn a dot into three dots or a semicolon. We saw many figures who could not put up with the fact that the empire had been overthrown. We are still defending Ukraine against such &quot;comrades&quot; who wanted to celebrate the centenary of the empire this year instead of another anniversary of freedom. They wanted... But Ukrainian rules will prevail. Our desire to live freely expressed on August 24 and confirmed on December 1 will not be broken. Ukrainians will never again be gears of some empires. We have already gained it and we will ensure the full independence of our state. We will ensure, in particular, spiritual independence. We will never allow anyone to build an empire inside the Ukrainian soul. A meeting of the National Security and Defense Council was held today. The meeting at which we considered numerous facts of connections of certain religious circles in Ukraine with the aggressor state. Unfortunately, even Russian terror and full-scale war did not convince some figures that it is worth overcoming the temptation of evil. Well, we have to create conditions where no actors dependent on the aggressor state will have an opportunity to manipulate Ukrainians and weaken Ukraine from within. So, first. The National Security and Defense Council instructed the Government to submit to the Verkhovna Rada a draft law on making it impossible for religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation to operate in Ukraine. Second. The State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience was commissioned to ensure the religious examination of the Management Statute of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for the presence of a church-canonical connection with the Moscow Patriarchate and, if necessary, to take measures provided for by law. Third. Ensure the verification of the presence of legal grounds and compliance with the conditions of use by religious organizations of the property located on the territory of the National Kyiv-Pechersk Historical and Cultural Reserve. Fourth. All bodies responsible for ensuring national security must intensify measures to identify and counter the subversive activities of Russian special services in the religious environment of Ukraine. And apply personal sanctions - the surnames will be made public soon. And fifth. We need to raise the status and strengthen the capabilities of the State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience. This structure will be reformed, which will enable it to really protect the rights and legitimate interests of the Ukrainians and the state. With these and other decisions, we guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s spiritual independence. I would like to emphasize: in 1991, our state embarked on the legal and democratic path. We will continue this path. Only legal steps. Balanced decisions. And national interests. Today, we continued to work on the implementation of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which I presented at the G19 summit, in particular its clause on food security. To this end, I spoke with the President of Senegal and the Chairperson of the African Union. About our Grain From Ukraine initiative. This is an initiative that really brings stability and predictability back to the world. And also about the way we can involve African countries in restoring the strength of international law and guaranteeing the completeness of global security. And one more thing. Today, another 50 Ukrainians were brought home from Russian captivity. Four officers, 46 sergeants and privates. Army, territorial defense, national guards, Navy and border guards. I thank our entire team, which works for the liberation of Ukrainians. Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Malyuk, Lubinets. Well done. I am grateful to everyone who helps! In total, since February 24, more than 1,300 Ukrainians have already been returned from Russian captivity. We will bring back all the rest! All of Ukraine will be free. All Ukrainians will be at home. Glory to all who fight for our country! Glory to all who work to protect Ukraine! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Thank you to everyone who, despite constant Russian shelling, is doing everything so that Ukrainians can live normally – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-02</span></div>
  <p>Good night, dear Ukrainians! It was a special day of a special week. The nicest, the most symbolic thing is that today I had a privilege to honor with awards our heroes released from Russian captivity and members of our team – those who are working for the return of Ukrainians home. Now I want to thank once again everyone who is doing this task. A total of 1,331 – so many have been already released during the full-scale war. And we will not leave a single Ukrainian in Russian prisons, camps and &quot;isolation.&quot; We remember everyone. The day will come – we will welcome them again free. All this week, we worked at various levels in European capitals in order to gain a critical mass of support for the launch of a special tribunal – a tribunal on Russian aggression. London, Paris, Berlin, Warsaw and other capitals... We are strengthening our position everywhere, accumulating the support of our partners. I am sure that there will be a tribunal, there will be justice. We are moving quite actively with regard to another point of the Ukrainian peace formula – food security. We use every day so that the world sees and feels that global stability is possible only together with Ukraine. Today, the third vessel within the framework of our initiative Grain from Ukraine entered the port of Odesa. 25,000 tonnes of humanitarian wheat will be sent to Somalia. The second vessel, which is finishing loading in the port of Chornomorsk, will be heading to Ethiopia with 30,000 tonnes of wheat on board. Also, the first vessel under this program – Grain from Ukraine – is heading to Ethiopia. And in general, by the end of spring, we will send about 60 vessels with such humanitarian cargo. It literally saves millions of people from starvation. And I am grateful to all our partners who joined the Ukrainian initiative. Another initiative of ours – grain export – made it possible to bring almost 13 million tonnes of Ukrainian foodstuffs to the food market. A significant contribution to world security. We are doing everything to increase the supply. Today, I want to mention all those who are returning normal life to the liberated areas, in particular to Kherson region and the city of Kherson. These are people from different regions – everyone has united, responded to the call for relief... These are our energy workers, builders, communications workers, repair crews, businesses, local leaders, mine clearance specialists. More than 200 explosive devices were found in just a few days this week. Demining continues. In Kherson region, every week there is more mobile communication coverage, more electricity and gas supply, more transport opportunities. Every week more access to normal medicine, educational and social services. Today, the broadcast of the Ukrainian telethon Edyni Novyny also started in Kherson. I thank everyone who, despite constant Russian shelling and various attempts by terrorists to make difficulties for us, is doing everything so that Ukrainians can live – live normally. And one more. These days we celebrate the 300th anniversary of the birth of Hryhorii Skovoroda – our philosopher, who taught happiness and self-knowledge, finding one&#x27;s true self in this world. Today, I visited Pereiaslav, Kyiv region. Places where Skovoroda lived and taught. It would be funny if it weren&#x27;t bitter that the occupiers are trying to steal this Ukrainian from Ukraine. They say something there, as if Skovoroda is theirs. But we know that they will not catch him. How it&#x27;s impossible to catch, stop, break and capture Ukraine. These days we have taken some steps to guarantee the spiritual independence of our people. I see that people support these steps. And I see very powerful support. And that&#x27;s not all. There will be more steps. Ukraine will never stop halfway again. Glory to all who fight and work for our country! I thank everyone who defends and helps our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Our victory being achieved by strength of arms and spirit, by strength of our unity – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-03</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I held another meeting of the Staff. The commanders reported on the situation in specific directions – in the most important directions. In Donetsk region – Bakhmut, Soledar – now, as before, it&#x27;s the hottest, most painful. We do everything to help our boys in this direction. Our heroes who are holding the defense there. Everyone there deserves the highest gratitude! And now I would like to separately thank the border guards of the Chop detachment, who are fighting near Bakhmut and today &quot;landed&quot; another plane of the occupiers. Luhansk region and Kharkiv region – we&#x27;re strengthening our forces. South – we continue to erase the capabilities of the occupiers. Border – we&#x27;re strengthening the entire perimeter. Black Sea water area – we&#x27;re working so that finally Kalibr missiles could be at least at the bottom of the sea. Of course, we discussed further steps in the area of total spiritual independence of Ukraine and protection of our state from informal networks of influence of the terrorist state. A separate conversation at the meeting of the Staff is about energy. Recovery progress and object protection. We are constantly working on it. The discussion on price caps, i.e. on limiting the export price of Russian oil, has ended in the world. Unfortunately, without big decisions, as you wouldn&#x27;t call it a big decision to set such a limit for Russian prices, which is quite comfortable for the budget of a terrorist state. Russia has already caused huge losses to all countries of the world by deliberately destabilizing the energy market. And the world cannot dare its real energy disarmament. It&#x27;s a weak position. And it&#x27;s only a matter of time when stronger tools will have to be used anyway. It is a pity that this time will be lost. The logic is obvious: if the price limit for Russian oil is $60 instead of, for example, $30, which Poland and the Baltic countries talked about, then the Russian budget will receive about a hundred billion dollars a year. This money will go not only to the war and not only to Russia&#x27;s further sponsoring of other terrorist regimes and organizations. This money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those countries that are now trying to avoid big decisions. Today, I held a meeting with the leaders of our foreign policy bloc. We summed up the week and are preparing new events for December and January. Very powerful steps. Ukraine&#x27;s position will be heard, Ukraine&#x27;s interests will be realized despite everything. And one more. Yesterday I spoke with students of universities: Skovoroda University in Pereiaslav, Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, Skovoroda Kharkiv National Pedagogical University. Three institutions out of many that keep the memory of Skovoroda and preserve Ukrainianness itself. And today I also visited the exhibition &quot;The World of Skovoroda&quot; at the Ukrainian House in Kyiv. And it is right that in such conditions, in such a year, events for the 300th anniversary of Skovoroda are taking place all over the country. It is right that there is strength, there is the strength to take care of Ukrainian in all its manifestations. Because our victory is being achieved by the strength of arms and the strength of the spirit. The strength of the soldiers and the strength of the people. The strength of the state and the strength of culture. The strength of our unity is our ability to work together for the sake of Ukrainian interests and our ability to support each other. Support, because we are Ukrainians, and the strength of this argument alone should be enough for all of us. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to all who work for our country! Eternal memory and respect to all those who gave their lives for independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>To get through the winter, we have to be even more resilient and even more united - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-04</span></div>
  <p>Indomitable people of an indomitable country! The fourth day of this winter is coming to an end. The winter, which will obviously be difficult. But still, it is worth perceiving this winter not as a test, but as time - time that brings us closer to the main thing - to victory. Each of these 90 winter days. The enemy really hopes to use winter against us: to make winter cold and hardship part of his terror. We have to do everything to endure this winter, no matter how hard it is. And we will endure. To endure this winter is to defend everything. Russia still has missiles and an advantage in artillery. Yes, but we have something that the occupier does not have and will not have. We defend our home, and that gives us the strongest motivation possible. We fight for freedom, and that always multiplies any force. We defend the truth, and this unites the whole world around Ukraine. We see happy people when they meet the Ukrainian flag in liberated cities - wherever Ukraine returns. The people, the Armed Forces, all of us return. And this means they are waiting for us wherever there is still an occupation. They are waiting and they believe that Ukraine will return. They are waiting and they know very well: if Russia invades, it will not be forever. To get through this winter, we have to help each other more than ever and care for each other even more. And please don&#x27;t ask if you can help, and how. Just help when you see you can. To get through the winter, we have to be even more resilient and even more united than ever. There can be no internal conflicts and strife, which can weaken us all, even if someone out there thinks that somehow it will strengthen him personally. We need more interaction than ever. All of Ukraine has to become one big Point of Invincibility and work every day, work every night. The state, business, people - all of us, Ukrainians, all together. This autumn, a lot was done to strengthen the position of the state and to make the occupier lose. We must do everything so that the same can be said after this winter. Ukrainians worked round the clock to restore normal life after the Russian strikes. And no matter how large-scale the terror of the occupiers was, our desire to restore everything in our home was always even greater. It should continue to be so. Our defense forces firmly hold positions and even the most difficult directions. How many times have the occupiers planned to capture all of Donbas, to be in Bakhmut... How many times have they already announced new deadlines for their advance, their victories... Our guys are true heroes. And this is our key task - both for the state and the people - to do everything to support our defense forces, to strengthen our defense forces, to find everything necessary for our defense forces in the world. I know how difficult it is in Bakhmut, in Donbas. Guys, hold on! I am with you. The people are with you. In order to carry out this task - to carry it out successfully - we must always support each other, precisely for this. And I thank everyone who helps strengthen Ukraine and who after this winter will definitely be able to say that the approach of our victory is also his or her personal result, a personal achievement. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine and who work for Ukrainians! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Volunteers are the most powerful part of the civil society of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the International Volunteer Day</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-05</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today is International Volunteer Day. International, yet so Ukrainian. This is the day of millions of our people. Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions. This is the day of everyone who helps defend the state. Everyone who helps protect the people. All those who give their soul, time, and money for Ukraine and Ukrainians to succeed. To win. The volunteer movement in our country rose in waves from Maidan, from 2014 and from February 24. The waves that were getting higher and stronger. Today, volunteers are the most powerful part of Ukrainian civil society. This is a movement that unites all cities and communities of our country and all social groups. And this is an idea that attracts millions of people from different countries of the world to the Ukrainian struggle for freedom. Today is the day of very famous organizations, whose names every Ukrainian has heard, and the day of people whose names do not yet sound throughout the country, but who, together with everyone, will feel that this is their result on the day of our victory. This is the day of Veteran Hub and Army SOS, “Zgraya” and “Aerorozvidka”, KSE Foundation and those who founded and help “Nebesna Gvardiya” project. The day of &quot;Hospitallers&quot; and all paramedics and doctors who help at the front. This is the day of &quot;Kryla Peremogy&quot; and NGO &quot;Zemliachky&quot;, “Povernys Zhyvym&quot; and &quot;Motohelp&quot; foundations, Serhiy Prytula Foundation and the Volunteer Hundred of Dobrovolia, &quot;Kolo&quot; and &quot;Solomyanski Kotyky&quot; foundations, the Marlog Center and the Ukrainian Volunteer Service, Razom for Ukraine, &quot;Narodny Tyl&quot; association, Help Army volunteer group and the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. This is the day of United24 and each of the more than a hundred countries who help us buy ambulances or naval drones. This is the day of star ambassadors who have also become volunteers and direct the power of the world for Ukraine. Today is the day of Kharkiv “Pidtrymka Zakhysnykiv” Foundation and Lviv NGO “Nezalezhni”, the day of the Union of Ukrainian Women from the Ivano-Frankivsk region and the Kramatorsk Center “Razom do Peremohy”, “Angely Spasinnia” Foundation from the Donetsk region and NGO “Miskyi Tsentr Dopomohy” from Zaporizhzhia. This is the day of SpivDiia and PLAST, NGO &quot;Ridne Polissia&quot;, the Active Rehabilitation Group, the Ukrainian Women&#x27;s Battalion, &quot;Kotyky-Patriotyky&quot; and &quot;Dobra Sprava&quot;, Let&#x27;s help, &quot;Kharkiv z Toboyu&quot; foundations, HopeUA, &quot;Tvoya Opora&quot;, &quot;My z Ukrainoyu&quot; and &quot;Rayon Nomer 1&quot;. And also the day of Yevhen Subota, coordinator of volunteer centers in Hostomel. Ulyana Hredil from NGO &quot;Apostolska Chota&quot;. NGO &quot;Zakhyst - Obyednannia Volonteriv&quot;. Yulia Konovalova, head of NGO &quot;Liudy Usiudy&quot; and volunteer of the World Central Kitchen project. Volodymyr Firman, rector of Zarvanytsia Marian Spiritual Centre. This is the day of the Ukrainian Catholic University and dozens of universities and student communities in our country and abroad, which have joined the defense of our state, freedom and people. And humanity. That&#x27;s why today we thank organizations like Zoopatrol and UAnimals, and everyone who knows that saving animals is also saving souls. You probably know most of these names, you may have already helped some of these organizations and projects. But the volunteer movement is much larger and broader. These are thousands of structures, tens of thousands of people who care and millions of those who join. This is the day of those who were looking for bulletproof vests on Maidan and continued to look for and deliver everything that might be necessary for the frontline. This is the day of those who make camouflage nets: Lviv, Rivne and thousands of other Ukrainian cities and villages, tens of thousands of people. This is the day of ordinary Ukrainians who help us all solve very difficult tasks. They help restore the energy sector after strikes. Return normal life to the de-occupied territory. This is the day of those who provide rehabilitation and prosthetics. Who provide psychological help. Who support displaced persons. Who help those released from captivity. Who bake bread for the military and deliver food to the most dangerous places. This is the day of the drivers who helped with the evacuation and the delivery of the humanitarian aid. This is the day of many different people who all together strengthen Ukraine. This is the day of thousands of Ukrainian businesses that made their projects to help the army and ordinary people or joined existing volunteer programs. And the day of businessmen who do everything to strengthen Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, not Monaco and Vienna. Although the volunteer movement has become part of the foundation of Ukraine, we did not have a special award that could become a symbol of our gratitude to volunteers and those who give strength to this movement. Who give a part of their own life to help save the lives of others. Now there is such an award. This is the heart. The heart of gold for the ordinary people who protect us all. This year, we establish such an award. For those who really deserve it. Those whose hearts are of gold, and that is why they are volunteers. Today I named 50 volunteer groups whose representatives will receive an award this year. And every year we will celebrate volunteer projects, other organizations, and new personalities. People should know who provides this aid for Ukraine. People should know whose heart gives us such a result, for which Ukrainians are grateful. Glory to everyone who helps our defense! Glory to everyone who helps our volunteers! Gratitude to everyone who is involved in the work of the volunteers! And congratulations on Volunteer Day! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>When a terrorist destabilizes everyone&#x27;s lives, stopping terror is a joint task - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-05</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on the day. The main result - 70 Russian missiles were launched, most of them were shot down. Kalibr, Kh-101, etc. I am grateful to all our warriors of the air commands &quot;East&quot;, &quot;South&quot; and &quot;Center&quot;. Well done! I am also grateful to our partners for the air defense systems we are currently using. Every downed Russian missile is concrete proof that terror can be defeated. But, unfortunately, we still cannot ensure complete security to our sky - there were several hits. Unfortunately, there are victims. As of this time, there are four people killed by Russian strikes today. My condolences to families and friends. Energy workers immediately started restoration. Maximum efforts are in the central regions of Ukraine, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions. In many regions we had to switch to emergency shutdowns to stabilize the system. From Zakarpattia to Kyiv region, from Kirovohrad region to Sumy and Kharkiv regions. As of this evening, the biggest number of shutdowns is in Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy regions. But we will do everything to restore stability. Russian terror again affects neighboring states. There are interruptions with electricity supply in Moldova again. And this once again proves that Russia&#x27;s ability to carry out such massive terrorist attacks is a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to our entire region. At least. When one terrorist destabilizes everyone&#x27;s lives, stopping terror is a joint task. Tonight I will talk about this in my address to the expert community of the American Institute for the Study of War and to all our friends in the United States. By the way, with today’s missile attack Russia marked the anniversary of the Budapest Memorandum. The fate of this document gives answers to many current questions about Russia. Simply signing something with these terrorists will not bring peace. They will certainly break any agreements reached with them. Giving up any element of someone else’s security to Russia means new war. Therefore a principled continuation of the existing policy of conscientious states of the world is necessary: it is only the dismantling of Russian terrorist capacities, liberation of all our territories and holding the murderers to account that will bring peace. I believe we will come to this. Another result of today is a new declaration of support for Ukraine&#x27;s Euro-Atlantic course. This is the third such declaration. Today it was signed with Montenegro. After the Czech Republic and Belgium. We will complete this path step by step - we will persuade the Euro-Atlantic majority in favor of Ukraine. And not just in words, but in decisions. In decisions to support our accession to the collective security system. And one more thing Finally, a special award for extraordinary people appeared in Ukraine - for Ukrainian volunteers. &quot;Gold Heart&quot;. Today, greeting the volunteer community, I named the first 50 teams and individuals who will receive this new award shortly. But this is far from a complete list of those who deserve it. The state should know how to be grateful and express gratitude. And it will. Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Gratitude to everyone who helps our state hold out against Russian terror! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by terrorists! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Now our people will celebrate the Day of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with words of gratitude, feelings of gratitude, tears of gratitude - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-06</span></div>
  <p>Glory to Ukraine! Gentlemen, generals, officers, sergeants, soldiers! Fellow Ukrainians! Dear attendees! Today is the day of our gratitude. This is exactly the meaning of December 6 - and it is forever. Now, this is the only way our people will celebrate the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - with words of gratitude, feelings of gratitude, tears of gratitude. I am sure, millions of times today &quot;thank you&quot; was said or simply thought in Ukraine. I am thankful to the warriors of our army and all formations of the defense forces of Ukraine. I am thankful to the parents of our warriors who raised real winners. That&#x27;s that - winners. I am thankful to all the doctors and nurses who save the wounded heroes. I am thankful to everyone who strengthens the defense and provides Ukrainian warriors with everything they need. When the Day of the Armed Forces in a state is a holiday of gratitude, I am sure that such a state cannot be defeated and cannot be broken. And today we all see it for sure and have seen it again. Dear attendees! For 8 years and 286 days, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been defending our beautiful state from the occupier, from Russian aggression. Thousands of Ukrainians gave their lives for the day to come when not a single occupier remains on our land and all our people are free again. I ask you now to honor with a moment of silence the memory of everyone who died on the battlefield for the sake of our state, for the sake of Ukraine, and whose life became part of the heroic history of courage of Ukraine. Fellow Ukrainians! Today it is an honor for me to spend the whole day together with our defenders. In the morning, I was in the Donetsk region - I thanked the fighters who defend our state in the most dangerous and responsible directions. Those who are fighting in Svatove, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and other directions in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. I presented state awards and decorations to the warriors. I was in the Kharkiv region today - I thanked the doctors who save our indomitable fighters. In the Kharkiv region, I presented awards to the fighters who participated in the liberation of the region and who continue to expel the occupiers from Ukraine. Today we managed to bring home another 60 warriors who were in Russian captivity. We will continue to return our people and free everyone. Now here, in the Mariyinsky Palace, are our heroes, relatives of our warriors, commanders and representatives of combat brigades and units who have just arrived from the front and are returning to the frontline again. Where it&#x27;s really hot. Where they really fight for our freedom, for our independence, for our children. And I want to say to everyone present what is definitely in the heart of every Ukrainian today: I thank you! I thank absolutely all soldiers, all sailors, all sergeants, sergeant-majors, all officers, all heroes, generals and, of course, all your fathers and mothers, our dear, esteemed Ukrainian warriors. I wish you all one thing - victory! To all of us. You deserve it! All our people deserve it. All our parents, our children deserve it. Our state and history deserve it. To finally gain victory. Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Whoever started an unprovoked and criminal war must lose and bear responsibility - speech by the President of Ukraine at the Madeleine K. Albright Democracy Awards ceremony</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-07</span></div>
  <p>Dear friends! As I record this address, our 286th day of defense in full-scale war is ending. And this is not just an ordinary day – it is a holiday of our Armed Forces. A day celebrated by millions of Ukrainians – on their land, in their state, under their flag. Just feel it – the 286th day of a full-scale war against an aggressor that many in the world thought was invincible… And we celebrate the Day of OUR Armed Forces, not a sort of some kind a day of the occupiers. On February 23 of this year, a day before the escalation of the Russian war, madame Madeleine Albright published an opinion editorial that the Russian leader was making a historic mistake. These were prophetic words. He really made a mistake – the biggest in his life and the lives of modern generations of Russians. But, friends, we all know that the &quot;haunted idea&quot; of any dictatorship is to ignore mistakes and pretend that there were no mistakes, especially when it comes to the first-person error of the dictatorship. This is exactly how Russia is behaving now. Obviously, the dictator lost. But he is doing everything to ensure that Russia continues to fight if only to avoid admitting to himself and others that a historical mistake has been made. If Russia feels backed into a corner, it has only itself to blame. Ukraine and the free world should definitely not change their goals and exchange their values for some compromises, if the dictatorship is afraid to admit a mistake and tempts with a break in the battles. We must fully protect freedom and guarantee the security of our democracy. Whoever started an unprovoked and criminal war must lose and bear responsibility. Ukraine and the world must receive guarantees of peace, stability and security. Celebrating today the Day of our Armed Forces we feel we can provide this. And therefore, we must! Apart from the Ukrainian victory, any other option will be a mistake, and this must be honestly admitted. That is why we need to continue to have the same strong American leadership that we have seen during these 286 days and always. I believe that it will be so. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for this honorable title! And thank you to every American for always helping those who fight for freedom! God Bless America! God Bless Ukraine! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>The fate of millions of people who can be saved is being decided on the battlefield in Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-07</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! I greet you from Ukraine and thank you for supporting our fight for freedom! I want you to know what this support means. What American aid means to our defense against Russian terror. This is an opportunity for every Ukrainian to feel that freedom will reign on our land, and not the brutality of the occupier. This is an opportunity for every Ukrainian father and mother to be sure that child will choose his or her own path in life, and it will be a free life, not an endless fear of dictatorship. When we ask for support, it is always a request from people to people. On February 24, Russia started a total war against us, and this is a war for survival. Hundreds of our cities and villages were simply burned to the ground by Russian strikes. We have already managed to free from occupation one thousand eight hundred and eighty eight settlements. But almost as many Ukrainian towns and villages remain under occupation. And this means that now the fate of millions of people is being decided on the battlefield in Ukraine. Millions – who can be saved. We have no right to leave even a single Ukrainian under the Russian occupation! Not in Russian filtration camps, where thousands have already disappeared. And not on Russian territory, where hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians were forcibly deported... We can free them. This is our hope. This is what your support means. This is not about politics, this is about life. I will repeat these words once again – this is not about politics, this is about life. Isn&#x27;t that what real democracy is all about? There are always moments when it is necessary to say: this is not about politics, this is about life. There are always times when you need to support – because support means much more than just giving or doing something. Now is that very time – when support literally means saving, saving millions of people, millions of fathers and mothers, millions of children. And I am grateful to you for being with us – for the fact that the United States of America really support Ukraine. I believe that thanks to your support in particular, we will be able to say one day that all Ukraine is finally free and safe from Russian terror. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for the ripple of hope that we raised together this year! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Russia will be held to account for all stolen assets of the Ukrainian state and companies - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-07</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a long and hard day. The Kherson region - four policemen died during stabilization measures... Russian mines. Among the dead was Mykhailo Kuratchenko, chief of police of the Cherkasy region. He was helping colleagues in the south. EOD technician Ihor Melnyk. Dog trainer Serhiy Nenada. Assistant duty officer of the Uman district police department Vadym Perizhok. Doctors are currently saving the lives of four more policemen. Police forces along with all the defense forces of our state are now on the frontline. And together with everyone they protect Ukrainians, together with everyone they suffer losses... My condolences. The Donetsk region - today the Russian army carried out a very brutal, absolutely deliberate strike at Kurakhove. Precisely at civilians. At ordinary people. At the market, elevator, gas station, bus station, residential building. The list of the dead so far includes ten people, there are many wounded. My condolences to relatives and friends... Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror! I’ve held a meeting of the Staff today. Commanders&#x27; reports, analysis of the situation in specific directions. First of all, regarding the Donetsk region, Bakhmut districts and other hottest spots. A very fierce confrontation is ongoing there, every meter counts. I thank all our guys who destroy the enemy right there - every day, every night, every hour. Of course, due attention was paid to the Luhansk region and Kharkiv region at the Staff’s meeting, there were reports on the situation in general and on the borders. Energy sector is a permanent item on our agenda - both at the Staff and government levels. I’ve also held a meeting on the stabilization of the energy system and the protection of our power plants. We are constantly increasing the generation and supply of electricity - we are adding more volume almost every day. But we should not forget - and everyone should not forget - that it is now impossible to restore 100% of the energy system as it was before the beginning of the Russian energy terror. We need time. That is why shutdown schedules remain in most cities and districts. As of this evening, the biggest number of shutdowns is in Kyiv and the region, Lviv region, Zhytomyr region, Khmelnytskyi region, Poltava region, Vinnytsia region and Zakarpattia. And I thank all our energy workers, repairmen, businesses, utility workers and local authorities who are doing everything they can to make things easier for people. By the way, today is the Day of Local Self-Government. This is a holiday for all those who work with people directly and on whom almost everything in communities depends. As in any government, in local self-government there are different people of different personal qualities and views. And today I thank all those who, at their level, really protect their communities. Who can be trusted and to whom people come for help. Who really takes care of the defense - within their responsibility - and who prepares everything so that his or her community can get through this winter more easily. Thank you and congratulations on your professional day. Today we have a very important result in France. The Supreme Court of France upheld the decision on recovery in favor of the Ukrainian Oschadbank from the aggressor state. The amount with accrued interest is almost 1.5 billion dollars. This legal process has been dragging since 2015. More than six years of struggle, tens of thousands of pages of legal documents, many hopes and no less skepticism expressed by some... But there is this victory for Ukraine. Russia will be held to account for all stolen assets of the Ukrainian state and companies. This is the first victory for a state-owned company in the legal cases against Russia concerning the seized property in Crimea, and I thank each and every one who secured this result. Today, representatives of the Office and the government took part in a conference in America - a conference dedicated to the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Similarly, not everyone in the world agrees now that this tribunal will work. But no matter what they say, we will do our part and will definitely achieve a result for Ukraine and Ukrainians. We are already preparing for the events of the second half of the week - at the international level. There will be important decisions for our defense. We do everything to make them stronger. I am grateful to all partners of our country! Glory to all who work for the victory! Glory to each of our warriors - to all those who obtain life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is an honor for me to represent all Ukrainians - President&#x27;s speech at the annual announcement of the list of the most influential people in Europe Politico 28</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-08</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! I thank you for this award to the Ukrainian people. And I mean it – it is destined to all Ukrainians. Because leaders can be truly influential only when they represent not only themselves, but the common will, common dream, common goal of their people. This is how we live in Ukraine. We are as united as possible – and that is why we are that strong. We are focused on protecting our independence – and that is why we are achieving our goals. We have faced the threat of losing everything – and that is why we have found the strength to become number one. The Ukrainian military, who protect us all on the battlefields, are number one. Maryinka, Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Soledar, Kreminna – please remember these names... that is where freedom is now being fought for. For all of us in Europe. In hard battles and at the cost of many lives. Ukrainian businessmen who, despite the total war, supply everything necessary for the life of the country, protect jobs and pay taxes, are number one. And I thank all our friends in Europe who help us maintain stability. Ukrainian doctors, energy workers, sappers, volunteers, drivers and builders, defense workers, teachers, policemen, diplomats... Hundreds of thousands of those who help millions live through this terrible time – they are number one. And it is an honor for me to represent all these people. All Ukrainians. And guide our common will for our common dream. For the sake of a common goal... For the sake of Ukraine&#x27;s victory in this war. For the sake of rebuilding Ukraine. For the full accession of Ukraine to the community of European nations – to our European Union. I believe that Ukrainians will be the most influential next year as well. But – already in peacetime. Thanks to everyone who supports us! Thank you, Politico, for being always unbiased! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>I am sure that mine terror will be among the charges against Russia for aggression - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-08</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! I have just signed the decrees on awarding posthumously the policemen whose lives were taken yesterday in the Kherson region by Russian mines. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to police colonel Mykhailo Kuratchenko. Orders &quot;For Courage&quot; - to police captains Ihor Melnyk and Serhiy Nenada and police corporal Vadym Perizhko. Once again, my condolences… They did everything for the safety of Ukrainians. Already returning after completing one of the tasks, when they removed weapons and ammunition from the cache of the occupiers, many of which were left in the Kherson region, the policemen stumbled upon a mine trap. And this is the form of Russian terror that will have to be countered for years to come. Terrorists deliberately try to leave behind as many death traps as possible. Buried landmines, tripwire mines, mined buildings, cars and infrastructure... This is more than 170 thousand square kilometers of dangerous territory. I am sure: this will be among the charges against Russia for aggression - precisely mine terror. Which is even more cruel and meaner than a missile one, because there is no anti-mine system that could destroy at least part of the threat, as our air defense does. I am grateful to all our partners who help Ukraine with demining. Canada, Japan, Great Britain, Slovakia, ambassadors and donors of United24 and many others who understand how important it is that Ukraine is not left alone with the problem of the territory mined by the occupiers. I met today with representatives of Slovakia, the government delegation - ministers of foreign affairs, defense and economy. We discussed the existing cooperation between our states both at the bilateral level and in the structures of the European Union. We agreed on new solutions for the sake of our common security and political interests. We are actively working to support and strengthen the next sanctions against Russia – by European, American and other partners. The issue of the ninth EU sanctions package is currently in progress. We are also waiting for other decisions, in particular, regarding schemes for circumventing anti-war sanctions, including financial and energy ones. We are preparing several important events - for tomorrow and next week. Protecting and restoring the rights of our people, rebuilding Ukraine are constant priorities. The next week will be quite important for Ukraine in terms of these two tasks. I thank all those who fight for freedom! I thank everyone who strengthens our state and helps our people! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The spirit of Ukraine is the spirit of freedom that echoes in the souls of people around the world - President&#x27;s speech at the Time event dedicated to the announcement of remarkable people and events of 2022</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-09</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! It is an honor for me – to represent the struggle of Ukrainians and the Spirit of Ukraine. The spirit of freedom, that echoes in the souls of so many people around the world... Stories of heroes, who are fighting for independence, are also – your stories. Ordinary men and women who became brave-hearts, when they joined the Defence Forces to defend freedom, – different generations of different nations knew this spirit. Doctors, who save the wounded under bombs, during blackouts or in occupation – no matter what it takes. It is about humanness, that we all value so dearly. Farmers, who work the land under the roaring guns. It is about natural desire to live and take care of one’s families and communities. Journalists, who spread the truth – it is in the history of how to resist tyrants. The history, which began even before the word “journalism” appeared. This is what inspires across all continents – freedom fighters, who may possess nothing, but courage to defeat those with armored vehicles and repression experience. When freedom wins and tyranny collapses, people are smiling the same way all over the globe. Lawyers, who do not yet see the upcoming victory in war, but are already working to ensure that war criminals are brought to justice, – this is the Nuremberg Trials story with many other just verdicts, that were delivered to those, who believed in their impunity. This is the spirit! You have already seen the spirit of Ukraine on the covers of Time Magazine – not on each one, but on many. They were not Ukrainians – on the covers before, but they were – courage, striving for freedom, solidarity, creativity and dedication, – values well known to the mankind from a long time ago and which united the world this year with the colors of the Ukrainian national flag and our people’s achievements. This is the free world spirit. And let&#x27;s do everything for our spirit to win! I thank you for your attention! Thank you for supporting Ukraine! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Guaranteeing the security of the Mykolaiv region and its ports will be the next step towards ensuring global food security - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the TRT World Forum 2022 in Istanbul</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-09</span></div>
  <p>Mr. President Erdoğan! Mr. Prime Minister Rama! Dear friends! Thank you for your attention to Ukraine and now I would like to address the entire audience gathered by this Forum. A powerful audience. Powerful is not a random word now, it is a key word. A word that reflects our capabilities - of Ukraine, Türkiye, the Black Sea region. Capabilities right now - and in the future years and decades. The Russian war against Ukraine showed the value of stability in our region. This is one of the historical mistakes of the Russian leader - with his insane aggression, he only proved that the security of Ukraine and the Black Sea region is critically important for global security, and any aggression in our part of the world is a global crime. The food crisis that the world has experienced this year and that we are overcoming together with Türkiye and the UN fully illustrates what I am talking about. There would not be any severity of the food crisis if the Russian fleet had not blocked our ports in the Black Sea. Without the export of our food, the global market is instantly destabilized. This was felt by various countries in Africa and Asia, and this was manifested in food price fluctuations in other parts of the planet. But thanks to our brave warriors who are changing the balance of power in the confrontation with Russia and thanks to the power of diplomacy, we managed to resume sea exports from the three Black Sea ports of Ukraine. Since July of this year, we have already exported more than 13 million tons of agricultural products to 40 countries around the world. The global market felt it. In the end, it was also reflected in social stability in the respective countries consuming our food. That’s what our power is. Ukraine, Türkiye, the UN - together they are preventing the threat of famine, which so much has been said about. When we jointly take care of the security of our region, of normal life in our region, it provides, as a result, elements of global security. It provides the elements of peace that all conscientious states need. Recently, at the G19 summit in Indonesia, I presented the Ukrainian Peace Formula. A formula that can put an end to Russian aggression and restore the force of international law for Ukraine and all other nations. Food security is one of the elements of our Peace Formula. And this is something where the leadership role of Türkiye can manifest itself one hundred percent. If we manage not only to maintain the current level of agricultural exports from Ukraine and our humanitarian initiative - &quot;Grain From Ukraine&quot; - which helps the poorest countries maintain stability, but also to restore the full-fledged export of Ukrainian food in the volume that the world needs. Now there are more than 13 million tons of agricultural products for export. And we can ensure tens of millions of tons more. Our ports involved in the grain export initiative are operating at half capacity only. And this is only because Russia slows down the implementation of exports - it keeps ships waiting for &quot;inspections&quot;. As of today, more than 80 ships are waiting. And this is not just something about trade. This means that hundreds of thousands of people have less food on their tables. This means that hundreds of thousands of people overpay for food. Why? Only because one state blackmails everyone with food. The average waiting period for ships is 3-5 weeks. Because of this, 2-3 million tons of Ukrainian agricultural products are under-exported every month. Does our region have the potential to solve this? It definitely has. And if we manage to eliminate several more vectors of Russian aggression against Ukraine and guarantee the safety of our Mykolaiv region, in particular the ports of the region, this will be another step towards a more complete guarantee of global food security. Is there potential for this in the Black Sea region? There is, too. This could be a move by Türkiye - a diplomatic move. Ladies and Gentlemen! The fact that we manage to implement such initiatives as the grain export initiative and the &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; humanitarian initiative gives us a format for implementing other similar initiatives, other points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula. The main thing is leadership. The main thing is not just to know about your power, not just to demonstrate it occasionally, but to direct its potential for the sake of peace. The Ukrainian Peace Formula is formulated in such a way that its points allow each state and each leader to choose the aspect in which the determination of this particular state and this leader can work. I suggest that all our partners choose points for themselves - so that the entire peace formula is implemented. So that step by step - as with grain initiatives - we achieve the security architecture we need. Guarantee radiation and nuclear security. Guarantee food security. Guarantee energy security, stop insane Russian missile terror. Guarantee the release of all prisoners, the return of all deportees. By the way, Türkiye and President Erdoğan have already helped us significantly with this point - we are grateful for that. The next point of our Peace Formula is to guarantee the implementation of the UN Charter and the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Guarantee the withdrawal of Russian troops from the occupied land and thereby stop hostilities. Guarantee justice - by punishing those guilty of terror and compensating for damages. Guarantee effective countermeasures against ecocide and save the Black Sea region from environmental disasters that may become a repercussion of the Russian war. Guarantee the prevention of any escalation and the durability of peace after dismantling all elements of Russian aggression. The Ukrainian Peace Formula is clear. Does it look unrealistic? Not at all. It looks now just as the idea of renewing grain exports from our seaports looked in May of this year. Already in July, exports resumed - thanks to our joint power. Let this power work in everything else that is needed for peace! Thank you, Türkiye, for your support! Thank you, Mr. President! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>There must be a single legal front that will overcome Russia&#x27;s genocidal policy - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s speech at &quot;UA: Human Rights in Dark Times&quot; International Conference in Kyiv</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-09</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear colleagues! Dear attendees, guests! Dear journalists! It is good that today there is a format of such an important Conference, exactly today - on International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of this Crime and on the eve of Human Rights Day. On December 9, 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. And the next day, on December 10, 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 74 years, the norms of these and many other similar documents have united the world community. More than 150 countries have become parties to the Genocide Convention. More than 190 countries have endorsed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But is the world really united around the ideas that were the basis of these documents? As a matter of fact, there was no such unification around ideas, around values. We felt it after the beginning of the Russian war against people, humanity, against our state. Against all living things. We felt that many things that should work and protect against such a genocidal policy existed rather as, pardon, a formality. As a legacy from the old days that was simply dusted off when it was time for the annual celebrations. But now we are changing that. Together with everyone who today helps us, Ukraine and Ukrainians. And we are changing that not only for ourselves. This is a very important point. Again - for people, for humanity, for life. Every time we unite the world to protect Ukraine, to protect Ukrainians, every time we achieve decisions on the implementation of fundamental international norms, every time we manage to fill international institutions and rules with real power and energy, we achieve results - for Ukrainians and great results for the whole world. For everyone who may be threatened by this or that form of aggression. This or that manifestation of genocidal policy. This or that strike of terror. Defending ourselves against Russia now, we are turning the words of many conventions and declarations into concrete actions for the sake of people and, again, for the sake of humanity. By saving Ukrainians from Russia, we give hope to many other people, many other communities, other nations who feel that the same aggression could be launched against them. Working to bring the Russian Federation to just responsibility for aggression, for war crimes, for acts of its genocidal policy, we are creating mechanisms for the implementation of the norms of international law, which will actually serve to prevent international crimes and establish justice for decades after the end of this war, after our victory - the victory of Ukraine and the world. Ladies and Gentlemen! That is why we need the broadest possible cooperation. Both in our society and at the international level. The crimes of the Russian state on the territory of Ukraine and specifically against Ukrainians are unprecedented since World War II. Ukrainian cities, our towns, our villages, which the Russian artillery simply crashes into stones... Not one, not two - but dozens of such destroyed cities and villages. Aviation and missile terror, strikes by the Russian Federation, which are so reminiscent of the Nazi bombing of Britain and London. Of all the missiles launched by the Russian army since February 24, 62% were directed specifically against civilian objects, against people, against humanity. And there are also filtration camps. Real, modern torture chambers and mass burials of people were revealed. Forced deportation of Ukrainians to Russia - more than 2 million people were deported. Illegal adoption by Russian families of our Ukrainian children who were actually kidnapped from Ukraine. Criminal mobilization of Ukrainian citizens in the occupied territories into the occupation army. Mine terror against Ukrainians. Constant shelling, victims in the border area with the Russian Federation and in the frontline areas... All this is such a terrible scale of crimes committed and the destinies and lives of people destroyed. All this is a tragedy of such magnitude. To restore justice, our state needs the maximum possible cooperation of everyone - cooperation with the human rights community, with all international partners. There must be a single legal front that will overcome Russia&#x27;s genocidal policy. And that is why, addressing you and every day, I call on all government officials and all representatives of civil society who care about people, who care about humanity, representatives of various organizations, representatives of international human rights organizations, agencies to work now in a coordinated manner, together at all levels, together - for the sake of restoring the rights of people violated by the war, the rights of Ukrainians and for bringing the aggressor to justice, mandatory and fair. We have to find such a formula for cooperation, so that there is a maximum result for our state and for the international legal order. And I am glad that Chris Field is present among us today - it’s my pleasure, good afternoon - President of the International Ombudsman Institute, a representative of a system whose potential can provide much more for the protection of human rights for Ukraine. Let me explain what I mean. For example, the Ukrainian Ombudsman, Mr. Dmytro Lubinets, is now very actively involved in the work of our joint team - Budanov, Yermak, Malyuk - regarding the release of our prisoners of war, the release of our civilians held captive in Russia or in temporarily occupied territories. We have already managed to return 1,331 Ukrainian warriors. And I am very proud of this result of our country. Protecting people wherever they are - we have to bring everyone back. This is our duty. And at a time when, to put it mildly, we do not see determination and concrete actions in the relevant processes from such organizations as the International Committee of the Red Cross, we have to search and find new people in new realities, new formats of interaction, new lines of cooperation. Perhaps this system - the system of ombudsmen and the international component of cooperation in this system will be able to bring us closer to the result we strive for - the return home of all Ukrainians: adults, children, prisoners of war, political prisoners - all those forcibly detained in the territory of the Russian Federation and temporarily occupied territories of our country. It&#x27;s worth at least a try. I think so. We have to try to make efforts every day, because all these are steps forward to victory. Until recently, many did not believe that the ratification of one of the fundamental documents for the protection of human rights and equality of all communities, the Istanbul Convention, was possible in Ukraine. Now it is a reality in Ukraine - the convention has been ratified. Until recently, many people said that Ukraine would allegedly not be able to obtain the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. Now it is a reality. We have become closer to European institutions. I am also proud of it. I am proud of all the people who worked for such results. Until recently, talks dominated Europe that the European Union would allegedly not be able to really unite to protect our common interests, common values, our people... Until recently, skepticism about UN structures was spreading in the world. Today, we see that the European Union is capable of being truly strong and united. And the power of the UN can be directed to solve real problems - we are talking about global problems, such as the food crisis. This is what happens when we take up the cause together, when our state, Ukraine, takes up the cause. We must always keep faith in ourselves and our partners. We must be absolutely determined, principled, we must be open to cooperation with everyone who also values determination and principles. This is how we will get all the results we so desperately need for Ukraine, for Europe, and for humanity. A Special Tribunal for the crime of aggression by the Russian Federation against the state of Ukraine must be established. And I call on all of you to do everything so that the maximum majority in the UN General Assembly supports the corresponding draft resolution in order to establish this desired and necessary justice. A compensation mechanism must also be launched to provide compensation for all losses at the expense of the assets of the aggressor, at the expense of the Russian Federation, for all those who suffered from this war of Russia against Ukraine. The relevant resolution is endorsed by the UN General Assembly, and I ask everyone to contribute to its maximum implementation. All Russian murderers, all those who organized and implemented this genocidal policy and terror must be brought to justice. For this purpose, I urge you to cooperate with the Office of the Prosecutor General, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, with our partners who are investigating the crimes of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, and with the International Criminal Court. I am sure that together we will implement absolutely all of this - we will ensure justice for Ukraine, for each and every one. I thank everyone who works for the sake of Ukrainians! For the sake of life. Glory to all our heroic strong warriors! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by Russian terror! Glory to Ukraine! Thank you.</p>

  <h2>To involve the world in the implementation of the peace formula is now one of the key tasks for Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-09</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I had an important conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak today. We coordinated our positions ahead of the summit next week. In fact, this will be the final G7 summit this year, and it will determine the priorities for the next year. We are preparing as many as possible solutions that our countries need – for Ukraine and for the G7 states. I also thanked Mr. Prime Minister and the entire United Kingdom for the constant support of our state. They discussed the situation on the front line and winter prospects on the battlefield. The front-line situation remains very difficult in the key areas of Donbas – Bakhmut, Soledar, Maryinka, Kreminna... For a long time, there is no living place left on the land of these areas that has not been damaged by shells and fire. The occupiers actually destroyed Bakhmut, another Donbas city that the Russian army turned into burnt ruins. I thank all our heroes, all soldiers and commanders who hold the front in these directions, repulse attacks and inflict significant losses on the enemy in response to the hell that entered Ukraine under the Russian flag. Today, a conference was held in Kyiv, which continued the line of events in our country and in Europe that took place this week and last week, during which we work out solutions for the sake of justice, for the sake of holding Russia accountable, and for the sake of finding formats for the release of our people, who are held captive by the occupiers. We feel support from both states and international organizations and human rights institutions. We hope to be able to announce specific details in the near future. By the way, the results of the visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to London and her speech in the British Parliament were discussed with the British Prime Minister. On behalf of our country, Olena proposed that the United Kingdom shows leadership in the issue of justice – in the creation of a special tribunal to try the crime of Russian aggression. This is one of the points of the Ukrainian peace formula, and it is very important for me to see now in international communication that global leaders have really heard Ukrainian peace proposals. Let me remind you that the peace formula consists of ten points – from nuclear security to the restoration of the territorial integrity of our state, from energy security to the return of all prisoners of war and deportees held on the territory of Russia. This is now one of the key tasks for our state – to involve the world in concrete implementation of the points of the peace formula. We must return the Ukrainian flag to all cities and communities of Ukraine, we must ensure the real responsibility of the terrorist state for this war, and we must guarantee the safety of all generations of Ukrainians after the end of this war. Every day of the heroic resistance of our Defense Forces and all our people brings closer the day when the entire Ukraine will finally experience victory, victory and peace. Real, reliable. Today, I presented the Ukrainian vision of steps towards peace at the TRT World Forum in Istanbul. There I focused on food security – on Ukrainian initiatives that add global weight to our state. This is the grain export initiative and the Grain from Ukraine initiative. Using these transparent and useful examples for our people, for the Black Sea region and for the entire global community, we show that it is quite possible to restore security. The main thing is determination. I am sure that Mr. President Erdoğan, who was at the forum, heard our position. We are already preparing for a very important next week – there will be important international events. I held relevant meetings today. I believe: there will be powerful decisions for our country. Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thanks to everyone who works for our people! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Currently there is acute shortage in power system, but our energy and utility crews doing heroic things – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-10</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! The key for today is energy. The situation in Odesa region is very difficult. After the night strike by Iranian drones, Odesa and other cities and villages of the region are in the dark. So far, more than 1.5 million people in Odesa are without electricity. Only critical infrastructure is connected and to the extent where it is possible to supply electricity. In total, Russian terrorists used 15 Shahed drones against Odesa. During one night on Saturday. This is the true attitude of Russia towards Odesa, towards Odesa residents – deliberate bullying, deliberate attempt to bring disaster to the city. Our sky defenders managed to shoot down 10 drones out of 15. Well done! Power engineers, repair crews, regional authorities – everyone is working non-stop to restore power. Unfortunately, the hits were critical, so it takes more than just a period of time to restore electricity... It doesn&#x27;t take hours, but a few days, unfortunately. We will do everything we can to speed up the recovery. Please, while the repairs are in progress, help your friends, your neighbors, and the elderly in Odesa to find and use the Points of Invincibility. Points of Invincibility are deployed. There you can warm up, charge your equipment, get access to mobile communication, get the necessary, important support. In general, both emergency and stabilization power outages continue in various regions. The power system is now, to put it mildly, very far from a normal state – there is an acute shortage in the system. That is why there are blackout schedules. The largest number is in the Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Ternopil, Sumy, Zakarpattia, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytsky regions and in the city of Kyiv. It must be understood: even if there are no heavy missile strikes, this does not mean that there are no problems. Almost every day in different regions there are shelling, there are missile attacks, drone attacks. Energy facilities are hit almost every day. Due to losses in the system, everyone in the system has to reduce the limits. Recovery is also very difficult. But still, our energy and utility crews are doing truly heroic things, restoring in weeks what would have required months of work. And I thank each who is working to restore power and save the power system. I also thank everyone who realizes how hard it is for our defenders of the sky, how hard it is for the repair crews and very hard for the energy workers, how hard it is for everyone who protects our lives. Today, we have important news from Norway. There is a new support package from this country in the amount of $100 million. And precisely for the restoration of our energy system after these Russian strikes. I thank all Norwegians for this decision. I&#x27;m thankful to the government. In general, we receive defense, economic and very important political support from Norway, as well as a lot of humanitarian assistance. Norway also helps with the purchase of gas. We will work together on the reconstruction of Ukraine. I want to thank you once again. Today, in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, the annual ceremony of awarding the Nobel Peace Prize took place. This year, the language of Ukraine, our Ukrainian language, was heard for the first time at the ceremony – thanks to the Center for Civil Liberties and its head Mrs. Matviichuk, who became laureates of the Peace Prize. I congratulate Ms. Oleksandra, her colleagues and all Ukrainian human rights defenders on this recognition. It is symbolic that the ceremony takes place on this very day – International Human Rights Day. In Ukraine, before there was no national day of gratitude and respect for the human rights movement – all those who dedicate their lives to the protection and restoration of people&#x27;s rights. Now such a day has been established and will be celebrated annually on December 10 – Human Rights Day. Earlier, I signed several more important decrees. In particular, about awarding state scholarships. And Mr. Edem Bekirov was awarded the state scholarship named after Levko Lukyanenko. This is a special scholarship with which the state supports those who were released from the captivity of the occupiers, who were saved from Russian repression. Outstanding figures of our science, culture, and art have been awarded other state scholarships. A total of 100 Ukrainian men and women. I thank everyone who works for our country! Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine and thanks to whom we can live and work! Eternal memory to all those who died for our freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I propose to convene the Global Peace Formula Summit to determine how we can implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula - address by the President to the G7 leaders</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-12</span></div>
  <p>I thank you, Mr. Chancellor, for your words of support and for convening this summit. For the opportunity to thank all of you, dear friends, for not losing Ukraine this year! Just as for not losing Europe and the world based on fair rules. Millions of our people are fighting and working for the sake of freedom. It is thanks to your support that Ukrainian invincibility has gained so much strength. Today I want to acknowledge the leadership of each of you as well as the solidarity of the entire Group of Seven. I am grateful to the United States and all Americans for the large-scale military and economic support as well as the support with sanctions. The US has united the free world and established a solid foundation of our security solidarity. Thank you, Mr. President! Our phone call yesterday was substantive, thank you very much. I am grateful to Canada and all Canadians for making every Ukrainian feel the sheer power of our friendship. Thank you for solidarity in understanding that Russian aggression is a no local event, but a truly global threat - a threat to everyone on Earth. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I am grateful to Japan and every Japanese for the strong leadership in Asia for the sake of protecting the freedom and basic norms of international law, as well as for the solidarity over the point that no threats brought by the Russian war should ruin the lives of our nation and all other nations of this planet. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I am grateful to the United Kingdom and all of His Majesty&#x27;s subjects for being the first in Europe to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons, for solidarity in building a powerful army, and for the unwavering belief in the victory over evil. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister! I am grateful to France and all the French people for reinforcing our artillery and for supporting Ukraine both nationally and at the level of local communities. I am grateful for your solidarity in the vision of the European future - free and equal for all the nations of our continent. Thank you, Mr. President! I am grateful to Italy and all Italians for the timely and unhesitating provision of security and financial support. I am grateful to you for solidarity in respect for human dignity, because Russia wants to deprive all free nations of their dignity, and not only in Europe. Thank you, Madam Prime Minister! I am grateful to Germany and every German for the wonderful IRISes and for everything that helps us save people and maintain social stability despite Russia’s terror. No matter how Russia would blackmail us, we are confident about German solidarity in condemning the genocidal policy of Russia remaining strong. Thank you, Mr. Chancellor! Mr. Michel! Mrs. Ursula! I thank the European Union, you personally and every EU country for uniting our community in an unprecedented way and gradually providing Europe with even more strength and confidence that freedom in Europe will not yield to any tyranny. This year, Ukraine gained the status of the EU candidate and received the much-needed economic assistance and support with sanctions from Europe. I believe we will continue to cherish this solidarity of values. Dear colleagues! I am asking you to preserve this level of solidarity for the next year. Russia continues its aggression - and therefore, the support for Ukraine must be continued. Next year just as it was this year. But we must also take long-awaited steps to accelerate the coming of peace. Let me name those steps. There are three of them. The first is a new force. Unfortunately, Russia still has the advantage in artillery and missiles. This is a fact. These capabilities of the occupying army are the ones to fuel the Kremlin&#x27;s arrogance. But we can overcome this. Ukraine needs modern tanks - and I ask you to provide this defensive capability to us. It can be done right now. Ukraine needs constant artillery support with guns and shells. It will not allow escalation from the Russian’s side. We need more rocket artillery and more long-range missiles. The more effective we are with such weapons, the shorter the Russian aggression will be. The second is a new resilience. We must maintain financial, energy and social stability next year. Should we not lose in these aspects, we will win in everything else. The reliable protection of the Ukrainian energy sector from Russian missiles and Iranian drones will be the protection of the whole of Europe, because with these strikes Russia provokes a humanitarian and migration catastrophe not only for Ukraine, but for the whole EU. I call upon you to increase the assistance to Ukraine in the field of gas. The terror against our power plants forced us to use more gas than expected. This is why we need additional support over this particular winter. We are talking about the volume of about two billion cubic meters of gas – that has to be procured additionally. We must be more active with reconstruction. It will clearly demonstrate the true capabilities of the democratic system to the whole world. The third is a new diplomacy. Ukraine has always led the negotiation process and did everything to stop Russian aggression. Now we feel the opportunity to use diplomacy to bring the liberation of all our people and all our territories closer. At the G20 summit in Indonesia, I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula - 10 clear points that are quite realistic to implement. For the sake of peace, peace in Ukraine, in Europe, and in the world. You are all aware of those 10 points. I am grateful to you for supporting this initiative. I propose to convene a special summit - Global Peace Formula Summit - to determine how and when we can implement the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula. I invite you, as well as other conscientious countries, to show your leadership in the implementation of the Peace Formula as a whole or some specific points in particular. I propose Russia to take a concrete and meaningful step towards a diplomatic settlement, which is being mentioned by Moscow so regularly. Very soon we’ll have holidays celebrated by billions of people. Christmas - according to the Gregorian calendar or the New Year and Christmas - according to the Julian calendar. This is the time for normal people to think about peace, not aggression. I suggest Russia to at least try to prove that it is capable of abandoning the aggression. It would be right to start the withdrawal of Russian troops from the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine this Christmas. If Russia withdraws its troops from Ukraine, it will ensure a lasting cessation of hostilities. I hope that you will support our call. Because it is in a global interest. This is part of our Peace Formula. The occupier must leave. It will certainly happen. I see no reason why Russia should not do it now – at Christmas. The answer from Moscow will show what they really want – further confrontation with the world of finally cessation of the aggression. The one who brought the war upon us has to take it away. In any case, no matter what Russia responds, it is we, the free world, who should keep the initiative just as it was throughout this year – since February 24th. I thank you for your attention! I thank Germany for this very effective chairmanship and I believe that Japan&#x27;s chairmanship will be absolutely effective as well. Thank you once again for your historic support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Blackouts are the last hope of terrorists, but even without light, we know well where to shoot and what to liberate – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-12</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report about the day that is coming to an end. First, I congratulated the warriors and commanders of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on their professional holiday. Today is their day. In the Mariyinsky Palace, I presented state awards - &quot;Gold Star&quot; orders, &quot;Cross of Combat Merit&quot; decorations, and other awards. And it was an emotional ceremony. There were relatives of the Heroes who gave their lives in battles against the invaders. There were warriors who would return to the frontline. And there was such a special moment when we all felt what united us and how much we were all waiting for our victory. The victory will definitely come. The second important event of the day was participation in the G7 leaders&#x27; summit. The Group of Seven. This is already the fifth such summit this year, in which Ukraine participates and fully presents its position. Today, we specifically outlined what we have to do next year. I thanked the partners and urged them to continue to help Ukraine in 2023 as they did this year. It is very important that all elements of support for our state are preserved and do not lose momentum. It is equally important to take new steps that will preempt the Russian terror. One of the main such steps is the summit, which we are planning for this winter. A summit on the implementation of our Peace Formula. No matter what the aggressor intends to do, when the world is truly united, it is the world, not the aggressor, that determines future developments. This is what we offer to all conscientious states. To everyone who values the UN Charter and simply peace. Thirdly, representatives of our state are already working in France. The head of the government, the First Lady of Ukraine and others. The key task is two conferences on the reconstruction and resilience of Ukraine, on getting through this winter. They will take place tomorrow. And also - the direction of French forces - both of the state and businesses, communities of France - to specific projects on the recovery of Ukraine. Energy sector, cities, enterprises, hospitals... So now is an important time in France for our country, and tomorrow I will also take part in the relevant events. And other extremely important things. Today, three of our EOD technicians - employees of the State Emergency Service - died in the Donetsk region during demining. My condolences to the relatives... Doctors are fighting for the lives of two more of their colleagues. It happened in Kostyantynivka, Kramatorsk district. One of our territories most contaminated by Russian landmines, tripwire mines and unexploded shells. Since February 24, employees of the State Emergency Service alone have removed more than 300,000 explosive items. The EOD technicians of the National Police removed more than 180,000 such items. And demining is also carried out by other state services and the army. And this is one of the most important areas of our communication with partners. Among other things, we must gather the maximum of global capabilities to overcome the Russian mine terror as soon as possible. And I thank once again all our partners who help. I am thankful to all our heroic employees of the State Emergency Service, our police, and the military who carry out demining. Every defused Russian mine, every disposed projectile, every detected and defused tripwire mine is the saved lives of our people. Every day we add new energy forces to Ukraine. After each Russian attack, we restore the system. As much as possible. We are doing everything to bring to Ukraine as much equipment as possible, which can compensate for the damage caused by missile hits. And I thank all Ukrainian entrepreneurs, volunteers, all our partners who help with this. But we should all be aware that Russia has not given up its terror tactics. The absence of massive missile strikes only means that the enemy is preparing for them and can strike at any time. Although it is obvious that even without light we know well where to shoot and what to liberate, Russia still hopes for blackouts. This is the last hope of terrorists... So as long as they have missiles - and Russia still has them - please take seriously all warnings from the Ukrainian military command, from our Air Force and air alarms. At all levels, we must be prepared for any hostile intentions. And we will do everything to get through this winter. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! I thank everyone who works for our victory! Glory to all who fight for independence! Eternal memory to every Ukrainian whose life was taken by this war! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We need the Paris Mechanism, which will help give timely responses to the challenges of Russian energy terror - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of &quot;In solidarity with the Ukrainian People&quot; conference</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-13</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much! Dear President Macron! Mrs. President von der Leyen! President Cassis! Prime Minister Støre! Prime Minister Hun Sen! Prime Minister Bettel! Prime Minister Fiala! Dear heads of international institutions! Prime Minister Shmyhal! Dear Olena! All attendees, ministers, ambassadors! I am glad that we are united by such a new format - such a Conference. Because this means that we are united by the ability to defeat Russian energy terror. I remember how you, Emmanuel, called me on November 1 and offered to organize such a format. There have already been massive missile strikes against our energy sector. The constant terror of Iranian drones has already begun. Russia has opened a new front against us, trying to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe of the scale of our entire country. Russia needs a blackout in Ukraine to use it as an alleged defeat of Europe and all our democratic resistance. In response, we established a new format of cooperation and do everything for the sake of the country, for the sake of Ukrainians, against blackouts, against energy terror. What do we have for today? Ukraine withstood hundreds of Russian strikes of varying intensity at our energy sector. But now most of our power plants are unfortunately damaged or destroyed by shelling. All hydroelectric power plants, all thermal power plants... God forbid, but imagine what this would mean in your countries. One of the Russian strikes provoked the shutdown of all the nuclear units of our nuclear power plants, automation was activated - fortunately, without incident. At least one and a half billion euros are needed only for the superficial quick restoration of Ukrainian energy facilities destroyed by Russian strikes. Every time, after every Russian strike, we try to restore the technical ability to generate and supply electricity. Nevertheless, every day our energy workers have to disconnect millions of Ukrainians from the supply due to a critical shortage of electricity in the general energy system. Right now, about 12 million people in almost all regions and the capital are disconnected from the supply. Unfortunately, this is a typical situation for us. And we expect new Russian strikes every day, which can dramatically increase the number of shutdowns. That is why generators and uninterruptible power sources have now become as necessary in Ukraine as armored vehicles and bulletproof vests. This is the only way to protect ordinary people and the social order in the conditions of the Russian bid for blackout. In fact, a decentralized energy generation system parallel to the main one is currently being built in Ukraine. It is being built very quickly, in all regions, by many subjects. But still, it cannot meet all the needs of Ukraine. Yes, thousands of Ukrainian enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, social facilities continue to work thanks to generators. Yes, hospitals function on generators, hundreds of thousands of jobs have already been saved thanks to generators, the Internet and communications are insured against outages. More than 5,000 Points of Invincibility have been opened across the country - special facilities where people can warm up, charge equipment and use communications. And I am grateful to all our partners who are already helping Ukraine with the appropriate equipment to maintain such a level of energy sustainability of our state and society. But still, the key task is to preserve the main energy system of Ukraine, to guarantee its stable operation despite any Russian efforts to make Ukraine the darkest place in Europe. That is why such a format is needed. Here and now we have to agree on specific things that will not only help Ukraine endure the winter. They will also prove as clearly as possible to any anti-democratic and anti-European forces, and primarily to Russia, that Europe has learned to prevent catastrophe and protect its people. Ladies and Gentlemen! I will be as specific as possible now. First. We need several categories of equipment - these are transformers, equipment for restoring high-voltage networks, gas turbine and gas piston power units. Ukrainian representatives who are present at the Conference can inform you about all the technical characteristics of this request. Second. At least until the end of this heating season in Ukraine, we need emergency support from the European energy system. That is, the supply of electricity from the countries of the European Union to Ukraine. The volume is up to two gigawatts. For this to become possible, a decision of ENTSO-E to increase import capacity is necessary. Again, all the technical details of such a decision will be presented by our government officials who are present at the Conference. Such electricity supply support could cost around 800 million euros in current prices. This is significant. But significantly less than a blackout in Ukraine could cost us all. Therefore, I urge you to make one of the concrete results of this Conference the approval of all decisions for such support of Ukraine with the supply of electricity from EU countries. Third. By analogy with the observation missions of the IAEA, which have been agreed to be sent to all nuclear power plants of Ukraine, we call on the European Union to send special missions to the objects of critical energy infrastructure, which are involved in the energy supply of Ukraine and on which the stability of our entire region directly depends. Such EU missions could become a reliable factor in stabilizing the situation and proper international control. Fourth. Due to the destruction of power plants by terrorists, we are forced to use more gas this winter than expected. As a result, we need support in the purchase of about two billion cubic meters of gas. It is also a necessary element of our stability that needs your leadership. Fifth. Another practical result of this Conference could be an agreement on the financing of the project, which Emmanuel has already started talking about, on the purchase of LED lamps for Ukraine. This may not seem significant to someone. But 50 million such lamps will save about one gigawatt of electricity. Given that the average deficit in our power system is about two and a half gigawatts, this project could also help significantly. And sixth. We need a special permanent mechanism for coordinating efforts - the Paris Mechanism. This will make it possible to provide timely and effective responses to every challenge of Russian energy terror. Unfortunately, we do not yet have such a modern air defense system that can shoot down Russian missiles and drones one hundred percent, however we can create such a decision-making system that can one hundred percent make Russia&#x27;s terrorist tactics meaningless. When the energy stability of Ukraine is guaranteed for the entire winter period, when it is guaranteed that there will be no new waves of mass migration from our country to your countries, it will also be guaranteed that no strikes, no blackouts, no search for weapons somewhere out there in Iran or elsewhere will help Russia. Russia will have to think about how to stop aggression. Finally stop. Energy is one of the keys to this. I believe that this key will be in our hands, in your hands. Thank you for your attention! Once again, thank you, Mr. President, Emmanuel, for organizing this Conference. I count on very specific decisions. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The more effectively we combine the power of Ukraine and France, the more we will benefit from it, the more reliable peace will be - President&#x27;s address to the participants of the forum on the resilience and reconstruction of Ukraine in Paris</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-13</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much. Thank you to all the attendees. Thank you, Emmanuel, for all the words - the words of support - that you just said. The words of support for our society, Ukraine. Thank you very much for the news - it is important, pragmatic, yet very important and pleasant regarding the large contribution, regarding the support for Ukraine in the amount of 1 billion - it is really very important for us. And I want to say in general, Mr. President, I feel it and thank you once again for the fact that this day really became the day of Ukraine in France. This is extremely important - and not only for our country. I am sure that now we can feel how strong we all are together - Ukrainians, French, all Europeans. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear friends! We can feel it in the way we implement our values in overcoming the ruins brought by Russia. Any tyranny leaves ruins behind. On the contrary, European democracy must guarantee well-being and security - and this is exactly what we can show now. Show in Ukraine. That is why such an extended format of our work is important. Interstate cooperation at the level of presidents and governments - and cooperation at the level of local communities. The leading role of French business. Your non-governmental and professional associations. Today here, at our Forum and at the Conference that took place in the morning, at other events, the full power of French society is represented. And I believe that thanks to the timely investment of your strength in Ukraine, we will achieve equally beneficial results for both Ukraine and France, for ordinary Ukrainians, and for all your citizens. To list everything that was destroyed by Russia in Ukraine, all our needs for reconstruction and modernization, time set in regulations for this meeting of ours won’t be enough for sure. I will focus on several areas now. The first is the Chernihiv region of our country, the region over which France has already taken patronage. We’ve ousted the Russian army from there in the spring already. The hostilities in the Chernihiv region, as well as in other northern regions of Ukraine, lasted less than in the east or the south. But there is also significant destruction there. In general, 8,896 objects need to be restored in the Chernihiv region only in the framework of the Fast Recovery Plan - i.e. the objects that require immediate efforts. These are more than a thousand apartment buildings that were damaged or destroyed by shelling. More than 7 thousand private houses. And also hospitals, schools, communications, transport, enterprises. And this is only one region! Part of the work is already underway. In particular, France has already provided us with assistance in the restoration of bridges. But both for the French state and for French companies, there are much more opportunities and projects that need implementation. Today, Ukrainian government officials will present our needs for the fast recovery. And I invite you all to join! Join now - including in the framework of France&#x27;s patronage over the Chernihiv region. In total, hostilities directly affected the territory of eleven regions. The scope of our Fast Recovery Plan, which covers other regions as well, is more than fifty thousand objects and more than 12 billion euros. The second direction is charity. In her speech at the Conference in the morning, the First Lady of Ukraine presented a project to restore one of the hospitals of the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, the hub hospital in the city of Izyum. This is one of those projects for which Olena’s Foundation raises funds. Today, the Foundation will be presented in France, thank you for that. All areas of its work will be presented. These are education, healthcare and humanitarian aid. In each of these directions, people, public associations and companies of France can show themselves. And I ask you, Emmanuel, Mr. President, and I ask Mrs. Brigitte Macron to support this Foundation and, if possible, to be present there today. This is now an unconditional moral dominant in our society - everyone strives to do something that will strengthen us all - all of Ukraine. Someone can help the defense. Someone keeps jobs and even creates new ones - during the war. Someone joins the reconstruction. Thousands of people show volunteer initiative, participate in relevant projects. And also there is the social sphere - education, medicine, assistance to the elderly and assistance to displaced people... I invite all of you, friends, to choose your own direction! And the third is the economy. The already mentioned Chernihiv region and all other regions of our country need a new economic basis for life. Of course, all the details will be presented today by our government officials. But I will now draw your attention to something that you have undoubtedly already heard about. This year, due to the joint efforts of Ukraine and our partners, we managed to stop the spread of the global food crisis. We have restored seaborne agricultural exports from Ukraine, which have been blocked by the Russian fleet since the start of the full-scale war. Since August of this year, we have already exported more than 13 million tons of food. We also launched the globally important humanitarian initiative &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; - and I thank France and President Macron for supporting it. Thanks to this initiative of ours, we will help the poorest countries in the world with food. Such countries as Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan, and others. This is the salvation of millions of lives from famine and all the countries of the Mediterranean Basin from outbreaks of the migration crisis. But, friends, we send mainly agricultural raw materials both for export and as humanitarian cargo. And we can send processed products. It means that right now we need to develop an entire industry, which will be export-oriented, will definitely have consumers and will definitely be profitable. It is obvious that this is a profitable economic project. And it would be expedient for the French business to already assess the prospects and come to Ukraine for such a project. Likewise, we now have tremendous opportunities in energy, engineering, defense industry, transport, construction, IT and many other industries. Opportunities that you will not find anywhere else in the world now. Only in Ukraine can a large-scale project of ecological and modern re-industrialization be implemented quite quickly, and we have a clear understanding of how to do it. I know that today the representatives of our state will invite specific companies to cooperate and will outline the general prospects - what exactly we can offer to French business and what decisions we need at the level of the French state. Please join in! First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and representative of the Office of the President Rostyslav Shurma will present specific areas of possible cooperation. The sooner and more effectively we combine the power of Ukraine and France, the more we will benefit from it. And the more reliable peace will be, which, I am sure, we will be able to return to our country and all of Europe. I thank you for your attention! Thank you, Emmanuel. Please be proactive today in your communication with our government officials. Long live France! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The story of DACK is over, the story of reforms continues even during the war - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-13</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very fruitful day for Ukraine. In different aspects. We have very good news from France - two conferences in support of Ukraine were held there today. Their first result is €1 billion in aid to our resilience, primarily energy. Every day we gain new strength for Ukraine to get through this winter, and I thank everyone who works for this and who helps our state. Today, we also have decisions from other countries, besides France, - the Czech Republic, Spain, Switzerland - to provide additional support packages. The Italian Senate passed a decision on armed support. Norway is preparing a new program to support our state and people... I took part in both conferences in Paris today. The first concerned to a greater extent our interstate relations. The second forum was focused on French business. Ukrainian government officials presented French entrepreneurs with opportunities to invest in Ukraine already now, when the war is still going on, and after our victory. We also discussed what we can do additionally to strengthen our state at the European level. Today in France, the First Lady of Ukraine presents humanitarian projects to our partners. What can be done as quickly as possible to support our people in the field of healthcare, education and humanitarian aid, in particular through Olena’s Foundation. And I am grateful to all the French for their support of Ukraine - not only political, not only defense and sanctions, which is vitally important. But also for the fact that we equally perceive the need to protect the value of human life, human dignity and the humanitarian opportunities that the modern world gives to everyone. I spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel. I thanked for the decision regarding 18 billion euros for Ukraine next year and for increasing the European Peace Facility by 2 billion euros. These funds can greatly help us maintain social stability. I am also preparing to participate in the meeting of the European Council on December 15. I have just addressed the parliament and people of New Zealand, a country that has fundamentally supported us since the first weeks of full-scale Russian aggression. I’ve told about our peace formula, about the special summit that we are convening to implement our formula. And I called on New Zealand to take the lead in supporting at the international level one of the clauses of the peace formula - the one related to environmental security and demining. New Zealand is one of those countries that understands that the destruction of the natural environment is equal to the destruction of life, and that can help the diplomatic mobilization of its region in order to implement the Ukrainian peace formula. And one more thing. Today I signed the Law adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on the liquidation of the District Administrative Court of Kyiv. This story is over. And the story of reforms continues - continues even during such a war. Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is fighting for our independence, who is currently at the front, who is currently struggling! We support you, we strongly believe in you. Glory to all our warriors! Glory to our indomitable people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula and to start the consolidation of the world for the sake of countering ecocide - speech by the President in the Parliament of New Zealand</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-13</span></div>
  <p>Dear friends! Mrs. Prime Minister! Mr. Speaker! Mr. leader of the opposition! Government officials and parliamentarians! People of New Zealand! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and I would like to offer you leadership. Leadership in the protection of peace. This year has shown the world how much you can do when you have enough determination and know what to do. And let&#x27;s be honest - at the beginning of this year, no one in the world expected sensations from Ukraine. When the full-scale invasion of Russia began, I heard only sympathy in the voices of many interlocutors. But when they heard determination in response, everything changed instantly. Everyone whose heart resonated with the Ukrainian struggle for freedom joined the global coalition for the defense of freedom. Today, our anti-war coalition already includes more than a hundred states. Those who support the fundamental principles of international law and the UN Charter. Those who in international institutions - for example in the UN General Assembly - vote for decisions in favor of peace and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Those who provide our state with armed support and train our military. Those who imposed sanctions against the terrorist state and constantly raise the price for Russia for aggression and the global crises provoked by it. And those who help us solve these crises. Those who do everything to hold Russian war criminals to account for what they have committed against Ukraine. In 293 days of this terrible war, the very developments created opportunities for various countries and leaders to show themselves - to find their function in the protection of what all of us in the world value anyway. And I am grateful to you, dear friends, for the fact that New Zealand was one of the first to start supporting Ukraine in the struggle for independence and justice. Having felt the peculiarity of the moral challenge of this war, you changed your own approaches to sanctions policy and applied national sanctions against those involved in inciting aggression. You helped with finances for security needs, with the supply of ammunition and with the training of the military. You provided us with humanitarian support and you always help on international platforms. We in Ukraine appreciate all this very much. I thank you again for this support! But I would like to offer you something more. Various dictators and aggressors always do not realize that the strength of the free world is not that someone is big and accumulated missiles, but that everyone knows how to unite and act decisively, sincerely, and that everyone makes their unique contribution to the common cause. Maybe it is time for your country to make just such a unique contribution. I am talking now about one of the points of our Peace Formula, which I proposed recently at the G19 summit held in Indonesia. So, you have probably heard about 10 points that can restore peace to Ukraine and all of Europe, and restore security and stability to the world, which were shattered by Russian strikes. These are very transparent and logical points. This is radiation and nuclear security. Food security. Energy security. Release of all prisoners of war and return of deportees. Full implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of territorial integrity of Ukraine. Withdrawal of Russian troops from our land and, thanks to this, cessation of hostilities. Restoring justice through the prosecution of war criminals. Countering ecocide. Preventing the escalation of the war and fixing its end. Each of these points is capable of removing one or another element of Russian aggression. And therefore, they all guarantee peace. And I suggested convening a special summit in the coming months. Global Peace Formula Summit, at which the partner states could decide which of the points of the Peace Formula they could help implement. Similar to how we implement the second point of the Formula - food security. There is a format of cooperation with the UN, with Türkiye, with other partners, and as a result, there are two initiatives that remove from the global food market the deficit that arose due to the criminal Russian blockade of our seaports. We unblocked three Ukrainian seaports. The results of this are obvious. Our grain export initiative and Grain From Ukraine humanitarian initiative are now working together to solve the problem of global famine. By the way, please inquire about them. Perhaps you will see your role in mitigating the food crisis as well. But still, first of all, I urge you to pay attention to the eighth point of our Peace Formula. The point on environmental security. Educated people understand well what war means for the natural environment. Your society is just that - educated. The destroyed economy and infrastructure can be rebuilt. It takes years. But you cannot rebuild destroyed nature. Just as you cannot restore destroyed life. As of now, 174,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory are contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance. The water area of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is also contaminated with mines and has lost hundreds of thousands of living creatures who died as a result of hostilities and the activity of the Russian navy. Dozens of rivers are polluted. Hundreds of coal mines are flooded. Dozens of the most hazardous enterprises, including chemical ones, were destroyed by Russian strikes. Three million hectares of forests in Ukraine are affected by hostilities. All this and other manifestations of the Russian ecocidal policy will have direct negative repercussions for millions of people, for our region and neighboring regions. I am sure that your society feels the fragility of our world. Feels how important it is for all people on the planet to conduct a rational policy in relation to our common home. By the way, just as in relation to our common values, on which the peaceful coexistence of nations is based. And that is why I suggest that your country, your leaders consider taking into account this environmental point of our Peace Formula. I urge you to show leadership in international institutions, in particular in the UN, and on a bilateral level with other states, so that the world can see this challenge of the Russian war. So that the world sees that there is no real peace where any child can die from a hidden Russian anti-personnel mine. There is no real peace where the consequences of war in the form of poisoned groundwater can destroy normal life in several countries. There is no real peace where ecocide has taken place, and its consequences have not been overcome. Perhaps now it seems that there will be no great sensations from such a topic. But until today, the world does not have a common experience of overcoming the destructive impact of war on the natural environment. We will liberate our land. We will win this war - I am sure of it. We will return freedom and security to all Ukrainians, no matter where they live. The countries of the world are already taking the lead in implementing such points of our Peace Formula, such as, for example, the point on justice. Yesterday, the Netherlands announced its readiness to host a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. And I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula in your parliament and start the consolidation of the world for the sake of the eighth point of the Formula - for the sake of countering ecocide. Let Russia be held to account for all manifestations of its aggression. I thank you for your attention! Nga mihi! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The most effective protection of freedom, human rights and the rule of law is to hold to account all those who started the war - President of Ukraine at the presentation of the Sakharov Prize</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-14</span></div>
  <p>Thank you Roberta! Dear Mrs. President, dear Roberta! Dear friends! Greetings to you on behalf of all our people, it is a great honor for me. Greetings from all those who fight, who work for the sake of Ukraine and for the sake of freedom. For the sake of everything without which it is impossible to imagine all of us, life, Europe. Impossible to imagine without Ukraine and without freedom. And not only because it will simply be untrue. But also because any attempt to deprive Europe of Ukraine and freedom is always a crime. And we see such a crime now - Russia&#x27;s terrorist war against Ukraine and Europe. This was also the case in the past, when tyrannies tried to subjugate Ukrainians and deprive all Europeans of their freedom. But when we win now - Ukrainians and all Europeans - we will win in such a way that there will never again be attempts to deprive Europe of Ukraine and freedom. We will win in such a way that there will be no attempt to apply genocidal policy against our people again, both in Ukraine and throughout Europe. We have to give - and we will! – a new effective security architecture for global freedom and international legal order. I consider this part of our common moral obligation. Look at the offensive of the Russian army. The occupiers are burning everything in front of them - with artillery and missiles, bombs and drones, mines, ordnance that did not explode and remains in our land. The occupiers are destroying cities and villages and all vital infrastructure... This was the case in Mariupol - you all saw it. This was the case in Volnovakha, another city that was completely destroyed after the Russian offensive. More than 20 thousand people lived there before this war. Now there are total ruins. The Russian army is doing the same with Bakhmut, another city of Donbas, which Russian strikes turn into broken stones. More than 70,000 people used to live there... Just recently. Last year. Now there are ruins. Perhaps only after the end of this war, when we liberate all our land and can discover all the graves of the victims of Russian terror, will we be able to say how many lives tyranny took this time. Now we know thousands of names of the dead. Unfortunately, there may be many more of them. I ask all of you to honor with a moment of silence the memory of all Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women, all adults and children, all soldiers, all civilians, whose lives were taken by this disgraceful war! Thank you very much! Dear friends! It is necessary to act now - without waiting for the end of the war - to hold to account all those who started it, and to prevent any repetition of aggression. This will be the most effective protection of freedom, human rights, the rule of law and other common values of ours, which are embodied, in particular, by this award of the European Parliament - the Sakharov Prize. I am grateful to everyone who investigates and helps investigate the crimes of the occupiers in Ukraine, who is looking for information about Russian murderers and terrorists. I am grateful to the International Criminal Court, which closely cooperates with Ukrainian prosecutors and has a clear intention to ensure justice for what the occupiers committed on the territory of our country. And I am grateful to all the leaders and states, all the politicians and international organizations who are working together with us and are making every possible effort to create a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. I call on all of you, your parties and states to effectively support this work! The tribunal must start working. The European Parliament has already supported this idea. It is necessary to turn it into reality as soon as possible. In particular, through the adoption of a separate resolution of the European Parliament in support of the creation of the Tribunal, through your support and the support of your countries for the corresponding resolution of the UN General Assembly. The cities and villages destroyed by Russia, destroyed destinies, broken and executed lives should be reflected in the sentences not only for those who directly committed all this, but also in the sentences for those who organized and started this aggression. And when the principle of the inevitability of punishment works for the crime of aggression against Ukraine, we will be able to make the corresponding institutional basis of justice permanently effective. When any potential aggressor knows that punishment for criminal war is inevitable, it will be the most effective tool for war prevention. And one more thing. Historical responsibility. Evil always has a motive to return when the history of evil is not fully written. Dear deputies! I know that tomorrow you will consider the issue of recognizing the Holodomor crime against the Ukrainian people as genocide. And I urge you to support such a recognition with the maximum majority of votes for the sake of justice. Europe should give the strongest possible signal that there will not be a single gap left in the history of tragedies on our continent, in the history of crimes against humanity and humanness committed on our land. I believe that it will be so! Thank you for your support! Thank you for celebrating our struggle - for this award! I thank you personally, Roberta, for supporting us - you came to Kyiv in a difficult, dangerous time, for supporting our reforms, our movement into European structures, and for really helping. Thank you! Glory to all our warriors! Glory to everyone who defends freedom and our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are preparing agreements that will strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s defense capabilities - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-14</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, I want to thank our anti-aircraft gunners and the Air Force for repelling another attack by Iranian drones this morning. The skies of the Kyiv region are defended by the 96th anti-aircraft missile brigade of the Air Force. Thank you guys! A total of 13 Shaheds were shot down. These are 13 saved infrastructure objects, these are saved lives. In one morning. I held a meeting of the Staff today. We talked, in particular, about the protection of the sky. We are constantly strengthening our air defense and anti-drone defense. And we are doing everything to get more modern and more powerful systems for Ukraine. This week we have made important progress on the air defense issue. Of course, the situation in Donbas and other active areas on the frontline was discussed in great detail at the Staff meeting. There is no calm on the frontline. There is nothing easy and simple. Every day and every meter is given extremely hard. Especially where the entire tactic of the occupiers boils down to the destruction of everything in front of them with artillery, so that only bare ruins and craters in the ground remain. Today, by the way, I spoke about it in an address to the European Parliament. Russia is destroying city after city in Donbas, like Mariupol, like Volnovakha, like Bakhmut. Defense in such conditions is not just heroism, it is something more. And I thank all our warriors who withstand the pressure of the occupiers. I would like to note the warriors of the 46th separate airmobile brigade, who very skillfully and bravely defeated the enemy during another attack and forced him to retreat. Well done! I would also like to note the warriors of the 80th and 95th separate airborne assault brigades who are fighting in the Kreminna direction - and very effectively. Thank you, warriors! We are preparing agreements that will strengthen our defense capabilities and give Ukraine more operational capabilities. We also do not slow down our activity for the sake of creating a special tribunal for Russian aggression and holding all those responsible for it to account. Today I called on our friends in Europe and members of the European Parliament to step up their efforts to make the tribunal finally operational. The terrorist state must bear responsibility for every burned Ukrainian city, for every destroyed life of our people. And it will bear it. I spoke today with International Olympic Committee President Bach. In particular, about the fact that the principles of the Olympic movement definitely do not envisage conniving with terrorist states. Any ideas on how to get Russian representatives back to international competitions are ideas on how to allow those guilty of terror to tell their society that the world supposedly condones terror. This is a sports indulgence. This is how it will be presented by Russian propaganda if the International Olympic Committee fails and allows those who represent war and nothing else to participate in sporting events on an equal footing with others. I do not want to clarify whether there are any motives behind such ideas about the return of Russia. But no one will turn a blind eye to any attempt to reduce international pressure on the source of the war. When we receive reports like today from Kherson, where a child, a boy, was killed by yet another Russian shelling... He was eight years old... We can only say one thing: a white or any neutral flag is impossible for Russian athletes, all their flags are bloodstained. Today, I held very important negotiations with UN Secretary-General Guterres. I thanked him for his constant support of Ukraine and international law, for effective assistance in the implementation of our initiatives, such as &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot;. We are currently working on organizing missions with an international mandate to the objects of the critical energy infrastructure of our state. I believe that this can also be successful. And one more thing. Today, 64 Ukrainians were returned from Russian captivity. 64 warriors. Four officers and 60 privates and sergeants. Among them are seriously wounded. We provide adequate assistance to everyone. We continue to work to free and return home every Ukrainian man and woman still held captive in Russia. I would like to thank our team that ensures the exchanges. I thank everyone who works for Ukrainians and Ukraine! Glory to all who fight for our country! Glory to all who fill with their courage and effectiveness the word that is now heard all over the world - the word “Ukraine”. And I want to separately thank &quot;Plast&quot; today, our Ukrainian scouts, guides for the Peace Light of Bethlehem, which they brought to Ukraine. Let this light support all of us, all Ukrainians. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Macro-financial support for Ukraine and strengthening EU sanctions against Russia are also weapons in the defense of freedom - President&#x27;s speech at the meeting of the European Council</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-15</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much, Charles! Thank you very much, Mr. President! Dear colleagues! I am glad to greet you all. Next week, December 23, it will be six months since Ukraine obtained the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. And we wasted no time - Ukraine and all of Europe became stronger in six months. We maintain unity - and that is why we find effective answers to any anti-European challenges. We continue to defend our common values together, and therefore together we achieve tangible victories. In six months, we returned the territory of the Kharkiv region to Ukraine and all of Europe, returned the city of Kherson and part of the Kherson region, which were occupied by Russia at the beginning of the invasion. This liberation showed the world that our common defense is not something accidental, but an inalienable and unstoppable force of ours. And I thank you for the large-scale and multifaceted assistance to Ukraine, which allows us to return freedom to our people, our cities, our villages. Nothing else proves the strength of Europe more clearly than the tears of gratitude in the eyes of the people we are liberating from the Russian occupation - in particular, thanks to your support. I thank you very much! During these six months, we started the construction of an air shield for Ukraine, and therefore - the creation of one of the key security guarantees for the whole of Europe. When we have a sufficiently powerful and modern air defense and missile defense system, we will be able to dismantle the basis of Russian terror, namely, we will destroy Russia&#x27;s ability to destroy others. I am grateful to all our partners who help us with air defense and missile defense, guaranteeing the security of the entire eastern flank of Europe. In six months, we not only preserved the full spectrum of political initiative, but also found a solution to overcome the unprecedented crises provoked by Russia. In particular, we have taken globally useful steps to stop the food crisis and prevent a new migrant crisis, which could hit at least the entire south of our continent. I am grateful to everyone who supported our grain export initiative, who has already joined our humanitarian initiative &quot;Grain From Ukraine&quot; and who helps create new logistics and export-import opportunities in all parts of Europe, which strengthen all of us. And right now we see what internal strength Europe has to guarantee energy security and protect itself from the social outbreaks that our common enemy so hoped for. Europe prepared for winter in conditions where Russia artificially created an absolutely insane deficit on the gas market. Now we see that this madness has hit not Europe, but the gas industry of Russia itself. I am grateful to all of you who are helping Ukraine overcome the most cynical form of terror that has ever been on our continent - energy terror. The Russian bet on the destruction of our energy infrastructure, our energy industry, and therefore on a humanitarian catastrophe for tens of millions of Ukrainians and all our neighboring countries in the EU remains. Therefore, we still need your support for energy, and therefore social resilience. Dear colleagues! Europe! The next six months will be decisive in many respects in the confrontation that Russia started with this aggression. Aggression against Ukraine and against each of you, because the ultimate target of Russia is much further than our border and Ukrainian sovereignty. The next six months will demand even greater efforts from us than this past time. First, Russia&#x27;s energy terror must be defeated in all its forms. Any Russian energy blackmail, any destructive actions by Russia against critical infrastructure in Ukraine or, for example, against underwater cables and gas pipelines in Europe, any attempts to destabilize the gas and oil markets or nuclear energy sector must receive strong responses from all of Europe. From this point of view, the idea of price caps for Russian energy exports is extremely useful. The stronger such an instrument will be, the lower the price caps, the more stable the global energy market will be. And we urge you to agree on effective price caps for oil, oil products, and gas from Russia. These price caps should definitely deprive the terrorist state of the ability to finance the war at the expense of the global market. And the ultimate goal of the entire energy strategy of Europe should be the complete independence of our continent from dirty Russian energy resources. I assure you that, from this perspective, Ukraine will be able to become a new reliable major supplier of green energy resources for the whole of Europe. The second is the winter resilience of Ukraine. Russia wants to break your security by destroying our infrastructure. Any blackouts in Ukraine are strikes at your social systems due to new waves of migration. Any attempts by Russia to show that Ukraine does not have sufficient resilience are attempts to show you, the world, that Europe does not have sufficient resilience. Therefore I urge you to continue doing everything so that we can maintain the energy supply for Ukrainians. And I am grateful to each and every one of you who are already helping with the supply of equipment and financial support. But now, in order for the next six months to pass without upheavals, something more needs to be done. In particular, we need support in the purchase of the volume of gas that is used to compensate for the damage caused by Russian strikes at other types of generation. It is about two billion cubic meters of gas. We also need support with electricity for Ukraine - with supply from the EU. Just as we can help you by exporting electricity when we get our generation back up, we need your help now to get us through this winter. It is about the supply of electricity worth about eight hundred million euros. The third aspect is defensive support. It should be no less than in the past six months. This is critically important for the protection of Ukrainian freedom and the very idea of Europe in the global confrontation with Russia. But apart from this, we need more modern weapons, more supply. This applies to both air defense and missile defense. And I ask each of the twenty-seven countries of the European Union to decide what specifically you can do to increase the supply of air defense and missile defense systems. This also applies to modern tanks. There is no rational reason why Ukraine should not receive them now. I am asking you to show leadership - the first one to provide modern tanks will open this supply possibility to the whole world and will be remembered as one of the most important defenders of freedom in our time. This also applies to longer-range artillery and missile systems that could speed up the end of Russian aggression. All this is a direct saving of millions of lives. The fourth is diplomacy. Over the past six months, we have developed and offered to the world a Peace Formula that contains everything necessary not only to end this war, but also to guarantee, reliably and permanently, that there will be no repetition of the same or the beginning of any other war in Europe. I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula! You all know its elements - they are logical, effective, and can be implemented already in the next six months. For this purpose, in the near future we are organizing a summit - Global Peace Formula Summit. I hope to see all of you and your leadership in helping peace at this summit. Pay attention - each of the points of our Peace Formula allows each conscientious country to show its leadership and help with this or that specific goal. In fact, it is like a menu - for manifestations of leadership. And these are really opportunities for all countries to contribute to the security of Ukraine, the whole of Europe, and the world. These are opportunities both for those who are more active in international relations and for those who, so far, do less to protect peace. And the fifth - for the next six months. A task based on values. I want to thank all of you once again for supporting Ukraine in obtaining the candidate status. Now is the time to take another step. Despite the war, we do not stop the institutional transformation of our state. This week alone, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved three European integration laws: the law on national communities, the law on modernization of the principles of work of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and on the media sphere. And this is just one illustration of the many things we have done in order to prepare the next stage of rapprochement between Ukraine and the EU. Namely, the assessment of the implementation of the recommendations of the European Commission, which we expect from you in the near future. And we strongly ask you to do this, and to speed up this process, so that we can proceed to the start of negotiations regarding Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the EU. I believe that everything emphasized by me today will be implemented. Because for Ukraine and for Europe, when we are together, nothing is impossible. We will defeat any terror, we will implement any of our joint tasks. I thank you for your attention! And I thank you for the support! I would like to express special gratitude for your steps on sanctions over the past six months, for the package of financial support for our country in the amount of 18 billion euros for the next year, which can be finally approved at the leadership level right now. This is vital. And Charles, my friend, I am asking you very much to ensure that our struggle for peace for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe does not depend on misunderstandings and controversies between some EU member states. The packages of macro-financial support for Ukraine are also weapons in defense of freedom. Just as the ninth package of EU sanctions against Russia. This is our protection. Please understand that! I hope that already in January we will be able to thank you for the first tranche of this macro-financial package. Thanks again for your attention! Long live Europe! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The invaders cannot defeat our army, so they destroy every city and village; the only way to stop it is to push them out of our land - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-15</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Briefly about today. First. There is a confirmation of the macro-financial aid from the European Union for Ukraine for the next year. The volume is 18 billion euros. This is a good result. Second. I spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau. It was a good conversation - we are preparing to strengthen our defense cooperation. I am grateful to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and all Canadians for the principled leadership on sanctions policy. Every sanction step against Russia for the war that has already been taken by the free world really helps us bring peace closer. Third. We are preparing important international events for the next week. Something that could give Ukraine more defense support this winter, more military capabilities. During another Russian shelling of Kherson today, a projectile hit the aid station of the Red Cross. The woman who died was a paramedic, a volunteer. My condolences to the relatives... Just since the beginning of this day, Russia has shelled Kherson more than 16 times! Only in one day! And it is so every day. Today, communities of the Kharkiv region were shelled again... Today in Donbas, as in all previous weeks, brutal Russian attacks continue. The occupiers throw everyone and everything they have into the offensive. They cannot defeat our army, so they physically destroy every town and village so that there are no buildings, not even walls, that can be used for any kind of defense... The only way to stop this is to push out Russian terrorists step by step from our Ukrainian land. To continue the pressure on Russia. To find new ways to hold every Russian terrorist, every Russian oligarch who helps the terrorist state and all Russian officials and propagandists to account for everything they do. Do against Ukraine, against freedom as such. Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who holds the front in Donbas, in the south, who holds the border, who protects our sky and our people. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia still has enough missiles for several massive strikes, we have enough determination and self-belief to return ours – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-16</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! First of all, I thank our Air Force fighters, our counter aircraft fighters, intelligence and everyone who protects and helps protect the Ukrainian sky. Today&#x27;s result is 60 shot down missiles. All air commands – Center, South, East and West were active. And the fighters of the 96th anti-aircraft missile brigade, which protect Kyiv region, were especially effective. Over 40 terrorists&#x27; missiles were destroyed in the sky of the central regions of the country and near Kyiv. I thank you, warriors! But, unfortunately, there is a hit. Terrorists need such a large number of missiles in an attack that at least part of their &quot;products&quot; reaches their intended targets. All their targets today are civilian, and these are mainly energy and heat supply facilities. Probably, as a result of this war, the meaning of the word &quot;terror&quot; for most people in the world will be associated primarily with such crazy actions of Russia. In Kryvy Rih, the demolition of the rubble of a residential building, which was hit by one of the Russian missiles, continued all day. The list of the dead so far includes three. My condolences to all the relatives... More than ten people were injured, including children. Everyone gets help. Emergency power outages were applied today across the country – in most cities and regions. In Kyiv and 14 regions, as a result of power outages, water supply halted. Our power engineers and repair crews have already started working during the air alert and are doing everything possible to restore generation and supply. It takes time. But it will be. I ask all our people to be patient now and I thank everyone whose job is to restore normality at any time and under any circumstances. I also ask the representatives of regional and local authorities to be more active in creating an additional reserve of energy strength. Please work more actively with business so that more companies join the Points of Invincibility map. And I ask everyone now – of course, if possible – to take care of those who have the most difficulties... The elderly, families with children, displaced people from war zones or from the occupied territory. If you can help, please help. No matter what the missile worshipers from Moscow are hoping for, it still won&#x27;t change the balance of power in this war. They still have enough missiles for several such heavy strikes. We have enough determination and self-belief to return our own after these blows. And one more. The European Union approved the ninth package of sanctions against Russia during the war. Ninth, but obviously not the last. Because it is obvious that the pressure needs to be increased. I thank all those leaders and countries who fought for a stronger package. But we will work with the European Commission, with the leaders of the EU countries, with the European public, so that the existing sanctions policy works towards the end of the war and does not give Russia wrong signals – signals that someone is ready to ease the pressure. I thank everyone who keeps to principles! Glory to all who work for our victory! Glory to all our soldiers, who heroically repel all attempts of Russian mercenaries to gain a foothold in Bakhmut! 17th separate tank brigade, 46th separate airmobile brigade – glory to you guys! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Air Force – Thanks again! And the last. I will repeat constantly. Dear our partners, find an opportunity to provide us with a reliable air defense shield. This is saving people&#x27;s lives. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Reliable air defense shield will make Russian missile terror impossible, this will mean security for millions of people – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health! The main thing today is energy. During the day, it was possible to restore the electricity supply to almost 6 million Ukrainians. Repair work is ongoing now and has been going on non-stop since yesterday&#x27;s terrorist attack. Of course, there is still a lot of work to do to stabilize the system. Problems with the supply of heat, big problems with the supply of water exist. The most difficult situation is in the city of Kyiv and the region, Vinnytsia and the region, Lviv and the region. But there are, unfortunately, large-scale outages in many other regions: they include Dnipro and Dnipropetrovsk region, Volyn, Zhytomyr region, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk region, the city of Odesa and the region, Poltava region, Ternopil region, Chernihiv region and other cities and regions. Russia spares no resources for the war against our people – precisely against the people, against all Ukrainians from Lutsk to Kharkiv, from Sumy to Odesa. And I am grateful to every leader, I am grateful to every nation – our partners who understand that Russia&#x27;s large-scale &quot;investment&quot; in terror is already, imagine, more than 4,000 missiles! It&#x27;s necessary to exceed it with even more help to the people against whom this terror is directed. This week we received important decisions from the EU, partner countries in Europe, the United States, which will help maintain stability now and in the coming year. This applies to defense support, energy support, and macro-financial assistance for Ukraine. But there is still work to be done. There are still vital decisions awaiting final approval and implementation. In particular, I will constantly remind... Dear partners! Find an opportunity to give Ukraine reliable protection of the sky, a reliable air defense shield. You can do it. You can give protection to our people – one hundred percent protection from these terrorist Russian strikes. When this happens, the main form of Russian terror – missile terror – will become simply impossible. And this will mean safety for Ukrainians, safety for millions of people and a strategic realignment of the entire military situation. The fewer opportunities Russia has for terror, the more opportunities we will have to restore and guarantee peace. We are already preparing for the international events that are planned for the near future – both political and more global, which include not only traditional political audiences, but also all people of the world who value peace and are ready to support our defense against Russian terror. You will see everything. Also on Monday, a meeting of the leaders of the Northern European countries will take place: the UK, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Iceland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway. These are our extremely important friends, important partners and effective helpers in our defense. So we are preparing several new proposals from Ukraine, how to strengthen us all, all the countries of Europe. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! Thank you to all our energy workers, everyone who works to supply heat and water, everyone who repairs communications damaged by shelling and restores, and restores, and restores normal life every time, no matter how the terrorists try to leave us in the cold and in the dark. The terrorists will still lose. Glory to all those who hold back hell in Bakhmut and other areas in Donetsk region! Glory to all who hold our front! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This winter, we are preparing a special summit for the sake of peace and invite our partners to show their leadership - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-18</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff today. The situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions was examined in great detail. The Bakhmut direction is key. We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there. The Zaporizhzhia region, the Kherson region, the south in general - we are gradually reducing the potential of the occupiers. Minus ammunition dumps, minus logistics of the Russian army. Air defense is a constant priority of the Staff, and I emphasize this once again... Dear partners! By helping us fully protect our skies, by providing us with more modern air defense systems in sufficient numbers, you can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror. This will be one of the most powerful steps that will bring the end of aggression closer. Russia will have to follow the path of cessation of aggression, when it can no longer follow the path of missile strikes. The border was also discussed in detail at the Staff. Protection of the border with both Russia and Belarus is also a constant priority. We are preparing for all possible defense scenarios. Whoever inclines Minsk to whatever, it will not help them just as any other sick idea in this war against Ukraine and Ukrainians. There are new results in returning light and heat to our people. Another 3 million Ukrainians have had their energy supply restored. Plus 6 million yesterday. That is, after the terrorist attack on Friday, there is already a result for 9 million of our people. In most cities, the work of transport is being normalized. I thank everyone who carries out these repair works in any weather and around the clock! I thank each of our partners who help us with equipment! I also thank Ukrainian business - everyone who transforms their shops, cafes, enterprises into new Points of Invincibility. Today, the FIFA World Cup final took place in Qatar - an emotional final. This is the meaning of football: everyone has a chance to win, everyone can show that he is the strongest. But the competition is on the playing field, not on the battlefield. And the worst thing that can happen is a red card, not a red button. When people are united by football, people are united by peace. That is why I have prepared a special address from Ukraine to the whole world for today. To all who value peace and life. Although FIFA blocked this address from being shown at the stadium before the final game in Qatar, the world still heard our call. Our football players shared the video... Yarmolenko and the entire national team of Ukraine, Shevchenko, Shovkovskyi, Modrić, Srna, Guardiola, Raț and many, many other wonderful players. I thank everyone! Partner states supported it. Thousands of world media spread it. We are already preparing a special summit this winter. A summit for peace. For our country and for any other nation that can be subjected to the same aggression, the same terror as Russia has brought to our land. The Ukrainian Peace Formula consists of ten clear points capable of creating a new, globally important security architecture, which will restore freedom to our entire Ukrainian land, to all our people. And which will serve as guarantees of freedom and security for other nations. Not if, but when it works for Ukrainians. And that is why we invite our partners to show their leadership in guaranteeing peace in the same way that the leadership of various countries and various statesmen is currently being shown in the defense of freedom. We fight together for Ukraine, for the values that unite Europe and the democratic world, for the global value of life. For everything that Russia is trying to destroy. It is not easy, it is difficult, but I am sure: we will pull through together, and Russia&#x27;s aggression will fail. And in a way so that all other potential aggressors of the world do not dare to repeat what russism does. Glory to each of our warriors! Gratitude to everyone who works for the victory and who helps! We will pull through everything, we will overcome everything. And one more thing. Congratulations to the Jewish community of Ukraine and all the Jews of the world on Hanukkah. Those who were outnumbered defeated those who outnumbered them. Light defeated darkness. It will be the same this time. Chag Hanukkah Sameach! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russian aggression can and must fail; our task is to speed it up - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the meeting of the leaders of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF)</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-19</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much, Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister Sunak! Mr. Prime Minister Kariņš, everyone present! I am grateful, first of all, for these words of support. They are very important, and they are about the priorities you’ve mentioned. Dear friends, dear leaders! First of all, I want to thank you all for supporting Ukraine and our struggle for freedom. When I participated in this format of ours last time, and it was on the twentieth day of a full-scale invasion, I called on you: help Ukraine and through it - help yourself. This is exactly how we have been acting all these months. And I thank you all for that, for your great support! That is why we see the most important thing - that Russian aggression can and must fail. And our task now is to speed it up. Now - at this summit - I urge you to do everything to speed up the defeat of the occupiers. I will be very specific today - absolutely practical. Perhaps you expect a more political speech. But it is a different time now. It is time for specific things. Ukraine was again attacked by Iranian drones this night. 34 &quot;Shaheds&quot;. I say both the number and the name, and quite specifically. These are &quot;Shaheds&quot; from the new batch that Russia received from Iran. 250 items - that&#x27;s how many &quot;Shaheds&quot; have now been received by the terrorist state. Russian missiles and Iranian drones are constantly used to strike primarily at our energy sector - and you know all the details about it. Only one recent massive attack on Ukraine affected more than 20 million of our people. As a result, cities with millions of inhabitants and most Ukrainian regions were left completely without electricity. In general, on the evening of December 16, 22 million 408 thousand Ukrainians were disconnected from the energy supply. More than 10 million people had their water and heat supplies cut off. Imagine the scale of this terror. And imagine that it can be stopped. Dear leaders! Right now to a large extent it depends on you when and how this war will end. And everything is very specific. The more successful our Defense Forces are, the sooner Russian aggression will fail. Winter is now a really crucial time. It is a time when decisions can be made, the results of which in the spring will allow us to outline the restoration of our territorial integrity and guarantee that Russian revanchism will never again cross the border of Ukraine, and therefore - the border of Europe. And I want to address everyone. Mr. Prime Minister of Britain! Rishi! When we can fully protect the Ukrainian sky, it will mean the dismantling of the last great Russian opportunity to terrorize Ukraine. And therefore, it will also be the dismantling of the last great Russian hope that they will allegedly succeed in conquering our state and people. And I am asking you to increase the possibility of supplying air defense systems to our state and help speed up the relevant decisions of partners. One hundred percent air shield for Ukraine will be one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression. And this step is needed right now. Mr. Prime Minister of Norway! Mr. Støre! I am asking you to continue your policy of defense support for Ukraine in the next year as well - at least at the same level as this year. And we already see tangible results. NASAMS which have already been given to us, significantly strengthened our defense. I thank you for this! I am asking you to increase the supply of such systems and missiles for them. Mrs. Minister of Defense of the Netherlands! Mrs. Ollongren! For our defense operations to be more successful, we need modern armored vehicles. First of all, tanks. There is no explanation why Ukraine has not yet obtained a decision on the provision of modern and effective tanks - in particular, &quot;Leopards&quot;. This is vital! I am asking you and your partners to reach this decision, to help us. The first to open this defense opportunity for Ukraine - with the supply of tanks - will open it for all other partners of ours. The first step is needed to get others to take their steps as well. I am asking to continue our cooperation regarding Soviet-type tanks - the necessary shells, as well as Harpoon complexes and other artillery systems. Mr. Prime Minister of Sweden! Mr. Kristersson! We have already discussed with you the possibilities of strengthening our artillery. This is what determines the developments on the battlefield, namely the artillery. You know how large a stockpile of artillery systems and shells there is in Russia. And this artillery arrogance of the terrorist state must be shut down. We need to increase our capabilities on the battlefield so that the Russian leadership quicklier understands that this aggression has no chance. You have good Archer systems - I urge you to make a decision on them. And also you can strengthen the capabilities in the defense of the sky, and if you can - these are RBS-98 anti-aircraft missile systems and these are Gripen aircraft. We have to achieve such a historically important result for us. Mr. President of Lithuania! Gіtanas, my friend! I thank you for the fact that Lithuania became one of the first countries to help us. Even before the start of the full-scale invasion, when we have already been preparing for defense, you helped us. I thank you for that! And I am asking you to continue our cooperation next year. We need both NASAMS, as you know, and &quot;Stingers&quot;, which we can get if your decision is made. Dear Mr. Prime Minister of Latvia! Mr. Kariņš! I thank you for your constant and principled support throughout the Russian war. And let&#x27;s reduce the time of this aggression even more actively! You can help us with artillery systems - please make such decisions. Dear Mrs. Prime Minister of Estonia! Mrs. Kallas! You also have this opportunity - 155-mm artillery shells, spare parts for howitzers. Let&#x27;s intensify our cooperation. Dear Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense of Denmark! Mr. Ellemann-Jensen! You are aware of our need for CAESAR systems, which have proven themselves well on the battlefield, and these are the systems you expect from France. But they are vitally necessary for us right now, precisely in Ukraine. We need your decision on CAESAR. And I am asking you to continue our cooperation next year, which has already been achieved in the field of defense, in particular in anti-ship defense. Dear Mr. President of Finland! Mr. Niinistö! I thank you for the armored vehicles provided to us - the APCs that you provided help us a lot. You have 122-mm and 152-mm caliber - they are vitally necessary. Means of radio-electronic warfare, countering drones. MLRS complexes. Please maintain the level of interaction that has already been achieved between us. The sooner we restore our border, the stronger your security will be. I am sure of it. Dear Mrs. Prime Minister! Mrs. Jakobsdóttir! I thank you for your demining initiatives and humanitarian leadership. I am asking you to expand our cooperation next year, to create even more opportunities to protect our people from Russian mine terror. Dear friends! Today - on St. Nicholas Day according to the Eastern Rite - Russian terrorists &quot;gifted&quot; new strikes to Ukrainian children. I am asking you to support our country right now with a clear decision - to provide everything that can not only preserve the existing dynamics on the battlefield in Ukraine, but also accelerate the movement of our Defense Forces to victory. Because our victory will be the victory of each of you, it is the victory of Europe, your nations, the victory, which the whole world expects, I am sure of that. That’s that - Ukrainian children in their letters to St. Nicholas ask for air defense, weapons and victory - victory for themselves, victory for all Ukrainians. Our children understand everything. Let&#x27;s act! I thank you for your attention! I thank you all for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The key task for all of us now is to increase international support for Ukraine next year - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-19</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today&#x27;s morning in several regions and cities of our country was, unfortunately, spoiled by the characteristic sound of the Iranian Shaheds. But most of them luckily fell short of their intended targets, and that made our morning a little better today. 30 Shaheds were shot down - not bad I thank all our anti-aircraft fighters, pilots, and mobile fire groups for this result and for the protection of the Ukrainian sky. And I am especially grateful to the 96th Kyiv and 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, which showed the greatest accuracy today. These Shaheds, which were used by Russia, are from a new batch of drones. This is the terrorist international of two regimes - they help fight against people. Well, both of them will be held to account for it. This week will be quite active for us in terms of international events and negotiations. I held several meetings today regarding these plans. We will fight to strengthen sanctions for all manifestations of terror against Ukrainians and to get additional support for our state and our defense forces. Today I addressed the leaders of the ten states of Northern Europe united in The Joint Expeditionary Force. This is a format of cooperation initiated by Great Britain. It includes the Baltic states, Finland, Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Iceland and the United Kingdom itself. And my appeal today was very specific. Weapons, ammunition, new defense capabilities... Everything that will allow us to speed up the end of this war. Thank you to the participants of the summit for the fact that we were heard today - we are waiting for new decisions regarding the supply of new weapons. The key task for all of us now – my task, and that of each of our diplomats and officials – is that world support for Ukraine next year not just remains at the same level as this year, but increases. Precisely under those indicators that are necessary to strengthen our defense operations. This is artillery - we need more guns, shells, these are modern tanks that have not yet been delivered to Ukraine, these are longer-range MLRS, modern and truly effective air defense... Please, if your opinion is heard in the media, if you support the state in the expert field, you too can help get everything that our defense forces need. The main thing is to speak for Ukraine with one voice and defend our common interest: everything for the victory of Ukraine, everything to help our defense. Bakhmut is the hottest spot on the entire frontline - more than 1300 km of active hostilities. Since May, the occupiers have been trying to break our Bakhmut, but time goes by and Bakhmut is already breaking not only the Russian army, but also the Russian mercenaries who came to replace the wasted army of the occupiers. Just think about it: Russia has already lost almost 99 thousand of its soldiers in Ukraine. Soon there will be 100 thousand of the occupiers’ casualties. For what? No one in Moscow can answer this question. And they won&#x27;t. They wage war and waste people&#x27;s lives, other people&#x27;s lives, not of their loved ones, not their own lives, but the lives of others only because a group in the Kremlin can’t admit mistakes and is terribly afraid of reality. But reality speaks for itself. I thank all our fighters who are heroically holding the Bakhmut direction, Soledar, Avdiivka, Maryinka, Kreminna direction and the entire Donbas region, which was one of the strongest in Ukraine before Russia came, and which Russia is destroying to the scorched ground. Even such cruelty won’t give the enemy anything. Today more consumers than yesterday are disconnected from electricity. Due to several drone hits in the morning. But repairmen, as always, work very actively, around the clock. They are trying to restore power supply as soon as possible, at least at the level that generation can provide. It will be done. And one more thing, which is especially important. Today is Saint Nicholas Day - a traditional day when we all wish peace and warmth, reliable protection and victory. I believe that Nicholas will hear us. Today - just on Saint Nicholas Day - the project by Ukrzaliznytsia and UNICEF started - a joint project that can bring a holiday to Ukrainian children. To those who live near the frontline and in the de-occupied areas. Special festive trains in three directions. Today - Donetsk region. On December 21, such a festive train leaves for the Kharkiv region. On the 23rd – Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. They bring festive performances and more than 30 thousand gifts. Thank you to everyone at Ukrzaliznytsia, UNICEF and the government who organized this project. I would also like to thank UNICEF separately for more than 100 million dollars of support for Ukrainian families. More than 120,000 families, in particular those raising four or more children, children with disabilities, can receive financial assistance. In total, the program will cover more than 600,000 Ukrainians. Thank you for such support! Thank you to all those who help our people in this terrible time! Thank you to everyone who protects Ukrainians! And I want to turn now to all our friends and just conscientious people in Georgia. Probably, everyone could see the health condition of Mikheil Saakashvili now. Therefore, I appeal to the people of Georgia, to the authorities of Georgia - it is necessary to show mercy, especially on the eve of Christmas. What is happening to Mykhailo now is cruelty. This does not suit Georgia. This must be stopped. Please make a decision that can save his life. Transfer Mikheil Saakashvili to one of the clinics of Ukraine, another European country, America. It is high time to take this good step. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Support our indomitable Bakhmut and its defenders - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-20</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I’ve returned from the Donetsk region, from our Bakhmut fortress. I was there today to support our fighters, to present state awards, to express gratitude to them. To all our heroes - those who defend not only Bakhmut there, and not only our Donbas, but also the whole of Ukraine. We all should understand this. You know, on the way to the frontline, today I also passed through Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, Kostiantynivka... Cities, villages near them, which are now literally fighting for life. Life for all of us - for all Ukrainians and for everything Ukrainian, and even more so - for everything and everyone who preserves humanity inside. Look at Russia&#x27;s offensive, what it leaves where it takes its flag. Burned earth, destroyed life... Pain, ruins and graves - this is the so-called &quot;Russian world&quot;. This is what our heroes stop. This is exactly what they are expelling from Ukraine, step by step returning life to our land, where the occupiers set foot. And for this movement to exist, for our border to exist, for us to return the Ukrainian flag to the cities and villages in the south and east of our state, there is Bakhmut, there is a fortress, there are our heroic defenders. Every day they endured there, every hit they withstood there, every attack they repelled and every counterattack they carried out is a life for Ukraine. I thank all our warriors who defend the #bakhmutfortress! I am grateful to all mothers and fathers, wives and children of our heroes who are saving Ukraine right there! And I am asking all our people: wherever you are, please support the Ukrainian heroes who are holding out against the fiercest attacks of the occupiers, against the most insane Russian strikes... Support our Bakhmut - tattered yet unconquered - and his defenders. We will do everything possible and impossible, expected and unexpected, so that our heroes have everything they need to prevail. To get the results that all Ukrainians expect. That all our cities and villages on the frontline are waiting for. This is Maryinka, this is Vuhledar, this is Toretsk, this is Soledar, Klishchiivka... This is our Luhansk region, this is our south of Ukraine, this is our Crimea. Ukraine will leave nothing of its own to the enemy. This week is extremely important for Ukraine - in order to get through this winter and next year. In order to gain the necessary support and for the Ukrainian flag to finally prevail on all sections of our border - the border of Ukraine. Our fighters gave me our flag today and asked to pass it on to those whose decisions are very important for Ukraine, for all our warriors. We will definitely do it. We will definitely endure. We will definitely get the necessary support for Ukraine! Glory to all the guards of the Bakhmut fortress! Glory to all who fight for our country! Glory to our indomitable and beautiful people! And eternal memory and honor to all Ukrainians whose lives were taken by this cruel war! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We stand, we fight and we will win. Because we are united. Ukraine, America and the entire free world - address by Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a joint meeting of the US Congress</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear Americans! In all states, cities and communities. All those who value freedom and justice. Who cherish it as strongly, as we, Ukrainians, in all our cities, in each and every family. I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart! Madam Vice President, I thank you for your efforts in helping Ukraine! Madam Speaker, you bravely visited Ukraine during the full-fledged war, thank you very much! It is a great honor, a great privilege to be here! Dear members of the Congress – representatives of both parties – who also visited Kyiv! Esteemed Congressmen and Senators – from both parties – who will visit Ukraine, I’m sure, in the future! Dear representatives of diaspora – present in this chamber and spread across the country! Dear journalists! It&#x27;s a great honor for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans! Against all odds and doom and gloom scenarios, Ukraine did not fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking. And it gives me good reason to share with you our first joint victory – we defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world. We have no fear. Nor should anyone in the world have it. Ukrainians gained this victory – and it gives us courage, which inspires the entire world. Americans gained this victory – and that&#x27;s why you have succeeded in uniting the global community to protect freedom and international law. Europeans gained this victory – and that&#x27;s why Europe is now stronger and more independent than ever. The Russian tyranny has lost control over us and it will never influence our minds again. Yet, we have to do whatever it takes to ensure that countries of the Global South also gain such victory. I know one more thing – the Russians will stand a chance to be free only when they defeat the Kremlin in their minds. Yet, the battle continues! And we have to defeat the Kremlin on the battlefield. This battle is not only for the territory – for this or another part of Europe. This battle is not only for life, freedom and security of Ukrainians or any other nation, which Russia attempts to conquer. This struggle will define – in what world our children and grandchildren will live and then – their children and grandchildren. It will define whether it will be a democracy – for Ukrainians and for Americans – for all. This battle cannot be frozen or postponed. It cannot be ignored hoping that the ocean or something else will provide a protection. From the United States to China, from Europe to Latin America, and from Africa to Australia – the world is too interconnected and interdependent to allow someone to stay aside – and at the same time – to feel safe when such a battle continues. Our two nations are Allies in this battle. And next year will be a turning point. The point, when Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom. The freedom of people, who stand for their values. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! Yesterday – before coming here to Washington DC – I was at the frontline, in our Bakhmut. In our stronghold in the East of Ukraine – in the Donbas. The Russian military and mercenaries have been attacking Bakhmut non-stop since May. They have been attacking it day and night. But Bakhmut stands. Last year seventy thousand people lived there in Bakhmut and now only few civilians stay. Every inch of that land is soaked in blood. Roaring guns sound every hour. Trenches in the Donbas change hands several times a day in fierce combat and even hand fighting. But the Ukrainian Donbas stands. Russians use everything they have against Bakhmut and our other beautiful cities. The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. They have an advantage in ammunition. They have much more missiles and planes than we ever had. But our Defense Forces stand. And we all are proud of them. The Russian tactic is primitive. They burn down and destroy everything they see. They sent thugs to the frontlines. They sent convicts to the war... They threw everything against us – similar to the other tyranny, which in the Battle of the Bulge threw everything it had against the free world. Just like the brave American soldiers, which held their lines and fought back Hitler’s forces during the Christmas of 1944, brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas. Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender! So, here is the frontline – the tyranny, which has no lack of cruelty – against the lives of free people. And your support is crucial – not just to stand in such fights, but to get to the turning point. To win on the battlefield. We have artillery. Yes. Thank you. Is it enough? Honestly, not really. To ensure Bakhmut is not just a stronghold that holds back the Russian army – but for the Russian army to completely pull out – more cannons and shells are needed. If so, just like the battle of Saratoga, the fight for Bakhmut will change the trajectory of our war for independence and freedom. If your «Patriots» stop the Russian terror against our cities, it will let Ukrainian patriots work to the full to defend our freedom. When Russia cannot reach our cities by its artillery, it tries to destroy them with missile attacks. More than that, Russia found an Ally in its genocidal policy – Iran. Iranian deadly drones, sent to Russia in hundreds, became a threat to our critical infrastructure. That is how one terrorist has found the other. It is just a matter of time – when they will strike against your other allies, if we do not stop them now. We must do it! I believe there should be no taboos between us in our alliance. Ukraine never asked the American soldiers to fight on our land instead of us. I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves. Financial assistance is also critically important. And I would like to thank you for both, financial packages you have already provided us with, and the ones you may be willing to decide on. Your money is not charity. It&#x27;s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way. Russia could stop its aggression if it wanted to, but you can speed up our victory. I know it. And it will prove to any potential aggressor that no one can succeed in breaking national borders, committing atrocities and reigning over people against their will. It would be naive to wait for steps towards peace from Russia – which enjoys being a terrorist state. Russians are still poisoned by the Kremlin. The restoration of international legal order is our joint task. We need peace. Ukraine has already offered proposals, which I just discussed with President Biden – our Peace Formula. Ten points, which should and must be implemented for our joint security – guaranteed for decades ahead. And the Summit, which can be held. I am glad to stress that President Biden supported our peace initiative today. Each of you, ladies and gentlemen, can assist in its implementation – to ensure that America’s leadership remains solid, bicameral and bipartisan. You can strengthen sanctions to make Russia feel how ruinous its aggression truly is. It is in your power to help us bring to justice everyone, who started this unprovoked and criminal war. Let&#x27;s do it! Let the terrorist state be held responsible for its terror and aggression, and compensate all losses done by this war. Let the world see that the United States is here! Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! In two days, we will celebrate Christmas. Maybe, candlelit. Not because it is more romantic. But because there will be no electricity. Millions won&#x27;t have neither heating nor running water. All of this will be the result of Russian missile and drone attacks on our energy infrastructure. But we do not complain. We do not judge and compare whose life is easier. Your well-being is the product of your national security – the result of your struggle for independence and your many victories. We, Ukrainians, will also go through our war of independence and freedom with dignity and success. We&#x27;ll celebrate Christmas – and even if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out. If Russian missiles attack us – we&#x27;ll do our best to protect ourselves. If they attack us with Iranian drones and our people will have to go to bomb shelters on Christmas eve – Ukrainians will still sit down at a holiday table and cheer up each other. And we don&#x27;t have to know everyone&#x27;s wish as we know that all of us, millions of Ukrainians, wish the same – victory. Only victory. We already built strong Ukraine – with strong people, strong army, and strong institutions. Together with you! We develop strong security guarantees for our country and for entire Europe and the world. Together with you! And also – together with you! – we’ll put in place everyone, who will defy freedom. This will be the basis to protect democracy in Europe and the world over. Now, on this special Christmas time, I want to thank you. All of you. I thank every American family, which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people. I thank President Biden and both parties at the Senate and the House – for your invaluable assistance. I thank your cities and your citizens, who supported Ukraine this year, who hosted our people, who waved our national flags, who acted to help us. Thank you all! From everyone, who is now at the frontline. From everyone, who is awaiting victory. Standing here today, I recall the words of the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which are so good for this moment: &quot;The American People in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory&quot;. The Ukrainian People will win, too. Absolutely. I know that everything depends on us. On Ukrainian Armed Forces! Yet, so much depends on the world! So much in the world depends on you! When I was in Bakhmut yesterday, our heroes gave me the flag. The battle flag. The flag of those who defend Ukraine, Europe and the world at the cost of their lives. They asked me to bring this flag to the US Congress – to members of the House of Representatives and Senators, whose decisions can save millions of people. So, let these decisions be taken! Let this flag stay with you, ladies and gentlemen! This flag is a symbol of our victory in this war! We stand, we fight and we will win. Because we are united. Ukraine, America and the entire free world. May God protect our brave troops and citizens! May God forever bless the United States of America! Merry Christmas and a happy victorious new year! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>When we say &quot;patriots&quot; in Ukraine and in the United States, we equally mean the protection of the state and people - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-22</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today will be a very short address and in unusual conditions, but as always - about what we have achieved. We are returning from Washington - we are coming with good results. With something that will really help. When we say &quot;patriots&quot; in Ukraine and in the United States, we equally mean the protection of the state and people. This issue has been settled for Ukraine. There is financial support too. Also there are other agreements - more on that later. I thank President Biden for his help, his international leadership, and his determination to win. I am grateful to the Congress of the United States - both houses, both parties, all those who support Ukraine, all those who want victory as much as we all do. There will be victory! Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to everyone who defends our state! We are bringing to Ukraine, to Donbas, to Bakhmut and to the south the decisions that our Defense Forces have been waiting for. On the way home, I met with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. I thanked him, all Poles, the city - rescuer Rzeszów for everything they do for Ukraine and our protection - the protection of Europe. Today, in a special format, face to face, we discussed our interaction with Andrzej. I told him about what I heard in the United States, about our strategic vision for the next year... We are preparing, strengthening our joint forces. And one more thing - today is a professional holiday of people who give us normality, modernity and exactly the level of well-being that the terrorist state wants to destroy. Today is the Day of Energy Workers. I congratulate all of you, defenders of the Ukrainian light, and thank you for your work. We also bring new agreements to help you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every day you should feel that people&#x27;s lives and the situation in our country depend on your work - President&#x27;s speech at the Conference of Ambassadors of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-23</span></div>
  <p>We are already used to it. This means that everything is fine. If there are sirens, it means that Russia does not forget about us and is afraid of us. We will defeat everyone. Dmytro Ivanovych! Dear Mr. Minister! Dear attendees! Dear heads of diplomatic missions of our country! 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, we all have to be with Ukraine. We have no right to a weekend, no right to rest, no right to vacation, no right to an eight-hour work day. All the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine are currently on hold for us personally as representatives of our state. Because if we rest or take it lightly, if we are careless, we will have neither the Constitution of Ukraine nor our state. We must sleep less than the enemy, think more than the enemy, take risks more effectively than the enemy, and communicate with the world better, constantly, on a different level than anyone else in this world. Such an attitude should define your work. We must do everything possible and impossible, formally and informally, personally and directing the forces of the powerful, professional teams we have formed in order to strengthen the defense of our state, guarantee the safety of our people and accelerate the victory of Ukraine. Actually, these are the criteria by which I evaluate and will evaluate the effectiveness of each and every one of you, your work. We do not have time to, for example, watch the two-hour press conferences of the President of the Russian Federation. We simply do not have time for such trifles. We already know how this war will end, and therefore every hour of yours is very important, it should add up the strength of Ukraine and accelerate our victory. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine needs concrete results from each and every one of you. The results that will allow everyone who fights and works for our people, for the sake of Ukraine, to say that you stand by them, even though you are in other countries of the world. And for that to happen, you must understand how bravely and selflessly our people fight, how much they do so that the state can survive, and how much they sacrifice to preserve our free and independent life. No matter where you live and work abroad, you must still live in Ukraine and for Ukraine. No matter where you are on a working trip, you should still be with Ukraine and feel Ukrainians. The country is at war. You must be at war. Every day you should feel that the life of our state depends on your work, the lives of people and the situation on our land depend on it. Yesterday, as you know, we returned to Ukraine from the United States of America. And this was my first visit abroad after February 24 - to the key ally of our state, the United States. It was a fruitful visit. We have a decision on strengthening our air defense. The Congress is working on a powerful financial package for Ukraine and global security - 45 billion US dollars. We have significant strategic agreements with the United States for the coming months, which will definitely strengthen the capabilities of the most important thing - our defense forces in key directions. I urge you to consider this visit as a very important reference point, as a set bar. I don&#x27;t have the opportunity of foreign visits - I just don’t, there&#x27;s no time. As it was done before, in different conditions. I have opportunities to do this kind of work in other formats - and you know it, you&#x27;ve seen it. I think it was quite effective this year. But if any visit potentially has as significant, important, strategic content as my visit to the United States, if our Armed Forces, all our defense forces absolutely directly depend on the results of the visit, if one or another partner of ours is ready to take the lead in the implementation of the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, if there can be decisive steps to accelerate our victory, there can be my negotiations on a personal level as an exception to the general practice of wartime. You have to know what result you will potentially give in your direction. Fight for Ukraine, for strategic results for Ukraine! The second aspect: we must constantly create new opportunities for our state. This year we achieved historic results. It’s true. We have achieved and are increasing vital military, financial, sanction, humanitarian and other necessary support for Ukraine. Despite Russia&#x27;s all-out war against us, against each and every one, we preserved the resilience of our state. A powerful global coalition has been created around Ukraine and the protection of international security, which unites not only traditional partners, but also – what is very important – states with which relations are just being built. Ukraine united the European Union in an unprecedented way and gained the status of a candidate for joining the EU. This is a great achievement. We applied for NATO membership. Historically significant results have been achieved in our cooperation with the UN and at the UN site. This applies both to Ukrainian export initiatives and to the decisions adopted for the sake of Ukraine, in particular the resolutions of the UN General Assembly. 143 countries of the world – more than ever before – supported our territorial integrity and condemned Russian aggression. Our grain export initiative enables the world to overcome the severity of the food crisis. More than 14 million tons of agricultural products were exported - you know - to more than forty countries of the world. We also launched the Grain from Ukraine humanitarian initiative. Both initiatives put our state in the same line with those who really guarantee global security for the whole world. And next year, we will increase this, I believe, very important activity of ours. Special attention is paid to those regions and continents where our interests are so far represented less than we need for the good of Ukraine and our protection against Russian aggression. In particular, this is Africa. We are already restarting relations with dozens of African countries. We have to step it up next year. Ten countries have already been determined where new embassies of Ukraine in Africa will be opened. We also developed the concept of the &quot;Ukraine - Africa&quot; trading house with the opening of its offices in the capitals of the most promising countries of the African continent. In addition to the existing representation of Ukraine in ten African countries - along with new embassies and trading houses - we must achieve representation in thirty countries of the African continent. Global growth and international stability in this century cannot be imagined without relations with Africa and other parts of the Global South: Latin America, India, other Asian countries, including China and Southeast Asia, the entire region of the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Ukraine must find the format of its leadership in strategic processes in each of these regions, and the role of the diplomatic corps of Ukraine will be decisive. We need passports for Ukraine&#x27;s relations with each country, as it is currently done by us with African countries. I think the ministers, my colleagues, diplomatic institutions will explain this to you in more detail. We need clarity and defined intersection of our interests with partners and potential partners. It is necessary to bring the capacity of Ukraine to a new level in the foreign policy of emergency situations. We need such a tool that will enable our state to respond to crisis situations in the world. Our presence should be felt by absolutely everyone, everyone should be interested in our help. To this end, we are preparing the creation of the Ukrainian International Aid Agency, which will expand the geography of our influence and form additional lines of cooperation with partners. As we ensure the sustainability of our country together with our partners, we can also help other countries maintain and develop sustainability. As an example, we can consider our cooperation with partners in the field of food security, in the field of digitization and - which is very important, where we have really important developments - in cyber defense. We have experience that can strengthen our partners and give Ukraine new friends in the world. Of course, all this requires updating the regulations and ensuring the work of our diplomats. To this end, I commission the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prepare an ambitious draft of amendments to the Law of Ukraine on the Diplomatic Service. The system of work of embassies must be updated. In order for embassies to be able to work truly as a team, the approach to the formation of the embassy team must be changed. The ambassador is responsible for the result, and therefore the ambassador needs to influence the formation of the embassy team. It will be done. Of course, injustice in financing the work of our representative offices, in particular in Africa, will also be corrected. The third aspect: the world should know about the needs of Ukraine and the needs of our people. Not only politicians, but also business, the very important media environment, and the civil sector. This is critically necessary for the reconstruction of Ukraine, for the restoration and development of the social and investment opportunities of our state, as well as for the pressure on Russia for this shameful war, for terror, to constantly increase. Our embassies and our state should be heard and seen in the countries of your direct work. In particular, one of your tasks, in addition to the general task of popularizing Ukraine, should be the organization of visits of those who can actually become and are newsmakers in the country of your stay. Take a look at examples of what has been done this year. Just a few examples, there were many of them, but still... For example, the Crimea Platform summit of the parliamentary dimension in Croatia - it was done jointly by the teams of Ruslan Stefanchuk, the government, the Office, all our diplomats. The conference on strengthening our energy sector and infrastructure in general, which took place in France and where Ukraine was represented by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Yulia Svyrydenko and Rostyslav Shurma. Agreements were reached in the amount of about 2 billion euros. The visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to Washington, her speech in Congress, meetings after which the possibility of a powerful strengthening of air defense opened up for Ukraine. A very important visit. Agreements regarding grain, which were dealt with by the team of Oleksandr Kubrakov and the team of the Office. The release of our prisoners of war, in particular the defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal, which was ensured by the team led by Andriy Yermak, Kyrylo Budanov and Rustem Umyerov, which is extremely important. The activity, which was aimed at obtaining candidate status, historical candidate status, and the corresponding visits and negotiations of Dmytro Kuleba, Olha Stefanishyna, Andriy Sybiha, Ihor Zhovkva, Emine Dzhaparova, Oleksiy Chernyshov - this entire team. We need this level of events for Ukraine next year. We need to create events that could talk about Ukraine and our interests. Political events of strategic importance. You should focus on this and ensure at least one such event per month for the sake of Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! Today, several special, very important areas of work in the coming year will be presented to you. In particular, the Head of my Office will present what can be done to implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula. I want to emphasize: this is a practical thing. Not some kind of abstraction, not some trick, not a rhetorical tool. This is a specific task, points that must be implemented in order to restore the territorial integrity of our state and guarantee the security of Ukraine and Ukrainians. There are more specific tasks for us for the next year. Now, if you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;m going to outline some of them, those we need to implement to make the next year a truly victorious year for all of us. So. Start of negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the EU. Preparation for the planned NATO summit and ensuring concrete results of this summit for Ukraine, which we all know about. Each of you will be presented with our updated defense and security needs for our army. You must constantly work to satisfy them. Ukrainian energy sector and, in general, the needs of our country for recovery after the Russian strikes, Fast Recovery Plan - please work as closely as possible with the government, the Office, international organizations and partner states, so that all these existing agreements are provided with a concrete content and result. Sanctions against Russia. We have to ensure new strong sanction packages next year. The terrorist state must feel real pressure, and your actions - the actions of our diplomatic corps - must be aimed at this. The Tribunal for the crime of aggression and the accountability of war criminals - work to ensure that the countries of your stay support us. Help find and block Russia’s assets linked not only to government officials, but also to Russian businesses that support the war. All these funds will be directed to the restoration of Ukraine. Do everything you can to ensure that the countries in which you work help build an effective compensation mechanism. And be sure to support our people not just as much as you can, but much more. They are facing extremely hard times. Work for our people to return to the state and for all their rights and legitimate interests in the host countries are satisfied. Ukrainian identity, Ukrainian cultural, educational, information and social needs must be satisfied. In everything, take as an example our work on &quot;Patriots&quot;, &quot;NASAMS&quot;, &quot;IRIS-T&quot;, &quot;Crotale&quot;. We were told that it was impossible. That all this was impossible. Now it&#x27;s all there. Diplomacy is just such a tool. Everything that faces a &quot;no&quot; at the beginning must become a concrete result for all of us. The implementation of all the tasks I mentioned today is not only a specific work plan for the next year. We must understand: this is our victory, these are the elements of this victory. When we implement a specific task, we accelerate victory for Ukraine, accelerate victory for our people. The most important task for all of us is victory in this war. We must, and we will get it! Glory to all our warriors! Gratitude to everyone who works for our victory! Thank you for all your work for our state in a particularly difficult time after February 24! I sincerely congratulate you on your day, your professional day - the Day of Diplomatic Service Employees - and I wish you all to achieve even more results in the coming year than this year. I wish you all a Merry Christmas, happy holidays, and a Happy New Year. May this year be victorious! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We see prospects at the front, we see terrorist state&#x27;s intentions and we will respond – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-23</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I held a meeting of the Staff today. It was as always substantive, but today more news for the troops after a visit to the United States. We are preparing for the coming months and next year in general. Our tasks are unchanged. It is the liberation of our land. Safety for our people. Restoration of our country after the Russian strikes. These are the elements of the Ukrainian victory, which we are approaching step by step. We heard today the commanders&#x27; reports at the Staff meeting. We see prospects at the front. We are preparing for different variants of actions of the terrorist state, we see its intentions. And we will respond. The situation in the energy sector was discussed separately. Today I held an important annual meeting with the ambassadors of Ukraine – the entire diplomatic corps of our country received tasks for the next year. We are preparing to step up Ukrainian diplomacy in several directions. The first are the countries in which our influence is still less than we need from the point of view of the national security of Ukraine and the interests of our people. First of all, these are the countries of Africa and other parts of the Global South – Latin America, Asian countries, and the Pacific region. This is a huge economic potential, and it is also a significant diplomatic opportunity. For example, during the voting of the UN General Assembly for resolutions that protect our territorial integrity and international law. We will strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s position. The second aspect of Ukrainian diplomacy is to increase cooperation with our traditional partners so that the next year will really be decisive in this war and Ukraine will achieve all its goals. We are preparing to upgrade the diplomatic service, we will strengthen the Ukrainian embassies. There was also a non-public part of our meeting with diplomats today – I focused on several important, sensitive points in communication with the ambassadors. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. I am grateful for the new support package – very important, timely EUR 2.5 billion for Ukraine. Of course, our joint actions with the Netherlands next year were also discussed. We are coordinating the steps as much as possible, and I believe that there will be a tangible result, especially in the matter of bringing to justice all those who are guilty of this aggression against Ukraine. And one more. It was an honor for me to congratulate those people who, together with their colleagues, are restoring our systems after the Russian strikes. I believe that all of us should thank more often those who work for the preservation of our well-being and normal life. Not political at all. Maybe not always visible to most. But thanks to many of these people, Ukraine is living. In particular, anyone and everyone who repairs the grids and generation facilities damaged by the strikes, before the air alert has even ended, to give people power faster, is the true hero. Everyone who goes to the de-occupied and front-line areas to return everything for normal life to people is the real hero. Everyone who stabilizes our power system every day and every night, ensures the supply of electricity, the operation of plants and other energy facilities – all of them, along with others who fight and work for Ukraine, guarantee Ukraine&#x27;s future. Thank you for that! I signed decrees on awarding our troops. 215 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards. Glory to all who defend our state! Thanks to all our partners who help us and together with us are securing victory over tyranny! And please remember who is fighting against us. With the approaching holiday season, Russian terrorists may become active again. They despise Christian values and any values in general. Therefore, please heed the air raid signals, help each other and always take care of each other. And more. Citizens of Russia must clearly understand that terror never goes unanswered. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Christmas greetings of the President of Ukraine to Western Rite Orthodox Christians</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-24</span></div>
  <p>Dear people! These days, millions of people in Ukraine and the world celebrate Christmas. The appearance of the Son of God gave people hope for salvation, faith in the victory of goodness and mercy. Unfortunately, all the holidays have a bitter aftertaste for us this year. And we can feel the traditional Spirit of Christmas differently. Dinner at the family table cannot be so tasty and warm. There may be empty chairs around it. And our houses and streets can&#x27;t be so bright. And Christmas bells can ring not so loudly and inspiringly. Through air raid sirens, or even worse – gunshots and explosions. And all this together can pose a bigger threat. It is a disappointment. Of the higher forces and their power, of goodness and justice in the world. Loss of hope. Loss of love. Loss of myself... But isn&#x27;t this what evil and darkness, which have taken up arms against us, want in their essence? We have been resisting them for more than three hundred days and eight years. And will we allow them to achieve what they want? In this battle, we have another powerful and effective weapon. The hammer and sword of our spirit and consciousness. The wisdom of God. Courage and bravery. Virtues that incline us to do good and overcome evil. The main act of courage is endurance and completion of one&#x27;s work to the end, despite everything. The truth illuminates our path. We know it. We defend it. Our truth is a struggle for freedom. Freedom comes at a high price. But slavery has an even higher price. Our path is illuminated by faith and patience. Patience and faith. These are twin forces. As it was said, &quot;he who rules and controls his own spirit, is better than he who captures a city.&quot; To endure does not mean to accept the circumstances. Patience is watching to make sure that we don&#x27;t let any doubt or fear into our minds. It is faith in one&#x27;s own strength. Evil has no weapon stronger than the armor given to us by God. Evil smashes against this armor like a stone wall. We have seen this more than once. We endured at the beginning of the war. We endured attacks, threats, nuclear blackmail, terror, missile strikes. Let&#x27;s endure this winter because we know what we are fighting for. We go forward through the thorns to the stars, knowing what awaits us at the end of the road. God is a just Judge who rewards good and punishes evil. Which side we are on is obvious. Who is who in this battle is obvious. There are at least seven proofs of this – they are known - &quot;A proud look, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood, An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, Feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaketh lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.&quot; We oppose all this. Being a role model for others. The faithful, that is, those who really believe, must be a light to the rest of the world. For more than three hundred days, Ukrainians have been striving for this, proving it, serving as an example to others. We are not righteous, not holy, but we are definitely fighting for good and fighting for the light, with faith in Bible prophecy: &quot;Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. The people who walk in darkness will see a bright light. The light will shine on those who live in the land of death&#x27;s shadow. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given!&quot; We believe that tears will be replaced by joy, hope will come after despair, and death will be defeated by life. Dear Ukrainian people! Today and all future winter holidays we meet in difficult circumstances. Someone will see the first star in the sky over Bakhmut, Rubizhne, and Kreminna today. Along thousands of kilometers of the front line. Someone is on the road, on the way – from the Ukrainian-Polish border to Kherson region or Zaporizhzhia. Someone will see it through the bullet holes of his or her own home. Someone will celebrate the holiday in other people&#x27;s homes, but strange people&#x27;s homes – homes of Ukrainians who gave shelter to Ukrainians. In Zakarpattia, Bukovyna, Lviv region, Ivano-Frankivsk region and many other regions. Someone will hear Shchedryk in another language - in Warsaw, Berlin, London, New York, Toronto and many other cities and countries. And someone will meet this Christmas in captivity, but let them remember that we are also coming for our people, we will return freedom to all Ukrainian men and women. Wherever we are, we will be together today. And together we will look at the evening sky. And together we will remember the morning of February 24. Let&#x27;s remember how much we have passed. Let&#x27;s remember Azovstal, Irpin, Bucha, Kramatorsk, Snake Island, Chornobayivka, Izium, Kherson. We make a wish. One for all. And we will feel joy. One for all. And we will understand the truth. One for all. About the fact that no kamikaze drones are capable of extinguishing the Christmas Dawn. We will see its glow even underground in a bomb shelter. We will fill our hearts with warmth and light. No Kinzhal missile can hurt them. They will break against our steel spirit. And our struggle will continue without stopping. It is not threatened by planned or emergency blackouts. And we will never feel a shortage of courage and indomitability. We have experienced a lot of bitter news and will deservedly receive good news. We will sing Christmas carols – cheerier than ever – louder than the sound of a generator. We will hear the voices and greetings of relatives – in our hearts – even if communication service and the Internet are down. And even in total darkness – we will find each other – to hug each other tightly. And if there is no heat, we will give a big hug to warm each other. We will celebrate our holidays! As always. We will smile and be happy. As always. The difference is one. We will not wait for a miracle. After all, we create it ourselves. Christ is born! Let&#x27;s praise Him!</p>

  <h2>The darkness will not prevent us from leading the occupiers to their new defeats - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-25</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today, millions of people celebrate Christmas according to the Gregorian calendar. And I once again congratulate everyone who is celebrating right now, these days. And I want us to once again express gratitude - together - to all those who both these days and at any other time are doing everything so that we can live. Live our life and in our country. I thank each of our warriors - all military personnel. All fighters of the Air Forces, anti-aircraft fighters, intelligence officers, border guards, national guardsmen, warriors of the territorial defense, Naval Forces. Thank you to every soldier and sailor, to every sergeant and sergeant-major, to every officer and general who are holding the front and trying to push it further - to our borders that we have to reach. Thanks to everyone who repairs and supplies equipment. To everyone who volunteers. Thanks to all our medics and everyone who saves the wounded on the battlefield. Thank you to all the nurses who perform their work selflessly under any circumstances. Thank you to everyone who helps provide hospitals with everything necessary. To all those who come to donate blood for the wounded... And to all those who came now in Kherson to help. To save the wounded from the attack of terrorists on Christmas... Artillery and mortars against ordinary streets of Kherson... Savages! We will find every Russian murderer. And I thank everyone who works for this: all investigative teams, all prosecutors, officials and diplomats. Thank you to each and everyone who helps get Ukrainians out of captivity. Thank you to all our energy workers and repairmen, sappers, policemen, employees of the State Emergency Service, utility workers. Thank you to the educators who continue to build our future and the builders who take care of our present. Thank you to the transporters who keep our economy alive and the financiers who maintain our stability. Thank you to the IT specialists who chose Ukraine. Thank you to officials who care about people and businesses who help society to be resilient. Thank you to our farmers, thank you to the agrarians who did not give up last spring and are preparing for the next one. Thank you to all journalists who spread the truth and public figures who help our people to keep faith in themselves and in victory. Thank you to all the leaders and peoples of the world, who this year, together with Ukraine, became leaders in the defense of freedom and next year, I believe, together with us, will do everything to become leaders of peace. It&#x27;s possible. Fellow Ukrainians! There are only a few days left this year. We must be aware that our enemy will try to make this time dark and difficult for us. Russia lost everything it could this year. But it is trying to compensate for its losses with the gloating of its propagandists after the missile strikes at our country, at our energy sector. I know that the darkness will not prevent us from leading the occupiers to their new defeats. But we have to be ready for any scenario. Please pay attention to air alarms these days. Search again and remember where the nearest Point of Invincibility is located. Tell your parents how to find the Point of Invincibility if needed. More than 5,500 points have already been opened throughout the country. Please take care of yourself. And be ready to help others. When Ukrainians are together, when Ukrainians are grateful to each other, we cannot be defeated. May it always be so! And it will be so, I&#x27;m sure! Glory to our strong, beautiful, best people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The situation in Donbas is difficult; I thank our guys who hold their positions firmly and find opportunities to &quot;subtract&quot; the occupiers - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-26</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on today - another day of another week of our resistance. First. The frontline. Bakhmut, Kreminna and other areas in Donbas, which now require maximum strength and concentration. The situation there is difficult, acute. The occupiers are using all the resources available to them - and these are significant resources - to squeeze out at least some advance. And I thank all our guys who hold their positions firmly, stand strong, and who nevertheless find opportunities not only to not lose anything, but also to drive the occupiers out, to &quot;subtract&quot; them. Today I want to celebrate the 10th separate mountain assault brigade for capturing the occupiers in the Donetsk region. It is very important. This will enable us to release more Ukrainians. I will also celebrate the 80th and 95th separate airborne assault brigades for the successful destruction of the enemy force in the Lyman direction. Well done, guys! The more the occupiers lose, the more time we all gain for Ukraine. Second. Energy sector. I want to thank all the workers of the energy companies, all the repair crews for the fact that this Saturday and Sunday - on Christmas Eve and Christmas - it was possible to give people more energy. Of course, deficits remain. Shutdowns continue. As of this evening, about 9 million people are disconnected in various regions of Ukraine. But the number and duration of outages is still gradually decreasing. I am thankful to each and everyone who made this result possible. Today I held a special meeting with government officials regarding the situation in the energy and infrastructure spheres. We are preparing for the next year - and not only for the winter months. There are threats that we have to eliminate. There are steps that need to be taken. And the state will definitely take them. Third. Today I held an extended meeting on the results of the visit to the USA and the implementation of the agreements. We will not waste time. We will quickly implement everything that was agreed upon in Washington. As much as possible. And one more thing. Today I spoke with the Prime Minister of India. Next year, it will be India that will preside over the G20. I wished Mr. Modi a fruitful presidency, and fruitful not for someone in particular, but for everyone in the world who values peace. India can be more active in efforts to end aggression, so I hope we can do more together for global stability in the coming year. Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine regardless of whether it&#x27;s a holiday, a weekend, or a weekday! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps our country! And please don&#x27;t forget to be prepared for Russian missile attacks or provocations. Air defense is preparing, the state is preparing, and everyone must prepare. Please pay attention to the sirens. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are entering the next year and must retain a common understanding of national goals - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-27</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held a meeting of the Staff today - the 44th of this year already. The topic is clear. First of all, it is Bakhmut, Kreminna and Donbas in general. Possible actions of the enemy in the eastern direction and our actions. We listened to the commanders, decided on steps for the near future. We continue to prepare the defense and security forces of Ukraine for the next year. It must be a crucial year. We understand the risks in the winter, we understand what we have to do in the spring, and therefore we understand what results the entire defense and security sector must demonstrate. The supply of ammunition and the repair of military equipment was discussed separately. By the way, I want to thank our specialists, all our partners, everyone involved in the relevant work. We managed to establish a system to not only return repaired equipment to the battlefield, but also to take trophy equipment from the battlefield and put it at the service of our country. This is a very important result of the year, everyone involved did a great job. I spoke today with the Prime Minister of Italy. I thanked for the support already provided and for the new support. Mrs. Meloni said that the issue of air defense for Ukraine is currently under consideration and we have coordinated our steps. I believe that Italian support will allow us to strengthen the defense of the Ukrainian sky. Of course, we also discussed our diplomatic plans for the coming months. And also the winter threats, which I am sure we will overcome together. I held a meeting today regarding the work of the banking system and our cooperation with the IMF. We must provide even more opportunities for Ukrainians in the coming year and guarantee the strength of our banking and financial systems. I also spoke with the head of the world&#x27;s largest investment fund, BlackRock. I received another confirmation that the business of the developed world believes in our victory and is ready to invest in our reconstruction. Specialists of this company are already helping Ukraine to structure the Fund for the reconstruction of our state. And we are already preparing to participate in the World Economic Forum in Davos. The position and prospects of Ukraine will be presented there. In general, this week will be important for Ukraine from a political point of view. We are entering the next year and must retain a common understanding of our national goals. Of course, this is the liberation of our land from the enemy, as well as the restoration of Ukraine, the return of our people home, the further rapprochement of our state with key partners, the opening of new opportunities for Ukraine in the world - these are all tasks for the near future. And not only for the state, but also for each and every one of us. Soon I will present my view on the implementation of these tasks in the annual Message to the Verkhovna Rada on the external and internal situation of Ukraine. I want this Message to be not a report, but our conversation about the coming year. Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who fights for our independence! Thank you to all the units of our defense forces, which bring the defeat of the enemy closer! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Speech by the President with the annual message to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the internal and external situation of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-28</span></div>
  <p>Glory to Ukraine! Dear Mr. Chairman, dear people&#x27;s deputies of our strong Ukraine, dear government officials! Dear guests, dear attendees! Dear Ukrainian warriors! Ukrainian people! Let&#x27;s talk about Ukraine today. About how everyone has changed in these 10 months. And about how we changed the whole world. About our strength. All this time we were one. Just like now in this hall, when everyone answered - &quot;Glory to the heroes&quot;. Glory to Ukraine! Due to our unity, we have achieved what almost no one in the world, in the whole world, believed in. Almost no one except us. Ukraine has become one of the global leaders. Our national colors are today an international symbol of courage and indomitability of the whole world. In any country, on any continent, when they see blue and yellow, they know that it is about freedom. About the people who did not give up, who endured, who united the world. And who will win. Thanks to Ukraine, the world believed that values give strength. This belief emerged following our struggle. The world became convinced that tyranny will lose. Following our faith. The world saw that freedom can be victorious. Following our achievements on the battlefield. And all our warriors. It will definitely happen. Ukraine will definitely win. In 10 months of this year, we helped everyone. We helped the West find itself again, return to the global arena and feel how much the West prevails. No one in the West is afraid of Russia anymore and will never be. We helped the European Union acquire real agency. We helped Europe feel like not several championships with teams of different levels, but one strong team that, together with the whole free world, is fighting for this important victory. It was Ukraine that united the European Union. It turned out that it is possible! And now Europe defends itself. Europe overcomes crises. And this is despite the colossal resources thrown by Russia to break our continent. Everything that Russia tried to do against Europe did not work. Every Russian step was a mistake. And our steps did work. And for the first time in history, the European Union is helping to defend against such large-scale aggression. For the first time, a number of EU countries have changed their legislation and political rules and are now providing armed support to our state. For the first time in history, some European countries have reconsidered the concept of neutrality and resist aggression together with us, together with Ukraine. We helped Europe and most of the world feel that being neutral now is, pardon me, immoral. 143 states voted for the resolution of the UN General Assembly in support of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the full implementation of the UN Charter. This is a really striking example. This is the biggest number in 10 months and 8 years. And I thank everyone who worked for this result. Unprecedentedly actively. Congratulations! This is a great victory! During this time after February 24, I alone had 850 international events. And this is how our entire diplomatic corps worked. Now I want to thank everyone who worked just like that, just as powerfully. All our diplomats, all our government officials and, of course, those people&#x27;s deputies who helped the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Office build a pro-Ukrainian coalition in the world. I thank you! And I am thankful to all the leaders and nations who help us defend our independence, protect international law! Thank you to the honorable ambassadors of the countries - partners of ours, who are now present here, in this distinguished hall! Fellow Ukrainians! Look at how global priorities have changed. Most of the countries of the world are no longer interested in whether Russia will hear them. That&#x27;s no longer the case. Now the world is really interested in what else to expect from Ukraine, what else Ukraine can give to Europe, what we can give to the world. For many people in the world, it is now pride to have friends among Ukrainians. Remember how Ukrainians once wanted to have friends among foreigners. And now we are truly one with the world - with the strongest, with the freest in the world. We restore faith in values to millions of people in different countries. In the values that parents teach their children anywhere in the free world. We show that life should really depend on such values. We actualize the meanings. Meanings that were, unfortunately, only barren letters of some international agreements, conventions and memoranda for a long time. They will work. And we show it. We give each of our partners a unique and very important feeling and a historic opportunity - to be a winner together with Ukraine. Thanks to Ukrainians, the world remembers what it means to be winners. Next year we will only strengthen it. This year, we obtained for Ukraine the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. But our achievement is not only in this. This is only part of the achievement. Ukraine has long deserved this status. We know. Even 20 years ago, we could have been there, with this status. Now our achievement is much greater. Ukraine cements. It cements the European Union and the entire free world with the struggle for freedom and peace. This is our main achievement in foreign policy for the past year. We made it obvious to everyone that no union in Europe would be strong without Ukraine. And that is why in all the countries of the European Union, a clear majority of citizens supported Ukraine and the idea of Ukraine joining the EU, and the majority sees us in the Alliance. It is time to start negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union. Fellow Ukrainians! I want us now to thank all those who opened this opportunity and this path to us. I want us to thank our warriors. Warriors! Our warriors, exactly warriors, Ukrainian heroes, are not just servicemen. Not just soldiers and sailors, not just sergeants, not just officers and generals. The warriors are the hope of millions of people for life. They are Europe&#x27;s hope for peace. They are the hope of the world that the time of empires cannot return. Ukrainian warriors gain peace for us. And they will gain it! Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! To the National Guard, our border guards, our intelligence, Security Service, Special Operations Forces, National Police! Glory to all our Defense and Security Forces! Glory to Ukraine! Today, the Ukrainian warriors prove that greatness does not depend on the size of the state, the stockpile of missiles, or the ability to force someone into something. Greatness depends on the strength of morale of those who defend their home, defend the freedom of their people. The Ukrainian warriors ousted the invaders from around Kyiv, and this was the first turning point in the full-scale war. It showed the strength of our resistance. The Ukrainian warriors freed Zmiinyi, and since then every occupier knows the only answer he will hear from the Ukrainians to any of his encroachments. This showed that nothing can stop Ukraine. The number of flagships has somewhat decreased in the Black Sea, and one infamous bridge is increasingly operating for exit rather than entry. If it is operating, of course. And it showed what the future would be like. It will be Ukrainian. The active actions of our Defense and Security Forces in the Kharkiv region turned many pages of old history. Perhaps, the Russian army did not know that it was capable of fleeing so quickly. Fleeing, leaving everything behind - positions, weapons, their soldiers and collaborators. The occupiers fled, although they had an advantage in this direction - in the number of weapons, equipment and soldiers. But our warriors had - and have - another great advantage. A more significant one. The advantage in determination, the advantage of the strength of your land under your feet. We reinforce this advantage of Ukrainian warriors with powerful weapons. We have such weapons for the first time. HIMARS and Krab, Harpoon and NASAMS, Bayraktar and M777 howitzers, CAESAR, Bushmaster, IRIS-T, Crotale - I have named only a few of the dozens of types of the best weapons in the world, which our warriors already have or will have. I am grateful to our partners! We have already managed to liberate more than one thousand eight hundred cities and villages of Ukraine from the Russian occupier. And I thank all the states that help us overcome Russian tyranny right on the battlefield! And let me remind you that a year ago it seemed impossible that our country would have Patriot air defense systems. Now we have such an agreement. I am grateful to our strategic partners! This is a special sign of trust in Ukraine. This is a true alliance with the United States of America. We have achieved this. And I have a debt after my visit to the United States, which I want to pay off right now. Captain Pavlo Cherniavskyi is now in this hall, commander of the HIMARS battery who was awarded the Cross of Combat Merit and who presented this award to President of the United States of America Biden. It was an honor to carry out this special mission. But it also has a second part. In response, President Biden handed over a Command Coin – a special symbol from the President of the United States of America. Mr. Captain! Pavlo! I have to give this Command Coin to you now. Once again, I want to thank President Biden, both parties of Congress and every American family for the historical support of Ukraine and our citizens. Thank you! Fellow Ukrainians! You see, dear Ukrainians, how the whole world helps us and how we get advanced weapons. Rest assured, the time will come when the whole world will be equally interested in Ukrainian weapons brands. We are capable of producing our missiles, our naval drones, we are already doing it, armored vehicles, aircraft and other types of weapons. We are already doing it. There is ours already. It&#x27;s all ours. &quot;Stugna&quot;, &quot;Vilkha&quot;, &quot;Neptune&quot;, marine drone and others. Let&#x27;s thank our domestic production. Ukraine and the Ukrainian military-industrial complex was and will be one of the most powerful in Europe and the world, I am sure of that. The intensity of hostilities, the depth of the evil that Russia has brought, the volume and brutality of the crimes of the occupiers on our Ukrainian land encourage not only us, but also the whole world to update defense standards, update security standards, and achieve justice. And this applies to many areas. From the production of projectiles and tactics on the battlefield to the creation of a new effective security architecture for Ukraine, for all of Europe and the world, new security guarantees. From the launch of legal mechanisms to bring to justice all those guilty of aggression and to compensate at the expense of Russia for all the damage caused by this terror, to the reform of existing international organizations that are supposed to guarantee peace, guarantee international law and order, but are unable to do so now. Ukraine is already among the leaders of the relevant processes. And, by the way, it is in Ukraine that new NATO standards are defined by our heroic warriors. Standards we share with our allies today. Allies! Not just partners. But in order to get to that time and those opportunities, we have to come to an agreement between ourselves now. All of us in this hall, in Ukraine, within our people, our society. The first point is unity. We have to cherish it despite any personal emotions, any personal interests. Unity is what allows us now to strengthen society, strengthen our state, win together and change the negative trends of our centuries-old history. The stronger the unity, the greater and faster our victory will be. We must be equal in unity. Equal in unity. And this is now a challenge. A very important point. No one at the front will understand those who, having any political weight or any position of authority, will try to return to the old life. Life before February 24. And if someone tries to play against the independence of Ukraine - be it political, economic, or spiritual independence - our state will respond instantly and in a tough way. There is no such gold for crosses or anything else in the world that could cover the moral rust from ties with a terrorist state. And if someone from the political class of Ukraine thinks that when he skis down the mountain, he motivates the soldiers to climb out of the trenches and go on the offensive, this is a sign of madness, and there will be no such people in politics. I urge everyone to leave their personal ambitions at home and work to protect our common home. Work together with the state and in a way that is necessary to protect freedom and our people. When such a brutal war is ongoing, it is not the time for personal political guerrilla activity somewhere in the rear, in the media, or even more so in the capitals of the countries that help us. Please take my words as seriously as possible. Ukraine is on its way to the victory that generations of our people have dreamed of. Now our children dream of it. Our parents and grandparents dreamed of it. All generations from the time of Bohdan to the national liberation struggle of the XX century. We will get what we did not achieve before. We will. And this is possible thanks to the fact that for the first time in several centuries we simultaneously have national unity, our own functioning state and the maximum unity of the world in supporting our beautiful Ukraine. We will not let anyone &quot;roll it back&quot; to the old days. People will not allow it. The world will not allow it. Our unity must be as strong as our warriors. The second point is security. Being one of the global leaders is not a status or an award. This is an ongoing process. The process of finding new opportunities for our state, new friends and alliances, new growth for the economy and for our society. In the same way, the security of the state is not a state that you achieve once and for all, it is difficult work, it is a process. Leadership and security always go hand in hand - by acquiring one, you work for the other. Now, when the enemy has set himself the goal of destroying us, destroying our energy sector, we set ourselves the goal of becoming a leader in the transformation of our energy sector to counter any threats, any challenges - military, political, economic or even climatic. We have to become - and we will become, as there is no other option - a leader in building modern green energy. This will allow us to create a decentralized energy system that cannot be destroyed by anything, any missile strikes. Today - everyone can see - it is dangerous when cities depend on several large thermal or power plants. A modern city needs decentralized sources of energy. Only green energy can really provide this. Having a leadership position in such energy and developing our atomic generation, as well as hydrogen energy, we will be able to provide for the needs of Ukraine, and in peacetime - the needs of Europe. And this will be a historic strengthening of Ukraine&#x27;s role in Europe. We can, and therefore must, become one of the guarantors of European energy security. And this is a task, a task for tomorrow. And today we have to get through and we will definitely get through this winter. Russian missile and, as they say, &quot;shahed&quot; strikes at our energy sector, at the energy supply of Ukrainians, is an obvious challenge not only to our state, by the way. When terror strikes against the civilization of life, the world can stand up for both civilization and life. We do everything for this. I want to thank everyone who advocates for increasing international pressure on Russia for this terror! And I thank all the countries and companies, international organizations and people who supply us with equipment and provide financial support to provide the people of Ukraine with light, heat and communication! Thank you! One example - we will increase the number of Starlink terminals in Ukraine, which clearly prove the superiority of civilization over terror and barbarism, to more than thirty thousand in the near future. We are already becoming - and we will become - a leader in the digital transformation of our state and society. I think it is not necessary to dwell separately on what we have achieved in the field of digitization and communication. I will only say that this is an achievement of such importance that allows us to make our country&#x27;s experience in digitization one of the tools of foreign policy. We will complete the total digitization of all permits and public services in Ukraine. This is about anti-corruption and about the stability of the institutions of our state. And what is important, by spreading such experience of transformation, successful experience in the world, we will provide Ukraine with new friends, new alliances, new political and economic opportunities. In particular, this will concern the development of relations with African countries and other states of the Global South. This direction of foreign policy received a special priority. We are already becoming - and we will become - the leader of global efforts for food security. This year has shown that without a Ukrainian farmer, without Ukrainian agricultural exports, it is impossible to guarantee not only food, but also social security for dozens of countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. Our two initiatives - the Export Grain Initiative and the &quot;Grain from Ukraine&quot; program - have returned the world to vital stability. More than fifteen million tons of food for export to more than forty countries of the world in just five months in conditions of full-scale war is our first grain initiative. And I want to thank the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, I thank President of Türkiye Erdoğan for supporting the restoration of our agricultural exports. Already more than thirty donor countries and almost two hundred million dollars - this is our second grain initiative, a humanitarian one. The European Union and Qatar, Türkiye and Japan, Norway and Korea, Canada and the United States of America - this is just the beginning of the global humanitarian corridor for countries facing the threat of famine. Famine caused by Russia. Even now, when it&#x27;s hard for us, we share our Ukrainian bread with those for whom it is even harder. I thank you for this - everyone who did it! This moral leadership of Ukraine and our partners is undeniable. Ukraine must always look for ways to show leadership, to attract other leaders, and every such success will strengthen our security, strengthen the external situation of our state. But also the internal one. Our export initiatives and, in general, the expansion of opportunities for freight transportation through the territory of the European Union, Türkiye - allowed us to save millions of jobs for Ukrainians. Dear attendees! I am asking you now to thank all our transporters, all our port workers, all those who work on the railways, in every other industry that ensures the movement of goods for Ukrainians! Another important security element. Business is also the protection of Ukraine now. Taxes are also security now. This year we had no delays - or almost no delays - with the salaries of our beloved teachers and doctors. Pensions were indexed, as provided by the legislation of Ukraine. In the de-occupied territory, payments were made as soon as stabilization measures were completed there. More than one trillion two hundred billion hryvnias are allocated to defense for the year. Of course, the financial assistance of partners and other involved funds played an important role, that&#x27;s true. But. But there is a but. We must remember that the financing of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is primarily an internal resource from Ukrainian taxes, customs duties, bonds and other similar sources. And every unpaid hryvnia of taxes is money taken from our military. This is the fact. Of course, the existing tax system is convenient neither for those who pay taxes nor for those who collect taxes. It is also not convenient for those of our people who receive salaries and pensions from these taxes. But it is extremely important for us to reach a national agreement on this issue. Now I want to thank everyone who keeps their businesses running, who keeps jobs so that people can provide for themselves and their families, who pays taxes. Gratitude to all of you! I want to emphasize this again and want you all to know: very important international aid goes to important social benefits. And the entire resource for the salaries of the military is paid by the citizens of Ukraine. The third point is justice. The creation of the Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression is an integral part of the policy of our state. I am sure that the Tribunal will work. The International compensation mechanism, which we are currently building, will also work. At the same time, we must cooperate as much as possible with our international partners, with the International Criminal Court. That is, all elements of international and national justice will be used to bring to justice the Russian murderers and torturers, all those who planned, started and are carrying out aggression against the people of Ukraine. No crime committed by the occupiers in Ukraine can go unpunished. And no matter how much resources and time it takes, accountability for the occupiers must be unavoidable. And it will be so! For everything that was done against Ukraine, that was done against Ukrainians from 2014 and from February 24. Can the state alone ensure this? No. And I want to thank our partners, in particular, the Netherlands, for their principled leadership in this work; all our investigators, experts, prosecutors, all our judges who are already working on this, and all journalists and public activists who joined justice. Thank you! I am also thankful to those who help us find and block the assets of the terrorist state and its associated persons in foreign jurisdictions, who promote important legislative initiatives in other states to confiscate these assets of the Russian Federation, and also advocate this in the media! We will do everything to bring home all our people who are currently in Russian captivity. The goal of restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine always goes hand in hand for us with another goal of freeing all our people who are held in Russian captivity or in prisons, as well as all those who were forcibly deported from our land. After February 24, our team managed to free 1,456 people from Russian captivity. This is significant. I am happy to see everyone who returns to Ukraine. But there is much more work ahead. However, I have no doubt that we will fulfill it together, in a united manner. Reconstruction of Ukraine after hostilities is another component of justice. It is already clear that this will be the biggest economic project of our time in Europe. The scope of what needs to be done is obvious to everyone and requires a separate enumeration now. I will mention very briefly only the key principles. The entire territory of our state needs reconstruction of those infrastructure, energy, social sphere and other objects that do not meet modern security requirements. We have to raise from the ruins the territory entered by the Russian invaders after February 24. In the same way, we will restore the normality of life in the territory of Donbas and Crimea, which were illegally occupied in 2014 and have been brought to the point of disaster by the occupiers over the time that has passed. Now it is still difficult to estimate the required amount of resources. But it can be said for sure that we should prioritize the restoration of those companies that were in Ukraine or that came to Ukraine during the war. Which left the Russian market during the war. And this is fair. Who supported us in the most difficult moments, who were with us when Ukraine was fighting for life, who worked, who paid taxes, who volunteered, who helped our indomitability... We need to find a format to give such business more opportunities in such important projects, the projects of a new, rebuilt Ukraine. Ukrainian business, American, French, Polish - any that we see - here and now. And I ask you, dear people&#x27;s deputies, together with us, together with the Office, together with the Government to develop such a legislative framework. And this will also, I think, encourage international business to enter Ukraine now - preparing for the future, for the victory. And one more thing. Just as we must restore territorial integrity, we must also restore social integrity. Millions of our people who have become displaced persons, who have found shelter abroad, should not become refugees. I thank all the countries, I thank all the nations of Europe and the world who help our people! But we must preserve them as a part of Ukrainian society. We have to ensure their return. And this includes various components of work. Security guarantees, economic growth. Reconstruction and further integration of our state with the European Union and other leading subjects of the free world. Protection of human rights, equalization of social and personal freedoms in Ukraine and in advanced countries of stay of our migrants. Creating a modern veteran policy. It’s very important! Creation of a modern rehabilitation system in Ukraine for those who were put in the most difficult position by the war. So that our society has this feeling that no one is needless among us - this is the task... That we care about all Ukrainians, that we can help each and every one of them. A country that supports every its citizen is a country that you want to return to. We have to make sure that when the world sees the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag of ours, they will know that it is about freedom and about people who have a strong home and who will always be helped - no matter what happens to them. Because we are all Ukrainians. And that&#x27;s enough. I thank you for your attention! Glory to all who fight and work for our country! Glory to all who help us protect our independence, our freedom! Glory to all of you, our people! Glory to Ukraine! I wish all of us victory and only victory in the coming year. Nothing else is needed! Happy upcoming holidays. Thank you all for this difficult year! We thank our warriors, our people of beautiful Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No matter what is happening and what is on your mind, be sure to support each other - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-28</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Today - so it turned out - is the day of summing up this year and plans for the next year. I held a meeting with officials specializing in international relations regarding events and plans for January. I met with the Minister of Defense of France who arrived in Ukraine. We discussed cooperation over the year, the reconstruction of our country and another step in strengthening our air defense. Thank you, France! I met with government officials and heads of parliamentary committees. We discussed the solutions that are being prepared. Today, I also delivered the annual Message to the Verkhovna Rada on the external and internal situation of Ukraine. About how we all - all Ukrainians - changed the world this year and what we will do next year. Probably, you could already see the highlights of all these events in the news, or you will see them. I would like to add one more thing to everything that was done and said today. Add something non-political. No matter what is happening and what is on your mind, support each other. Necessarily. Please take the time to say kind words to those close to you. Even if these are not people close to you - just to other Ukrainians. Please find an opportunity and a moment to thank for the work, to praise for this or that effort, for the care. And if a person is in such a difficult situation, at such a difficult time, remains alone and for some reason does not have relatives, please ask if he or she needs help. Or just help without even asking. If you know that a person is waiting for a son or daughter from the war, please pay attention: say hello, listen, help. Hug your family more often. Tell your friends more often how much you appreciate them. Support colleagues more often. Thank your parents more often. Rejoice with children more often. Do not forget to call when relatives are waiting, even just to hear: how are you? Do not forget to write messages to friends and acquaintances at least sometimes - you should not lose contact now. And please don&#x27;t forget to say thank you when you&#x27;ve been helped. Please try to support those who fight for our country. Our attention to others, when it may be lacking from one of our relatives - for various reasons, our words that can warm those around us when events are too cold, and our care for each other when circumstances are challenging - all this is also our common defense. We have not lost our humanity even though we have gone through terrible months. And we will not lose it even though there is also a difficult year ahead. We will reach victory. And we have to do it really together. Take care of Ukraine, appreciate each other and do everything to help our warriors! Every day - until victory. Glory to all our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every Russian missile only confirms that all this must end with a tribunal - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-29</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! First of all, I want to thank our Air Forces servicemen, Ukrainian air defense, which successfully repelled another Russian attack today. 54 missiles and 11 attack drones were shot down. Our warriors all over Ukraine distinguished themselves, and I thank all our Air Commands: Center, South, East and West. And especially we are grateful to the warriors of the 96th Kyiv, 160th Odesa, 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, whose results are the best today. Unfortunately, there were several hits. Our power engineers and repair crews are doing everything to make Ukrainians feel the consequences of the terrorists&#x27; strike as little as possible. And I thank everyone who is working to restore energy supply. As of this evening, there are power outages in most regions of Ukraine. It is especially difficult in Kyiv region and the capital, Lviv region, Odesa and the region, Kherson and the region, Vinnytsia region and Zakarpattia. But this is nothing compared to what could have happened, if it was not for our heroic anti-aircraft troops and air defense. With each such missile strike, Russia is only driving itself deeper into a dead end. They have fewer and fewer missiles. Instead, the status of the biggest terrorist in the world will have consequences for Russia and its citizens for a long time. And each missile only confirms that all this must end with a tribunal. And that is exactly what will happen. And despite all the strikes, the state works every day. The Office, the Cabinet of Ministers - everyone is working. In particular, today I had two large meetings, economic and defense. We are working to ensure that our defenders have more opportunities, more weapons, more drones. The situation on the frontline remained without significant changes over the last day. The most acute situation is in Bakhmut, Soledar, over the entire line in the Donetsk region. The enemy has not abandoned the insane idea to capture the Donetsk region... Now they set themselves a task - for the New Year. I am grateful to all our guys who have been proving to the occupiers for months that it is us who will set and achieve goals on our land. I am grateful to everyone who defends the Ukrainian Donbas! To all who defend our Kharkiv region! To all who keep our south! Who protect our border... And, by the way, I thank those border guards who, together with all the defense forces, are fighting the enemy at the front. I thank the warriors of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi and Mukachevo border guard detachments. Dear Ukrainians! There are two days left in this year. Perhaps, the enemy will try once again to make us celebrate the New Year in darkness. Perhaps, the occupiers are planning to make us suffer with the next strikes at our cities. But no matter what they plan, we know one thing about ourselves: we will endure. For sure. We will drive them out. No doubts about that. And they will face punishment for this terrible war. The maximum punishment. I thank everyone who defends our state! I thank everyone who fights for our independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In the new year Ukrainian air defense will become stronger, more effective – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-30</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I held another meeting of the Staff – already the 45th this year. The main thing is Donetsk region, Luhansk region – our Donbas, where the fiercest battles are going on. Bakhmut, Soledar, Kreminna... In general, we hold our positions. There are also areas of the front where we are slowly advancing. And I thank all our soldiers who ensure this. You are real heroes! We discussed the situation in the south, on our border, the supply of weapons, and the further strengthening of air defense. This year, we not only maintained our air defenses, but we made them stronger than ever. But in the new year Ukrainian air defense will become even stronger, even more effective. Ukrainian air defense can become the most powerful in Europe, and this will be a guarantee of security not only for our country, but also for the entire continent. After the meeting of the Staff, at a separate meeting we discussed the situation in the energy industry, what we are preparing for. We have a clear strategy for ensuring the generation and supply of electricity. It takes time to implement it. It takes a lot of effort. But it will be. It will be mandatory. It is one of the most important tasks for the next year, and I have no doubt that we will accomplish it. Today I spoke with the Prime Minister of Greece. We summarized the year, and I thanked Greece for supporting our country. We agreed for next year how we can make cooperation even more meaningful. I held a meeting with our diplomats. There are many questions, but the main thing is the measures we are preparing to strengthen Ukraine already in January and February. Ukraine will retain the achieved leadership in foreign policy and will be even more active, that&#x27;s for sure. And one more. Today, for the first time, the ceremony of awarding our volunteers with the Golden Heart took place. It is fair and honest – at the end of the year, to recognize those who help our defense, help people and our entire state all year long. Thank you to everyone who fights for our country. Who helps Ukrainians. Who works for Ukraine and our future. Glory to all our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The terrorist state won&#x27;t be forgiven, and those who give orders and carry out strikes will not receive a pardon – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-31</span></div>
  <p>December 31st... Today, this Russian missile attack is not the end of the year, no matter how much the terrorists want it. It&#x27;s the outcome of Russia&#x27;s fate. The terrorist state will not be forgiven. And those who give orders for such strikes, and those who carry them out, will not receive a pardon. To put it mildly. Several missile attack waves on New Year&#x27;s Day. Missiles against people. It&#x27;s against the people. NONhumans did it, NONhumans will lose. And you and I know it. Terrorists cannot change it. At Easter, they made such attacks, at Christmas, at New Year... They call themselves Christians, they are very proud of their Orthodoxy. But they are following the devil. They support him and are together with him. And I&#x27;ll tell you about it in Russian. All this war that you are waging, you are Russia, it is not the war with NATO, as your propagandists lie. It is not for something historical. It&#x27;s for one person to remain in power until the end of his life. And what will be with all of you, citizens of Russia, does not concern him. Your leader wants to show that he has the troops behind him and that he is ahead. But he is just hiding. He hides behind the troops, behind missiles, behind the walls of his residences and palaces. He hides behind you and burns your country and your future. No one will ever forgive you for terror. No one in the world will forgive you for this. Ukraine will never forgive. And you yourself will not forgive him everything that he will destroy and everyone whom he will kill. Citizen of Ukraine! All our services work where there were missile hits. We provide assistance to those affected. Kyiv, Khmelnytsky, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv this time... Unfortunately, there are casualties... My condolences to the families. Most of the missiles have been intercepted by our air defense forces. And these are lives saved. If it were not for air defense, the number of casualties would have been different. Much bigger. And this is yet another proof for the world that support for Ukraine must be increased. I thank all the partners who helped with the air defense. IRIS-T, Crotale, NASAMS, Hawk. MANPADS Perun, Mistral, etc. Next year it will be Patriot. This year, a lot of S-300s were made, which we also received. Each of these systems is a counter to terror, it&#x27;s what proves the strength of normal people and the ineffectiveness of terrorists. A weapon against terror is a means for peace. And every day – today is no exception – we release our people. A total of 140 people were returned from Russian captivity today. 22 officers, 118 privates and sergeants. In total, since February 24, we have returned home 1,596 Ukrainian men and women. Thanks to our team! Thanks to everyone who protects Ukraine! To everyone who is now on the front line! Thanks to everyone who fights for our country! Thanks to Air Defense Forces! And please, citizens, don&#x27;t ignore the sirens. Thanks to our energy workers - everyone who removes the consequences of terrorist attacks. It will be the New Year now. We&#x27;ll be in touch with you the whole time! We are all working. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>New Year greetings of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2022-12-31</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! This year began on February 24. Without prefaces and preludes. Sharply. Early. At 4 o&#x27;clock. It was dark. It was loud. It was hard for many and scary for some. 311 days have passed. It can still be dark, loud, and complicated for us. But we will definitely never be afraid again. And we&#x27;ll never be ashamed. It was our year. Year of Ukraine. Year of Ukrainians. We woke up on February 24. Into another life. Being another people. Another Ukrainians. The first missiles finally destroyed the labyrinth of illusions. We saw who was who. What friends and enemy are capable of, and most importantly, what we are capable of. On February 24, millions of us made a choice. Not a white flag, but a blue and yellow flag. Not escaping, but meeting. Meeting the enemy. Resisting and fighting. The explosions on February 24 stunned us. Since then we have not heard everything. And we don&#x27;t listen to everyone. We were told: you have no other option but to surrender. We say: we have no other option than to win. On February 24, we began to create our victory. From many bricks – hundreds of other victories. We have overcome the panic. We did not run away but united. We have overcome doubts, despair, and fear. We believed in ourselves and in our strength. The Armed Forces of Ukraine. Intelligence. National Guard. SBU. Special Operations Forces. Border guards. Territorial defense forces. Air defense forces. The police. The State Emergency Service. All our defense and security forces. I am proud of you all, our warriors! This year can be called a year of losses for Ukraine, for the whole of Europe, and the whole world. But it&#x27;s wrong. We shouldn&#x27;t say that. We haven&#x27;t lost anything. It was taken from us. Ukraine did not lose its sons and daughters – they were taken away by murderers. Ukrainians did not lose their homes – they were destroyed by terrorists. We did not lose our lands – they were occupied by invaders. The world did not lose peace – Russia destroyed it. This year has struck our hearts. We&#x27;ve cried out all the tears. All the prayers have been yelled. 311 days. We have something to say about every minute. But most of the words are superfluous. They are not needed. No explanations or decorations are needed. Silence is needed to hear. Pauses are needed to realize. The morning of February 24. Hostomel. Bucha. Irpin. Borodianka. Kharkiv. Mriya. Kramatorsk Station. Toy. Chernihiv. Mariupol. Drama Theater. The word &quot;Children&quot; written. Olenivka. Odesa. Multi-story building. Girl. Three months old. Vilniansk. Maternity hospital. Baby. Two days old. Azovstal. It&#x27;s impossible to forget. And it&#x27;s impossible to forgive. But it&#x27;s possible to win. We stood on our feet because there was something that kept us going. Our spirit. Defense of Kyiv. Kharkiv. Mykolaiv. Chornobayivka. Snake Island. HIMARS. Antonivsky Bridge. &quot;Cotton&quot; pops. Crimean Bridge. Neptune. Cruiser Moskva. Russian warship. Izyum, Balakliya and Kupyansk. Kherson. And we pray that there will be Kreminna and Svatove, Melitopol, all of Donbas, Crimea. We fight and will continue to fight. For the sake of the main word: &quot;victory.&quot; It will be for sure. We are approaching it for 311 days. We gave it a lot of strength. But at the moment, when it seems that you can&#x27;t go any further, remember that we have already passed with you. I want to say to all of you: Ukrainians, you are incredible! See what we have done and what we are doing! How our soldiers have been smashing this &quot;second army of the world&quot; since the first days. How our people stopped their equipment and infantry columns. How an old man used his hands to stop a tank. How a woman knocked down a drone with a jar of tomatoes. How enemy tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, shells were stolen during the occupation. How we fundraised for Shahed hunters, naval drones, armored vehicles, ambulance vehicles and Bayraktar drones in several hours. How we withstood all threats, shelling, cluster bombs, cruise missiles, darkness and cold. How we supported each other and the state. Everyone is important in war. Who holds a weapon, the steering wheel of a car, the helm of a ship or plane, a scalpel, or a pointer. Everyone who is behind a laptop, who drives a combine harvester, a train. Who is at a roadblock and a power plant. Journalists and diplomats, utility workers and rescuers. All. Who is working. Studying at a university or school. And even those who are just learning to walk. All this is for their sake. Our children. Our people. Our country. There are no small matters in a great war. There are no unnecessary ones. Each of us is a fighter. Each of us is a front. Each of us is the basis of the defense. We fight as one team – the whole country, all our regions. I admire you all. I want to thank every invincible region of Ukraine. Kharkiv. Mutilated but unconquered. You proved to the enemy that being close territorially does not mean being close in mind. Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city. The hero city. Invincible Mykolaiv. Heroically withstands all blows. The city on a wave that overcomes all storms. Sumy city and the region. You were one of the first to feel the full-scale invasion of the invaders. Sumy region became a bone in their throat for them. Ordinary people made Molotov cocktails, burned enemy columns, took the first prisoners. Sumy region is a force. Dnipro. The support and reliable rear of our front. You received people, you got the lives of wounded soldiers back. Despite constant barrages, Dnipro lives on. Odesa. Sunny and friendly, now a fortress. World fortress. Which defends us and which defends the world. Feeds it by sending millions of tonnes of salvation by sea every day. Because it is Odesa Mama. Kherson! You are heroic people! You have been under occupation for more than eight months. No news. No communication. Separated from Ukraine. Thousands of you took part in actions against the ruscists. You did not know whether we saw it in Ukraine or knew about it. The occupiers lied to you that Ukraine abandoned you and would not fight for you. But you believed and waited despite everything. The face of Kherson is cut by fragments of shells, but the main thing is that we welcome the New Year free and together under blue and yellow flags. And therefore, we will restore everything, rebuild everything. Just like Chernihiv and Zaporizhzhia, and Kramatorsk, and Bakhmut. Those that became a refuge for millions of Ukrainians: Rivne, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Vinnytsia. I thank you! Those who receive and transfer millions of tonnes of aid from Europe and the world: Lviv, Uzhgorod, Chernivtsi, Lutsk. Thank you! Those who accept the evacuation of businesses, enterprises, universities: Khmelnytsky, Zhytomyr, Kropyvnytsky, Poltava, Cherkasy. Thank you! And those who are waiting for Ukraine. And will wait. Donbas, Luhansk region, Crimea. Thanks to you, our warriors! And, of course, Kyiv region and the city are our heart, which always beats thanks to you, all our Ukrainians! We are all one family. One Ukraine. This is the year when Ukraine changed the world. And the world discovered Ukraine. We were told to surrender. We chose a counterattack! We were told to make concessions and compromises. We are joining the European Union and NATO. The world heard Ukraine. European Parliament, Bundestag, the UK Parliament, Knesset, the US Congress. The world felt Ukraine. Ukraine in the media. In the hearts of people. At the top of Google search. The world saw Ukraine. On the main squares in Toronto, New York, London, Warsaw, Florence, Sydney, and other cities. Ukrainians surprise. Ukrainians are applauded. Ukrainians inspire. Is there anything that can scare us? No. Is there anyone who can stop us? No. Because we are all together. It is what we are fighting for. One for each other. The best salute for us is at the warehouses of the occupiers. The best gift is the numbers in the report of the General Staff. We do not know for sure what the new year 2023 will bring us. But ready for anything. New achievements? We will be happy. New hits? We will be steadfast. Continuation of the fight? We will fight. And when we win, we will hug. Dear Ukrainians! A few minutes remain until the New Year. I want to wish all of us one thing – victory. And that&#x27;s the main thing. One wish for all Ukrainians. Let this year be the year of return. The return of our people. Soldiers – to their families. Prisoners – to their homes. Immigrants – to their Ukraine. Return of our lands. And the temporarily occupied will become forever free. Return to normal life. To happy moments without curfew. To earthly joys without air alerts. The return of what has been stolen from us. The childhood of our children, the peaceful old age of our parents. So that grandchildren come to visit their grandparents during the holidays. To eat watermelons in Kherson. And the cherry in Melitopol. So that our cities are free. Our friends are faithful. And so that our main figure and main success appeared in reports near the figure of 100,000 destroyed enemies, thousands of units of destroyed Russian equipment – it is 603,628 square kilometers. The area of independent Ukraine, as it was since 1991. As it will always be. May the New Year bring all this. We are ready to fight for it. That&#x27;s why each of us is here. I&#x27;m here. We are here. You are here. Everyone is here. We are all Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine! Happy New Year!</p>

  <h2>President of Ukraine: Our sense of unity and authenticity contrasts dramatically with the fear that prevails in Russia</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-01</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! New year, new day, new summaries. 45 &quot;Shaheds&quot; were shot down on the first night of the year. I thank our Air Forces - pilots, anti-aircraft warriors. 33 &quot;Shaheds&quot; are on their account. Gratitude to the air defense of our Ground Forces for another 12 downed Iranian drones. Well done, guys! Russian terrorists were pathetic, and they entered this year staying the same. Our defenders were awesome, and on January 1 they showed themselves very well. You know, these days it was clearly seen how far we have moved away, mentally, humanly from what Russia is &quot;boiling&quot; in. Our sense of unity, authenticity, life itself - all this contrasts dramatically with the fear that prevails in Russia. They are afraid. You can feel it. And they are right to be afraid. Because they are losing. Drones, missiles, anything else will not help them. Because we are together. And they are together only with fear. And they will not take away a single year from Ukraine, they will not take away our independence. We will not give them anything. I thank everyone who is fighting the enemy at the frontline every day and every night! We respond to every Russian strike at Kherson, Nikopol, Kharkiv region, all our cities and communities. It is very tangible for them. I am grateful to all our energy workers, utility workers for stable energy supply and a minimum of outages - taking into account all the existing circumstances. Wherever transmission lines and other energy facilities are damaged by shelling, the restoration continues around the clock. Today as well. And it is very important how all Ukrainians recharged their inner energy this New Year&#x27;s Eve. And how we thanked our warriors. How we thanked our loved ones. How millions of times all over Ukraine, all over the free world, our wish - the wish of victory - has sounded and still sounds. We will do everything to make it so! Glory to all our warriors! Glory to each and everyone who works for the victory of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Now everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive - President&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-02</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Only two days have passed since the beginning of the year, and the number of Iranian drones shot down over Ukraine is already more than eighty. This number may increase in the near future. Because these weeks the nights can be quite restless. We have information that Russia is planning a prolonged attack with &quot;Shaheds&quot;. Its bet may be on exhaustion. On exhaustion of our people, our air defense, our energy sector. But we must ensure - and we will do everything for this - that this goal of terrorists fails like all the others. Today, I would like to mention the Air Commands &quot;Center&quot;, &quot;South&quot; and &quot;East&quot; for the successful protection of the sky these days. And especially - the warriors of the 96th Kyiv, 208th Kherson and 138th Dnipro anti-aircraft missile brigades, the 301st Nikopol anti-aircraft missile regiment of the Air Forces, as well as the warriors of the 39th anti-aircraft missile regiment of the Ground Forces. Of course, I am grateful to our pilots, the pilots of our fighters and warriors of mobile firing groups. Now is the time when everyone involved in the protection of the sky should be especially attentive. The Russian regime needs mobilizing emotions. Something that they want to demonstrate to their country in order to continue lying that everything is going &quot;according to the plan&quot;. And our task is to give Ukraine every day successes, achievements, even small, yet victories over terrorists and terror. Each shot down drone, each shot down missile, each day with electricity for our people and minimal schedules of blackouts are exactly such victories. And every step forward of our servicemen at the front, every saved position is such successes that are of strategic importance now. We must increase the price of new mobilization and war in general for the terrorist state as much as possible. I am grateful to every warrior of ours who ensures this! I am grateful to everyone who stands near Bakhmut! I am grateful to everyone who despite everything holds positions in Soledar and other areas! Thank you for the Luhansk region, for the south! No matter how difficult it is now, we must endure it. For it to be easier at the end of this winter. Today I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. I am glad that the first international conversation in the new year was held with the head of the European Commission. We equally understand the challenges of this winter, this year for Ukraine and the whole of Europe. We have discussed financial support for our state - in January, we expect the first tranche of macro-financial aid, as was agreed upon last year. This is extremely important right now, when Russia is trying to gather new forces for aggression. We have also discussed the preparation of the Ukraine-EU Summit to be held in early February. I believe that at this summit, we will be able to outline the key new steps for this year for our common resilience, for our common victory. Today, I held a special preparatory meeting with members of the NSDC and representatives of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada and the Office on global trends for Ukraine this year and in the future. I instructed to elaborate draft decisions of the NSDC for the internal transformation of our state to continue and for us to ensure security and leadership of Ukraine under any external conditions. I am grateful to everyone who will be on duty at combat posts tonight! I am grateful to all who are fighting for our native Ukraine! I am grateful to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must disrupt the Russian scenario, the terrorists must lose - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-03</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! I have just finished a conversation with the Prime Minister of Canada, and this is the fourth international conversation today. The Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister of Norway. And now Justin Trudeau. We started this year with what Ukraine needs most right now - on the eve of new mobilization processes being prepared by the terrorist state. Now is the moment when together with our partners we must strengthen our defense. We have no doubt that the current masters of Russia will throw everything they have left and everyone they can muster to try to turn the tide of the war and at least postpone their defeat. We have to disrupt this Russian scenario. We are preparing for this. The terrorists must lose. Any attempt at their new offensive must fail. This will be the final defeat of the terrorist state. I thank all partners who understand this. Russia mobilizes those whom it wants to throw to death, we mobilize the civilized world. For the sake of life. I am grateful to Canada for its unwavering defense, sanction and financial support. Today we discussed with Prime Minister Trudeau how we can further increase pressure on Russia. I feel that Canadian assistance to our defense will remain strong this year. I thank Norway for the very powerful decisions that have already been taken and that are still being prepared. This applies to armed support as well - Norway&#x27;s role can become truly historic in the defense of Europe if we implement everything we are talking about now. This also applies to the support of our energy system. In particular, I thank Norway for its readiness to help provide Ukraine with the necessary volume of gas for this winter. I am grateful to the UK for the fully concrete agreements reached, first of all in the defense sphere. Today, in the conversation with Prime Minister Sunak, I felt that we equally perceive the importance of this year, the prospects of this year. The fact that it is possible to achieve a pivotal advantage right now, not allowing Russia to win back on this or that front direction. I am grateful to the Netherlands for sharing with us the same understanding of justice, of how this war should end. Today I have informed Mr. Prime Minister Rutte on the nearest intentions of the enemy, on what Russia is preparing for the winter months and the beginning of spring. I am confident that Ukraine will be heard in Europe. And every day I will continue such diplomatic activity - both formal and informal, both public and non-public. This morning, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. A long one. There were reports from the Commander-in-Chief on the operational situation at the front, the head of intelligence - on what to expect from the enemy in the coming weeks and months. We determine the needs of Ukraine, our defense, our energy sector in great detail. And we are working to meet each of the needs, in particular with partners. And one more thing. Yesterday Russian terrorists destroyed the ice arena in Druzhkivka, Donetsk region. With a missile. This ice arena - &quot;Altair&quot; - started working before the war, when Donbas had a normal life before Russia came. Children trained there. There was a children&#x27;s sports school. Hockey competitions were held there. People played sports there, celebrated and just enjoyed life. Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka, Bakhmut, Pokrovsk, Donetsk, Toretsk and other cities and villages of Donbas - everyone knew what kind of arena it was, and many people visited it. Last year it was used to collect and distribute humanitarian aid. The Russian missile against Altair in Druzhkivka is another confession of the terrorist state. It is a confession of what it came to Donbas with and what we will definitely oust from there. Death will not prevail in Donbas, and we must do everything to throw out its tricolor from Donbas and other lands of Ukraine. I thank everyone who fights and works for our victory! I thank everyone who helps protect life! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>President: We must put an end to the Russian aggression this year exactly</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-04</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have new and powerful results from our diplomatic marathon. France takes European defense support for Ukraine to a new level, and I thank President Macron for this leadership. We will receive more armored vehicles, in particular wheeled tanks of French production. This is what sends a clear signal to all our other partners: there is no rational reason why Ukraine has not yet been supplied with Western-type tanks. And this is very important to restore security for all Ukrainians and peace for all Europeans. Before the new &quot;Ramstein&quot; such signal is extremely relevant. We must put an end to the Russian aggression this year exactly and not postpone any of the defensive capabilities that can speed up the defeat of the terrorist state. Modern Western armored vehicles, Western-type tanks are just one of these key capabilities. I want to thank Denmark today after the conversation with Prime Minister Frederiksen. I informed her of the current situation on the frontline, that Russia is planning another wave of aggression for the coming months. We must make this wave the last one - no chance for revenge for terrorists. Today, I have heard strong support for Ukraine from Denmark, readiness to strengthen our positions in the fight against aggression together. And it is very important that this year Denmark will defend the security and interests of Europe and international law just as after February 24. I had a conversation with the President of Romania today. It was a meaningful and multifaceted conversation. I thanked Mr. President for the level of cooperation we achieved last year. This applies to political, defense and economic cooperation as well. We have done a lot together to protect the Black Sea region. I am confident that this year we will do even more. As I have already said, I will continue such diplomatic activity every day - this marathon of negotiations with the leaders of partner states and friends of Ukraine around the world. We are already responding and will respond very concretely and effectively to any new attempt of the aggressor to additionally mobilize and throw something more against Ukraine. Exactly with what is necessary on the battlefield and for the protection of the entire territory of our state. Each of our partners will have very specific information about our defense needs. And we all have the same goal: to put an end to Russian aggression as soon as possible, to restore reliable and lasting peace. We are discussing our initiative - our Peace Formula - with all leaders. These are ten clear points. All security elements, our territorial integrity, complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine and full guarantee of justice, that is, punishment of all those guilty of this aggression and crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians, as well as compensation for all damages caused to Ukraine at the expense of the assets of the terrorist state. Today, I would like to praise our warriors in the Bakhmut direction, in particular, the special unit of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine &quot;Shaman&quot;, as well as the border guards of the Luhansk detachment, who, together with the fighters of the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine, inflict numerous losses to the enemy and drive the occupants out of their positions on the outskirts of Bakhmut. This is a good result, and I am grateful for it. Each such result and each day of the enemy&#x27;s failures in the Bakhmut direction and in Donbas in general is a significant weakening of the aggressor state. The occupants have been postponing the date when they expect to capture the entire Donbas for six months. They have been expecting to do it by the New Year - and our defenders are demonstrating success again. The invaders are constantly increasing their forces in the Donetsk region - they are doing it now as well. And every such day with our successes is a new proof of the insanity of the very idea to attack Ukraine. If only such news from the front can return a sense of reality to everyone in Russia, we will have to ensure it as much as possible. And we must understand how difficult and painful this task is. But it cannot be otherwise. Terrorists must lose despite everything they try to do to strengthen themselves. I am grateful to our defenders of the Bakhmut fortress! I am grateful to all our warriors who withstand the pressure in the Soledar direction and defend their positions! I am grateful, of course, to all our fighters who provide quite encouraging news from the Luhansk region and certain southern areas of our country! Thank you to all who fight for Ukraine! Thank you to all who help us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The war will be over when Russian soldiers either leave or we drive them out - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-05</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Today was another active diplomatic day - four more leaders of partner states were fully informed about Ukraine&#x27;s defense needs and the nearest plans of the terrorist state. Russia will not be able to conceal in silence its preparations for a new wave of aggression against Ukraine and the whole of Europe. The world will know in all details - how and when the aggressor is preparing a new escalation in this war. And every new mobilization step of Russia will be known to the world even before Russia makes it. We will ensure this. And we strengthen the defense of Ukraine every day. I always discuss two things with all leaders - more defense support for our state, that is, more weapons for our army, and more protection for all Ukrainians - protection on the ground, in the sky and at sea. My conversation with Prime Minister of Croatia Plenković today was not only meaningful, as always, but also quite inspiring. I heard the full support for our state, as well as the readiness of Croatia to be a leader in the implementation of those steps that guarantee the return of security elements to Ukraine and Europe in general. Croatia is ready to be a leader in those efforts that are necessary to clear our land from Russian mines and unexploded shells. This is one of the vital tasks for our country and all Europeans. No part of Europe should be - and will not be - contaminated with mines, no matter how hard Russia tries to fill our land with its instruments of death. My today&#x27;s conversation with the President of Latvia was also devoted to the path that our entire continent must take to ensure truly reliable security after the defeat of Russian aggression. We discussed the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula - security, restoration of our territorial integrity and full force of the UN Charter, as well as the fair responsibility of Russia and all its murderers for the terror against Ukrainians. I would also like to mention the conversation with President of Türkiye Erdoğan - it concerned many elements of security in our Black Sea region. Of course, we talked about the necessary steps to ensure food security and what needs to be done for nuclear safety and prevention of any radiation incidents, the threat of which Russia has made, unfortunately, quite real. We also talked about the dynamics of the situation in our region - about the fact that the masters of Russia are now in a rather desperate situation due to the defeats of the occupiers at the front and are ready for various manipulations. I am grateful to President Erdoğan for supporting our state and the necessity of fair restoration of the security of Ukraine and the whole of Europe based on the restoration of our territorial integrity. My conversation with Prime Minister of Spain Sánchez was very meaningful and timely. On the eve of the new meeting in the Ramstein format, it is very important for each of our partners to know 100% the real situation on the frontline and what our Defense Forces are ready for. I thank Mr. Prime Minister Sánchez and all Spaniards for their unwavering support of our commitment to defend freedom. And today I would like to express separate gratitude to President Biden and Chancellor Scholz for the decision to strengthen our defense, a very important decision. We will have another Patriot battery and powerful armored vehicles - this is truly a great victory for our country. All details and terms will be announced tomorrow - after my conversation with Mr. Chancellor. Today, I also held a meeting of the Staff devoted primarily to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our defense and security forces. We understand that we must use the nearest time - January and the beginning of February - to be ready for any attempts of terrorists to use new mobilization resources of Russia. Today, I would like to commend our fighters of the 54th separate mechanized brigade who have been successfully holding positions in the Bakhmut direction for many months. And also - the fighters of the 35th marine brigade for the gradual, step by step liberation of our territories in the Donetsk direction. Thank you, warriors! I am grateful to each and everyone who provides us with the much needed resilience and progress in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions! And one more thing I want to remind the citizens of Russia today. On November 15, the Ukrainian Peace Formula was presented. One of its points provides for the withdrawal of Russian occupation troops from the territory of our country. This is a guaranteed and reliable way to cease fire, stop casualties and war in general. As of the morning of the same day, the number of Russian soldiers killed was 82,000. On December 12, Russia received an offer to begin implementation of the Peace Formula with the withdrawal of occupation troops just on Christmas Day. As of that day already, the number of Russian soldiers killed was almost 95,000. Apparently both of our proposals have not been heard by the leaders of your country... In the place where they are, apparently, it is too deep to hear. As of today, you have already lost almost 110,000 of your soldiers killed in this war. Those who continued the terror against our country and sent all those people of yours to the slaughter, rejecting our offers to stop the Russian aggression, certainly do not value life and definitely do not seek peace. Now they want to use Christmas as a cover to at least briefly stop the advance of our guys in Donbas and bring equipment, ammunition and mobilized men closer to our positions. What will this bring? Just another increase in the death toll. Everyone in the world knows how the Kremlin uses respites at war to continue the war with renewed vigor. But to end the war faster, that is not what is needed at all. What is needed is the citizens of Russia who will find the courage to free themselves of their shameful fear of one man in the Kremlin, at least for 36 hours, at least at Christmas time. Your fear of him destroys your country, which is also already deep... But not in a bunker. To end the war is to end your state&#x27;s aggression. Even when your missiles and drones are not hitting our cities, the terror in the occupied territories continues. You don&#x27;t give Ukrainians any respite. People are tortured, electrocuted, raped. This continues every day while your soldiers are on our soil. And the war will be over when your soldiers either leave or we drive them out. So, let them take the toilet bowls - they&#x27;ll need them on the road - and go back home. Behind our border of 1991. I thank everyone who helps our people defend freedom! I thank everyone who fights and works to defeat terrorists! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>President&#x27;s greetings on Christmas</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-06</span></div>
  <p>Dear people! My sincere congratulations to millions of Ukrainian families who gather together today to spend Christmas Eve and meet the first star. It announces the birth of Christ. This is a holiday of harmony and family unity. And together we are all a big Ukrainian family. And no matter where we are now - at home, at work, in a trench, on the road, in Ukraine or abroad - our family is united as never before. In its courage, steadfastness, mutual respect and mutual assistance. United in its belief in a single victory. We are bringing it closer together. Every day. Together we stand for each other, side by side. Every day. We protect our land, our culture, our traditions, our faith. As our ancestors Cossacks did - defenders of faith and the Church of Christ. And as it was done by all their descendants and successors of the traditions of our army and our people. Our ancestors believed that on Christmas Eve the souls of deceased relatives descend from heaven. As it is sung, to see those who were left on earth. Today the spirits of our ancestors help us every day. To fight those who came to our land. We live in special times. And all our holidays are special. And we have to break some of our traditions to protect our traditions. On holidays, you cannot wear dark or old, worn clothes so that trouble does not come to your home. But trouble came to our home on February 24, 2022, so since then we are not in white clothes and we are fighting against black forces. Guests should be treated with special friendliness and care. Guests, not occupiers. It is forbidden to clean and take out the garbage from the house on a holy day, but we’ve been fighting against devils and taking out the garbage from our house for more than 300 days in a row. It is forbidden to sew and knit, but we weave camouflage nets and sew bulletproof vests, overcoming evil. Our ancestors did not go hunting these days, but we fight so that we do not become prey and defeat the beast. God sees it. The world sees it. &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot;, written to the music of Mykola Leontovych, is sung in more than 150 variations. Ukrainian &quot;Shchedryk&quot; brings Christmas spirit to the whole planet. The spirit of hope, goodness and miracle. This year, this spirit is brought to the world not only by our music, but also by Ukrainian courage, indomitability and invincibility. Our ancestors believed that heavens open on Christmas night. And if at this time you ask the higher powers about your dream, it will certainly come true. Today we all have one dream. May harmony come to every family, welfare to every home, victory to the Ukrainian land, and with it – peace and prosperity for thousands of years. I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a delicious kutia! Take care of yourself, take care of your families, take care of our Ukraine! Christ is being Born! Glorify Him!</p>

  <h2>We&#x27;ve managed to bring Ukraine&#x27;s strength, defense cooperation with partners to new level – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-06</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Finally, we can say that we have managed to bring Ukraine&#x27;s strength and defense cooperation with partners to a new level. The one we really need right now. Now, our soldiers will have even more weapons, equipment, rounds, defense systems, which will make us much more prepared for any escalating plans of Russia and those strikes that the terrorist state inflicts, regardless of whether it is a holiday or a weekday. I thank everyone who helps us protect our country and Ukrainians! Since I visited the United States two weeks ago, there have already been more than 20 stages in our diplomatic marathon. It&#x27;s my communication with the leaders of Germany, Sweden, Japan, Croatia, Spain, Latvia, Turkey, France, Denmark, Romania, Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Israel, Greece and India. In addition, my first negotiations this year with the President of the European Commission. Also constant contact with US representatives. For example, today a delegation of the Senate was in Kyiv, and also a conversation between the defense minister of Ukraine and the secretary of defense of the United States was held. And today, a new package of US defense assistance for our country was announced – and a very powerful one! For the first time, we will get Bradley fighting vehicles – this is exactly what is needed. New guns and projectiles, including high-precision ones. New missiles. New drones. It&#x27;s timely and strong. The total amount of this support package from the United States is almost $3 billion. I thank President Biden, I thank the congressmen and all Americans who value freedom, and who know that freedom is worth protecting, and who heard Ukraine during my visit to Washington. We see absolutely concrete results of this visit and our negotiations. We now have a significant step forward by Germany to strengthen the security of not only Ukraine but also the whole of Europe, especially the entire region bordering Russia. Strengthening our air defenses is a direct de-escalation effort here and now. The fewer opportunities Russia has to terrorize peaceful cities, the less the overall potential of Russian aggression will be. I thank Chancellor Scholz for the decision to provide Ukraine with the Patriot air defense system! Together with the brilliant German IRIS-T, the Patriot system will make Ukrainian and European skies much safer. Also today, with Mr. Chancellor, we discussed other aspects of our defense cooperation, in particular, 40 Marder vehicles and other things that are necessary to stop Russian aggression. A very important talk was held today with Prime Minister of Japan Kishida. Last year, Japan became a leader among Asian countries in the protection of freedom and international law. I am sure that this year too – especially with Japan&#x27;s chairmanship of the Group of Seven, which began in January – we will be able to do even more together for our common security. Actually, today we agreed on priorities for cooperation this year. And I thank Mr. Prime Minister for a very serious package of energy assistance – powerful generators for our country and people. Today&#x27;s conversation with the Prime Minister of Sweden can also be called strategic. The Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union has now begun, and we expect to begin negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union during the Swedish presidency. It&#x27;s an important motivational element for Ukraine and all Europeans. Despite any attempts by Russia to destabilize Europe, together we become even stronger in all aspects, including institutional ones. So, as of now, for Ukraine, there is more air defense, more armored vehicles, for the first time – Western tanks, more guns and rounds, more energy and political opportunities. And all this means more protection for Ukrainians and all Europeans from any manifestations of Russian terror. Ruscism must lose this war – in everything and everywhere. On land, in the sky, on the sea, in energy, in the economy, in politics, and finally – on the dock in the international tribunal for this aggression against Ukraine. Every day, together with our partners, we bring this sentence for terrorists closer. Peace is getting closer every day. I will continue our diplomatic marathon next week. Let&#x27;s make Ukraine even stronger! I thank everyone who defends our country! Thanks to everyone who keeps Bakhmut and Donetsk region! To everyone who is moving forward in Luhansk region! To all who hold the south! To all who defend our sky! Dear Ukrainians! Please remember what evil is at war against us. Pay attention to the air raid alerts, and especially during these holidays. Our air defense fighters will do everything possible. But please help them by taking care of your own safety. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It&#x27;s very important that sincere prayer for Ukraine was today and will continue to be heard in Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-07</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Once again, I wish everyone who celebrates today, on this day, which has already become historic for Ukraine, for the spiritual independence of our people, a Merry Christmas. I was glad today to see how many people, how many of our soldiers attended the service in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra – in that holy place, which is one of the origins of the Ukrainian cultural tradition. It&#x27;s very important that a sincere prayer for Ukraine was today and will continue to be heard in the Lavra. And that no one will make Ukrainian a stranger in the laurel. Ukrainian independence must be strong in all its elements. And it will be like that. Forever. We&#x27;re bringing it ourselves. And it&#x27;s very important to continue staying in the mood that was felt today. The joy of strengthening Ukraine and achieving historical justice. I wish all Ukrainian men and women that you and I have this mood more often. Today, I signed the decrees on the implementation of the decisions of the National Security and Defense Council – a new meeting was held. First, we approved the general action plan of the National Security and Defense Council for this year. It will certainly be no less forceful than in previous years, and the key priority is to ensure our independence and strengthen our ability to defend ourselves – making all the steps required, using all the means that will work. Secondly, we have an intermediate result in the work regarding many citizens of Russia and persons associated with it who justify the war, help to wage it, or glorify the terrorist state. Today, there is the first such sanctions list – there will be further decisions on sanctions against such persons. Everyone whose voice sounds in unison with the roar of Russian artillery will be isolated from the civilized world. And, by the way, the world was once again able to see today how false any words of any level that sound from Moscow are. They said something there about an alleged ceasefire… But the reality is that Russian rounds hit Bakhmut and other Ukrainian positions again. It has been confirmed once again: only the expulsion of the Russian occupiers from Ukrainian land and the elimination of any opportunities for Russia to put pressure on Ukraine and the whole of Europe will mean the restoration of the ceasefire, security and peace. It&#x27;s what we are working for, it&#x27;s exactly what the help of our partners is aimed at, and it&#x27;s exactly what the entire civilized world has now. And I thank everyone who helps us defend the independence of Ukraine! Thanks to everyone who fights and works for our country! Today we are one step closer to our victory. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Resilience and efficiency of actions at the front in general depend on resilience and efficiency of actions at each point of the front - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-08</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, the first liberation of our warriors from Russian captivity took place this year. 50 Ukrainians returned home. 33 officers, 17 - privates and sergeants. Among them are defenders of the Kyiv and Donetsk regions, Mariupol and the south of the country. Soldiers of the army, National Guard, territorial defense, navy, border guards. Our team works without a single break to free Ukrainians. Today I want to thank them once again: Budanov, Yermak, Malyuk, Usov, Lubinets and others. I am especially grateful to those of our units who replenish the exchange fund. Everyone who captures the enemy on our land, gives an opportunity to return freedom to some Ukrainians. I would also like to note the success of our Air Forces. Since the beginning of this day, three helicopters and also drones have been shot down. Well done, guys! Thank you for the consistent demilitarization of the aggressor state. The situation on the frontline has not changed significantly in the first week of the year. Heavy fighting continues in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - every hotspot in these areas is well known. Bakhmut is holding out against all odds. And although most of the city is destroyed by Russian strikes, our warriors repel constant attempts at Russian offensive there. Soledar is holding out. Although there is even more destruction there and it is extremely hard... There is no such piece of land near these two cities, where the occupier would not have given his life for the crazy ideas of the masters of the Russian regime. This is one of the bloodiest places on the frontline. Today, commander of the direction, General Syrskyi, visited the troops defending the outskirts of Bakhmut and Soledar. He awarded the warriors for their resilience. On the spot, he organized the steps necessary to strengthen our defense. In particular, transfer of additional units. And intensification of fire on the invaders. We should understand that all our positions, all our actions in defense are interconnected, and the resilience and effectiveness of actions at the front in general depends on the resilience and effectiveness of actions at each point of the front. I thank all our defenders who act in this way, who realize that their personal resilience, their personal strength and effectiveness give resilience, strength and effectiveness to the whole state. We defend the whole state, wherever the battles for it take place. We are preparing for diplomatic events that we have planned for this week. We expect good news for our country, good decisions that will further strengthen the defense. The world has seen again these days that Russia lies even when it draws attention to the situation at the front with its own statements. Russian shelling of Kherson with incendiary ammunition right after Christmas. Strikes on Kramatorsk and other cities of Donbas - exactly on civilian objects and exactly when Moscow reported on the alleged &quot;silence&quot; of their army. More threats of Russian officials to Europe and the world… All this was when Moscow was talking about the alleged &quot;truce&quot;. No attempt by Russia to manipulate diplomacy and politics will ever work again. Only the strengthening of Ukraine, only the successes of Ukraine, only the restoration of territorial integrity of Ukraine, only the return of all our people from Russian captivity are the guarantees of peace. We are bringing it closer every day. Glory to all who fight and work for the victory of our state! Glory to all who help our state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for our state and our independence! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Due to the resilience of our warriors in Soledar, we have gained additional time and power for Ukraine - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-09</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Today, I have held a regular meeting of the Staff. The main attention was paid to the situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - those areas that are the hottest now. Bakhmut and Soledar, Kreminna and Svatove, overall prospects in Donbas for the coming weeks. The battle for Donbas continues. And although the invaders have now concentrated their greatest efforts on Soledar, the result of this difficult and long battle will be the liberation of our entire Donbas. I thank all our warriors who defend our Bakhmut and demonstrate maximum resilience! I thank all the warriors in Soledar who withstand new and even tougher attacks of the occupiers! It is extremely difficult - there are almost no whole walls left... Due to the resilience of our warriors there, in Soledar, we have gained additional time and additional power for Ukraine. And what did Russia want to gain there? Everything is completely destroyed, there is almost no life left. And thousands of their people were lost: the whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes. This is what madness looks like. I thank all our defenders for every step forward in other areas on the frontline, for gradual advancement - very careful, calculated and therefore absolutely reliable. Today, the Commander-in-Chief, commanders, chief of intelligence reported to the Staff... We integrate into our defense system new combat means and equipment that we receive from our partners. We do everything to ensure that there is as little time as possible between the agreement on additional support and the application of this support on the battlefield. Today, I held four more stages of negotiations with partners - we continue our diplomatic marathon, which began last year with a visit to Washington. During this day - Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, President of Slovenia, Prime Minister of Portugal, Prime Minister of North Macedonia. I spoke to all of them about the increase of defense support for our state, the necessity to bring Russian aggression to defeat this year and the implementation of all elements of our peace formula - from the restoration of territorial integrity of Ukraine to the punishment of terrorists for their actions. There will be good news for our state, and it is very important that we reach an agreement with our partners right now, on the eve of the new &quot;Ramstein&quot;, and against the background of new brutal crimes of the occupiers. Russian strikes on Kherson and Ochakiv, cities of the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, constant terror against border communities of the Sumy region... Constant terror against our people in the occupied territory... The world knows that every day of Russian presence on Ukrainian soil means deaths, injuries, pain and suffering of people. Ukraine must get everything it needs to expel terrorists from our land and to reliably protect our people from any Russian escalation plans. I am sure that our warriors will have these weapons and equipment at the front. Very soon. Today, I met with the Executive Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the European Green Deal - for the renewal of European energy life on the basis of modern &quot;green&quot; energy. Such renewal is our goal as well, and it is a security goal. Modern and &quot;green&quot; energy for Ukraine, the use of renewable energy sources will significantly strengthen our resilience against any aggressive ambitions of Russia aimed at our and European energy sector. We are also preparing for important events in our political relations with the European Union - for the EU-Ukraine Summit, for further institutional rapprochement of our state, our state system and the EU system, as well as for the beginning of membership negotiations. This is one of our most important tasks. I am grateful to everyone who brings the implementation of this task closer with their work. I thank each and everyone who helps our country! Glory to everyone who works for the victory of Ukrainians! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Tonight, I have signed decrees awarding our warriors. 573 warriors were awarded state awards. 283 of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to each and every one who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Free world has everything necessary to stop Russian aggression; it is important for global democracy - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-10</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is a new stage of our diplomatic marathon. Four more conversations with European leaders: President of the European Council, Prime Minister of Belgium, President of Estonia and Prime Minister of Ireland. I informed them about the situation on the battlefield - about the difficult situation in the Donetsk region, about the constant Russian attacks and the fact that Russia does not count its people, does not spare the locals and does not stop before any criminal actions. This can - and must! - be countered only by a new level of modern military equipment that Ukraine can receive from partners. I thank all the leaders who help us for understanding that now is the time for new powerful decisions, for new powerful support. The free world has everything necessary to stop Russian aggression and bring the terrorist state to a historic defeat. And it is important not only for us. It is important for global democracy, for all those who value freedom. It is even more important now, when Russia is gathering forces for another escalation. Together with our partners, we must do - and we are doing! - everything to make it clear to Russia&#x27;s masters that no escalation will help them. The defeat of the Russian aggression must remain unalterable, no matter who and what Russia tries to throw into the battle. I am grateful to the President of the European Council for understanding how important it is to maintain the unwavering support of Ukraine. In this confrontation, in which Russia is trying to exhaust all of us - Ukrainians, Europeans, other partners - there must be clarity of signals. Signals that we will go all the way to the defeat of Russian terror. We will go together and with the preservation of stability in Ukraine - financial and social. And that is why financial support was one of the main topics of my conversation with Charles Michel, as well as weapons and further European integration of Ukraine. I thank the Prime Minister of Belgium for supporting our diplomatic efforts, in particular our Peace Formula, all its fundamental elements: restoration of security, restoration of our territorial integrity, restoration of justice. I am confident that the leadership of Belgium will help us achieve a fair peace. And I am thankful for the willingness to really bring peace closer by increasing the armed support for our state. The already provided Belgian defense assistance has significantly strengthened our state, and we agreed today that our teams would work on a new supply. I am grateful to the President of Estonia and all Estonians for new decisions to strengthen our defense. We have also discussed with Mr. President our further steps in the European and Euro-Atlantic integration. I thank Estonia for a very strong representation of Ukraine&#x27;s interests in Europe. Even when someone doubts, Estonia finds arguments to support Ukraine and to increase sanction pressure on Russia. I am grateful to the new Prime Minister of Ireland for the willingness to continue the course of Ireland&#x27;s comprehensive support for Ukraine. We have agreed on a powerful energy support. And I thanked Ireland for freezing Russian assets - we will work together to ensure that these funds are used for the restoration of Ukraine. In general, since my visit to Washington, I have already held about thirty talks with leaders and representatives of partner states. And I literally feel every day how the world&#x27;s determination to overcome Russian aggression is growing. I thank everyone who helps us defend Ukraine and freedom! I thank everyone who fights for independence! Today, I would like to pay special tribute to the warriors of the 46th separate airmobile brigade for their bravery and steadfastness in the defense of Soledar! Thank you, warriors! I thank everyone who works to strengthen Ukraine! And one more thing. Based on the materials prepared by the Security Service of Ukraine and the State Migration Service of Ukraine, and in accordance with the Constitution of our state, I have decided to terminate the citizenship of four persons: Andriy Leonidovych Derkach, Taras Romanovych Kozak, Renat Raveliyovych Kuzmin and Viktor Volodymyrovych Medvedchuk. If people&#x27;s deputies choose to serve not the people of Ukraine, but the murderers who came to Ukraine, our actions will be appropriate. And these are not the last such decisions. The services are working. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania together will go all the way to restore security of our state and the whole of Europe - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-11</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Today, here in Lviv, important news for Ukraine was announced during the Summit of the Lublin Triangle, our special format with Poland and Lithuania. Poland has decided to provide tanks for Ukraine - I am grateful for this. I thank President Duda, the Government of Poland, all our Polish friends. Lithuania provides anti-aircraft systems to our country - the weapons we need to protect ourselves from Iranian drones - to protect our energy sector. I thank Gitanas for another demonstration of unwavering and principled support for Ukraine, which began even before February 24 and will continue until our victory. Today, I heard this confidence once again from both Andrzej and Gitanas - we will go all the way together to restore security of Ukraine and the whole of Europe, to restore our territorial integrity, to restore peace. Russian aggression must fail - and it will. Today, we have discussed the issue of our integration into the EU and NATO in a very meaningful way. This year, we must achieve tangible progress in European integration. This concerns, first of all, the start of negotiations on membership. Poland and Lithuania are equally and comprehensively ready to support us, see us fully integrated into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Together with our other partners on the continent and in the Alliance, we have to transform this readiness, this energy into real institutional movement, into real decisions. Of course, today we also talked about the situation on the battlefield. In particular, that Russian aggression will be depleted only when Russian ambitions have no other alternative except for the defeat. All Russian ambitions - on the front, in politics, in economy, in the legal sphere. Now the terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that some part of our city of Soledar - a city that was almost completely destroyed by the occupiers - is allegedly some kind of Russia’s achievement. They will present – and are already presenting – this to their society in such a way as to support mobilization and to give hope to those who support aggression. But the fighting continues. The Donetsk direction is holding out. And we do everything, without stopping for a single day, to strengthen Ukrainian defense. Our potential is growing. And I thank all our partners who help in this. Western-type tanks are the work of our entire anti-war coalition and this is a new level of our potential. Today, in Lviv, I also held a meeting on the security situation in our western regions and on our state border. We take into account all threats, strengthen all elements of the security of our regions. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! I thank everyone who works for our victory! I thank everyone who helps us restore security! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The day will definitely come when the Ukrainian flag will be on par with all flags of the EU member states - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-12</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. The meeting, which by its nature corresponded to the situation on the frontline, in the most important directions. Of course, the top issue is Soledar, Bakhmut, the struggle for the Donetsk direction in general. We have analyzed in detail what decisions are needed, what reinforcements are needed, what steps should be taken by commanders in the coming days. We also discussed the situation with the supply of weapons and ammunition to the troops, relevant interaction with our partners. Today, I talked about the prospects of the coming weeks and months with the Speaker of the Latvian Saeima, who was on a visit to Kyiv. We discussed not only defense, but also political prospects. In particular, European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine. I heard confidence that the day will definitely come when the Ukrainian flag will be absolutely on par with all flags of the EU member states. Latvia will help us in this. By the way, Latvia is one of those countries whose support for Ukraine in terms of percentage of GDP is one of the largest over the past year. I think that this trend may continue this year. Today, I continued phone talks with the leaders of the partner-states. Two more European countries whose voice is extremely important for Ukraine are Cyprus and Luxembourg. We are also expanding the geography of the diplomatic marathon - I spoke today with Mr. President of Kenya. All these negotiations are devoted to the security issues of both our state and our partners. I am grateful for the support of the Ukrainian Peace Formula and for the willingness to work together with us to put an end to Russian aggression as soon as possible. A very important initiative of Ukraine is the creation of food hubs in Africa. Our foreign policy should reach a new level with African partners. They have already felt that the security of different nations directly depends on Ukrainian food exports. And we want to consolidate this at the level of specific institutions, specific objects - hubs, that is, specific guarantees of food stability that will be constantly in effect and will be one of the new foundations of relations between Ukraine and the states of the African continent. Today we also opened a new direction in our state charity platform United24. This direction is the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is the generation of funds for the restoration, in particular, of housing for Ukrainians in the territories affected by Russian strikes and occupation. As of this day, about half a billion hryvnias have already been raised through United24 from people from more than a hundred countries to restore housing. This is a tangible help to both local communities and the state. In general, more than 10 billion hryvnias have already been raised due to the state fundraising platform. And I thank everyone who joined the United24 fundraising. Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! Thank you to each and everyone who fights for Ukraine! And today, I want to especially mention the paratroopers of the 77th separate airmobile brigade, who together with the fighters of the 46th separate airmobile brigade in Soledar hold their positions and inflict significant losses on the enemy. Thank you, guys! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine at the solemn session of the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania on the occasion of the Day of Freedom Defenders and the ceremony of awarding the Freedom Prize of the Republic of Lithuania </h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-13</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much! Dear friends! Gitanas, Mr. President! Madam First Lady Diana! Madam Speaker! Madam Prime Minister! Mrs. Paulė Kuzmickienė, thank you very much for your words! Ladies and gentlemen deputies of the Seimas! All attendees! Dear Lithuanian people! I am glad to greet you and I want to thank you at once for not betraying freedom for a single minute. And not only during these 323 days of cruel, inhuman Russian war - when we constantly feel your support. But for many years - when the free hearts of Lithuanians and the Lithuanian path to a united Europe inspired many people in different countries once enslaved by Russia. Lithuania is and, I am sure, will continue to be one of the most sincere defenders of freedom. And this is the best way to honor the memory and feat of the heroes who defeated the empire on those winter days 32 years ago. Your people did not just defend the buildings of the TV center, parliament and others. You defended your historical choice. Now we are also heading to victory. To the final victory over that empire. Russia will no longer be able to dictate anything to the peoples of Europe when we end this war with the unequivocal defeat of the aggressor. Remember February last year. Remember the offensive of Russian troops on Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv. It was much more than Russia&#x27;s attempt to seize our territory. Encroaching on our cities, they meant the cities of other independent states of Europe as well. Attacking Kyiv, they dreamed of attacking Vilnius. And Riga, and Warsaw, and Prague, and Chișinău. They wanted our freedom to fall. But it is they who will fall. And now they have less and less such dreams. They are losing the power they boasted about. They are only talking about whether they will manage not to lose. However, this is not enough. We must make sure that no aggressor will ever have the opportunity to dream of something similar and encroach on our freedom. This is what we are fighting for. This is why our victory must be unequivocal now. The one that cannot be confused with anything. The one that will not be forgotten in Russia. The one that cannot be manipulated. The aggressor must be defeated. On the Ukrainian land where he came. So that it won’t be necessary to fight on the lands of other European nations later. And now - so that Russia does not get a break, does not have time to adapt and cannot restore its strength. This year is crucial. Back then, when your people had to defend their national life against Soviet revenge, it was impossible to protract it in time. It was necessary to act here, to act now - to defend yourselves. Your people have done so. Lithuanian hearts were fully mobilized. And this was the key to your victory at that time. Now we need even greater mobilization - in the whole free world. This is the only way to put an end to full-scale aggression. Total terror. The energy of the struggling world must not diminish. And I thank you for being ready to help us with this. I am sure, and I was convinced of this the day before yesterday when I spoke with Gitanas, with Mr. President, in Lviv. We need urgent decisions by our entire anti-war coalition. New defensive decisions that will give Ukrainian warriors the opportunity to drive the Russian army out of our land. And this concerns, first of all, modern tanks and effective artillery. We need new sanction decisions that will maintain constant and irresistible pressure on the aggressor state and on all economic actors that ensure the continuation of aggression. And we need an international tribunal, which will bring to justice those whose evil minds gave birth to this crime, this war. When the revanchists from present-day Moscow will face a fair trial, it will be a historic punishment for those revanchists who tried to break our freedom a generation ago. Dear friends! This day - Freedom Defenders Day - is the right time to remind that freedom is alive when the idea of its protection is alive. When there are people willing to fight for it. And when it is not just rhetoric, but real actions. Actions that Ukraine sees from Lithuania invariably. Actions that help us liberate our cities and villages from Russian occupation. Actions that help us protect our people from Russian missiles and bombs - I want to thank you, Gitanas, I thank you and the entire Lithuanian people for the air defense equipment provided to us - from the first day to this day. And also these are actions that bring closer the full integration of Ukraine and the institutions of the United, free, peaceful Europe. And we are looking forward to the NATO Summit in Vilnius. We know that it can become fateful for our entire Euro-Atlantic community. We will do everything to make it so. And we will do it together! Because history is always the achievement of the free. Thank you, friends! Thank you for this honorary award for all Ukrainians who are fighting for freedom! I believe that we will win! I know that we will win! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This week we managed to significantly strengthen resoluteness of our partners to increase supply of weapons to Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-13</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Several more stages of our diplomatic marathon took place today. I spoke with Mrs. Čaputová, the President of Slovakia. About details of our defense cooperation and the diplomatic steps we have planned with the Europeans for the near future. Thank you to Slovakia for supporting the interests of Ukraine and the whole of Europe. I also held talks with the Prime Minister of Albania, Rama. As always, I heard an understanding of our needs, an understanding of the Ukrainian position. In general, thanks to the negotiations this week, we managed to significantly strengthen the resoluteness of our partners to increase the supply of weapons to Ukraine. And we are working as hard as possible to ensure that it&#x27;s reflected in the decisions of the next meeting at Ramstein Air Base, the meeting of defense ministers, which will take place in the second half of January. We are also preparing for Ukraine&#x27;s participation in the events of the World Economic Forum in Davos. This year, the traditional economic topics of the forum will obviously give way to security issues. And it&#x27;s important for us that there is an effective and clear Ukrainian answer to every question of the world regarding security. So be it. I took part in a special solemn meeting of the Lithuanian Seimas. Lithuania celebrated the Day of the Defenders of Freedom – the anniversary of the events of January 1991, when people defended the independence of their state against the efforts of then Moscow to maintain control over Lithuania. And today there was a very symbolic meeting, very emotional. I thanked our Lithuanian brothers for all their actions in support of Ukraine and our struggle for freedom and for all their words about the heroism of our people, which were and will be heard in Lithuania. Today, one of our greatest achievements in the time since February 24 was very clearly felt, namely: the context of European freedom, the context of the integrity of the European Union is simply impossible to imagine now without Ukraine. The fullness of Europe is, in particular, the fullness of integration with Ukraine. We will do everything to implement it in concrete decisions of the European community. Of course, today, as every day, we are constantly in touch with our commanders, with the heads of intelligence and special services. The tough battle for Donetsk region continues, the battle for Bakhmut and Soledar, for Kreminna, for other towns and villages in the east of our country continues. Although the enemy has concentrated its greatest forces in this direction, our troops – the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all defense and security forces – are defending the state. I thank every soldier, sergeant, officer of brigades and other army units who are bravely and staunchly performing their tasks! I thank the fighters of the Kraken unit for their decisive actions to destroy the enemy near Soledar! Thanks to the soldiers of the International Legion of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense and the Shaman unit, who are bravely defending Bakhmut! Three hundred twenty-four days of the full-scale war, and how things have changed for Russia... They are already gnawing among themselves over who should be credited with some tactical advance. It&#x27;s a clear signal of failure for the enemy. And it&#x27;s another incentive for all of us to put more pressure on the occupier and to inflict heavier losses on the enemy. Thanks to everyone who makes it happen both on the front lines and all our other fronts. That is why today I also want to mark the employees of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Those whose work is usually completely invisible. And about whom few people talk. But they really bring closer very important decisions of partners for Ukraine, for our defenders. Thanks for that! I thank all the personnel of the Security Service of Ukraine, whose results in the fight, in particular, against collaborators and saboteurs, society sees. Every step of the state in national defense is carefully prepared, and this gives us legal and fair results. This gives us a real increase in our independence, in all its aspects. Thank you for that! Thanks to everyone who works for the victory of our country! Glory to our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must do everything to stop ruscism in the same way that the free world once stopped Nazism – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-14</span></div>
  <p>I will begin this address without a greeting. And I want to be heard by those people – not only political leaders – who are still hesitating whether it is worth providing Ukraine with the weapons that will help us defeat the terrorist state this year. Russia has launched another heavy missile attack on Ukrainian cities. Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kryvy Rih, Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Ladyzhyn, Burshtyn, Lviv region, Khmelnytsky and other cities were targets of terrorists. Civilian objects are everywhere! In the city of Dnipro, a residential building has been destroyed in this Russian strike. An ordinary nine-story panel building, of which there are quite a few in various cities of Eastern and Central Europe. All floors of this building – from the second to the ninth – were smashed in the explosion of a Russian missile. It was possible to save dozens of people – wounded, traumatized, treatment is being provided to them. Among them are children, the youngest girl is three years old. And these are figures for now. Debris clearance is still ongoing and will continue throughout the night. It&#x27;s not yet known how many people are under the rubble. Unfortunately, the death toll is growing every hour... My condolences to relatives and friends Can Russian terror be stopped? Yes. Is it possible to do it somehow differently than on the battlefield in Ukraine? Unfortunately no. This can and must be done on our land, in our sky, in our sea. What is needed for this? Those weapons that are in the warehouses of our partners and that our troops are so waiting for. No amount of persuasion or just passing the time will stop the terrorists who are methodically killing our people with missiles, drones bought in Iran, their own artillery, tanks and mortars. The whole world knows what can stop and how it&#x27;s possible to stop those who sow death. This apartment block in Dnipro was on a street called Naberezhna Peremohy. When they gave this name to this street, they had in mind the victory over the Nazis in the Second World War. Ruscists took over everything from that enemy of the free world. It&#x27;s obvious. And we must do everything we can to stop ruscism, just as the free world once stopped Nazism. And I thank everyone who helps us in this! I spoke today with the Prime Minister of the UK about some very important things for our defense. Details will come later. But it&#x27;s important. It&#x27;s really what is needed. And I believe that similar decisions will still be made by other partners – those who understand why such evil cannot be given a single chance. Because such evil knows no boundaries. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by ruscism! Glory to all who defend people! All services are now working in the sites hit by Russian missiles. Let&#x27;s fight for every person! Out of more than 30 missiles launched towards Ukraine during the day, more than 20 were shot down. These are hundreds of saved lives. I thank our Air Force, our airmen and everyone who helps. Unfortunately, energy infrastructure facilities have been also hit. In this regard, the most difficult situation is in Kharkiv region and Kyiv region. Repair crews are doing their best to restore power generation and supply as soon as possible, and work will continue around the clock. And the enemy will receive our answer on the battlefield for sure. Our soldiers will do that. Anyone involved in this and other missile strikes against Ukraine will be found and brought to justice. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Everyone will be held to account for terror: both those who kill and those who help to kill - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-15</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today I have been receiving reports from Dnipro all day. The debris is being cleared there. All necessary services are involved. Thanks to everyone who is carrying out the rescue operation! I thank the State Emergency Service, the police and the National Guard. I want to thank the utility services, our doctors, all volunteers, ordinary citizens of Dnipro who are helping! As of now, the fate of more than 30 people who could have been in the house at the time of the terrorists&#x27; missile hit remains unknown. Dozens of people were rescued from the rubble, including six children. We are fighting for every person! The rescue operation will last as long as there is even the slightest chance to save lives. Currently, the list of the dead includes 30 people, including one child - a girl, she was 15 years old. There are reports that two children lost their parents. My condolences to all those who lost their loved ones... Since the attack, Ukraine has heard words of condolences and support from many leaders, public figures, journalists and ordinary people from around the world. I thank everyone who did not remain indifferent! It is very important that normal people unite in response to terror. But... I want to say to all those in Russia - and from Russia - who even now could not utter even a few words of condemnation of this terror... Even though they see and know everything perfectly well… Your cowardly silence, your attempt to &quot;wait out&quot; what is happening will only end with those same terrorists coming after you one day. Evil is very sensitive to cowardice. Evil always remembers those who fear it or try to bargain with it. And when it comes after you, there will be no one to protect you. I think it is right that today there is a decision to expand our sanctions against Russian citizens and other persons who help terror. Almost 200 - this list is carefully prepared, and behind each name there is a responsible motivation. Those who justify terror. Those who grease the Russian propaganda machine. Those who tried to sell Ukraine somewhere in Moscow. This public will face a full list of personal restrictions. We will do everything to make the sanctions work on the largest possible scale - in Europe, in the world. Everyone will be held to account for terror: both those who kill and those who help to kill. The work of the NSDC on the sanctions lists continues, and the next decisions will be made soon. Today, as always, I want to thank our warriors. All those who heroically and steadfastly perform combat missions. Those who hold our positions. And especially in the most difficult areas of the front. The battle for Soledar, for Bakhmut, for the whole Donetsk region, for the Luhansk region continues without any respite, without any stop. I am grateful to each of our fighters, each of our soldiers, sergeants, officers who understand how important it is to destroy the invaders in this direction. Russia has made the battle for the cities of our Donbas fundamental for itself. Our heroes make this battle fundamental for the destruction of the combat potential of the terrorist state. Every day of Ukrainian resilience in Donbas and every success in our defense there are vital achievements for the protection of our entire state. And one more thing. Today a great friend of Ukraine, a legend - Vakhtang Kikabidze - passed away. We can talk a lot about him, and still there are not enough words to say all the good things that are worth saying about him. It is an honor for us that he was our friend. May his memory be bright! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We work every day and night to reduce the enemy&#x27;s potential - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-16</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! The debris of the house destroyed by the Russian missile is still being dismantled in Dnipro. I thank everyone who is carrying out this rescue operation! Every employee of the State Emergency Service and police, every doctor, every volunteer! Everyone who is involved! As of now, 39 people, including 6 children, have been rescued from under the rubble. In total, 47 reports were received about those who could have been in the house at the time of the strike and whose fate was unknown. The information about 22 people has been clarified. It is known about 40 dead, including 3 children. My condolences to all whose loved ones were killed by this strike! The Security Service of Ukraine has already started to gather information about those Russian military who prepared and carried out this strike. There is no doubt: every person guilty of this war crime will be identified and brought to justice. This strike at Dnipro, as well as other similar strikes, falls, in particular, under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. And we will use all available opportunities - both national and international - to ensure that all Russian murderers, everyone who gives and executes orders on missile terror against our people, face legal sentences. And to ensure that they serve their punishment. This is a fundamental task for Ukraine and for our partners. I thank everyone who supports our country on the path to justice. Today, by the way, I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte - he is one of those who help Ukraine the most, particularly in the issue of justice. It was our third conversation with Mr. Prime Minister in four weeks. I am grateful to Mark and all Dutch people for their continued support and clear understanding that Ukrainians must defeat Russian aggression. Today we discussed protection against Russian missiles and Iranian drones - we are doing everything to strengthen our air defense as much as possible. It is very important that our conversation took place on the eve of the visit of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands to the United States. What happened in Dnipro, the fact that Russia is preparing a new attempt to seize the initiative in the war, the fact that the nature of hostilities at the front requires new decisions in the defense supply - all this only emphasizes how important it is to coordinate our efforts - efforts of all members of the coalition to defend Ukraine and freedom. And to speed up decision-making. Today, there is a good example from the UK. A new package of defense assistance has been announced - exactly what we need. Tanks, other armored vehicles, artillery. What we discussed with Prime Minister Sunak. I thank you, Rishi, I thank every Briton for the tangible and timely support! I held a regular meeting of the Staff. The questions are as follows. Interaction with our partners. Counteraction to missile terror. Possible scenarios of enemy actions and our response to each of the probable scenarios. There were reports of commanders, intelligence chiefs. There were also necessary decisions. The situation in the Donetsk direction was considered separately and in detail. Soledar, Bakhmut and other cities against which Russia has concentrated its last most prepared forces. We also reviewed the situation on the southern front. We see what Russia is preparing. Every day and night we work to reduce the enemy&#x27;s potential: every day and night we subtract their warehouses, headquarters, communications. Today, the OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Macedonia visited Kyiv. Of course, we discussed first of all how to make the OSCE effective. This is one of those international organizations that have significant potential, but for various reasons in critical situations have a great lack of concrete actions, a great lack of determination. The OSCE can significantly increase attention and act accordingly regarding the deportation of our people from the occupied territory to Russia. And regarding the situation with Ukrainian prisoners. No international organization has found the strength to gain access to the places of detention of our prisoners in Russia yet. This must be corrected. I hope that the OSCE presidency of North Macedonia will contribute to this. Starting tomorrow, this week will be even more active in terms of our diplomacy. The Davos Forum will start its work - Ukraine will be heard at this globally important platform. At the end of the week, a regular meeting in the Ramstein format will be held. We expect fundamental decisions from the coalition of our partners. Important bilateral negotiations are also planned. Every day of our diplomatic marathon brings Ukraine quite specific defensive results. And I thank everyone who helps our state! I thank everyone who works for the victory of Ukraine! Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to all who have been fighting since February 24 and since 2014! This week, on January 20, we will mark the Day of Honoring the Defenders of the Donetsk airport. Today we have already started to recall that defense, that heroism of our people. The fight started in May 2014. The last defender left the DAP on January 23, 2015. And it was such a defense that the whole world should have seen back then already what Ukrainian invincibility means. I am confident that the Ukrainian flag will return to the Donetsk airport, Donetsk and other cities and villages of our Donbas and other temporarily occupied territories. Temporarily is the key word. Ukraine will return its people and what belongs to it. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We can restore peace throughout Ukraine, but for this we must be together - speech of Volodymyr Zelenskyy during an online meeting with German students</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear friends! I am grateful to you for those kind words about our people, our students and for everything that Germany does to support our country. Now the attention of many Ukrainians is focused on what is happening in our city of Dnipro. You have just spoken about it. A few hours ago, the rescue operation on the ruins of a house that was destroyed by a Russian missile was completed there. An ordinary residential building. Destroyed by an anti-ship missile - an aircraft carrier killer, which was developed back in the days of the Soviet Union. 44 people were killed. Including 4 children. Yesterday, a woman was rescued from the rubble - she spent 20 hours under the concrete, under the fallen slabs. She survived. But she lost her family... Her husband and child - a boy, he was only 11 months old - he could not be saved. And this is an unspeakable horror. And this is a routine. Unfortunately, this is the routine of the war that Russia brought to our land. Ukrainian cities and villages are subjected to such and similar attacks every day. Every day the news from the south of our country is about Russian indiscriminate shelling of the city of Kherson. Every day - shelling of the cities of Donbas and the east of Ukraine. Every day, the terror of border communities - those areas that are unlucky enough to border with Russia - they are shelled with mortars and artillery. I want you to understand Ukrainians - to understand what we are fighting against. We want to interrupt the routine of war. And restore the routine of peace. But we can do it only by winning the war. There is no other way. Most of you present here are very young people. You did not see the time when the Soviet rulers controlled a huge European space. In particular, part of Germany. However, the memory of that time - of how the Soviet empire existed and how it collapsed - is quite well worked out by historians and publicists. People know what happened. When the past is known, there is always a temptation to project that past onto the present. Especially when it comes to the actions of the same entity - the Kremlin. We have seen the attempts to integrate Moscow into the economic interdependence with Europe in the same way as it was done in the 1970s - 1980s of the XX century. Unfortunately, relations with Russia&#x27;s neighbors have been viewed by some European politicians through the Russian optics for too long. For many years, the policy of European states - not all, but those with the greatest influence - has been based on the principle of caution towards Russian ambitions and dialogue with Russia - no matter what. This became political fertilizer for the audacity of Russian imperialism. For the confidence of the current master of the Kremlin that Europeans are allegedly weak. And that the missile legacy of the Soviet authorities allegedly outweighs international law, democracy, the strategic goal to unite Europe, namely the need to guarantee peace on our continent. Russia was wrong in its assessment of Ukraine and the whole of Europe. We haven&#x27;t been taken aback. We have united. We have shown that Russia will never again control the European space and dictate to people how to live and what to value. Russia does not admit the mistake - and continues the war. But this is always the case with dictators. Democracies are stronger. Democracies can say that some previous policy was wrong. And that changes are needed. This is exactly what is happening now in Europe - in particular, thanks to German leadership. I am grateful to Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his determination to admit that the past is over. This Kremlin is not capable of being a partner in any variations of détente. It is impossible to coexist with it. Because it is impossible to coexist with terror. That is why Germany is becoming one of the leaders in supporting Ukraine - and we greatly appreciate it. We appreciate the assistance of your state both in protecting our skies from Russian missiles and in protecting social stability for our people. We appreciate the fact that German policy is being freed from Russian optics in relation to Ukraine and other countries-neighbors of Russia. But the page of European history, on which the Russian belief in the weakness of Europe is based, has not yet been turned. There is still a feeling in Moscow that it is possible to use threats or bribery to persuade European states to take the decisions Russia expects. I am sure that this page of history will be turned forever when we will be able to liberate our cities and villages from Russian terrorists with the help of German &quot;Leopards&quot;, &quot;Marders&quot;, &quot;Gepards&quot;. This will be the time when Europe will be finally liberated from imperialism. It will be one decision - and how much fidelity to principles will be in it! Perhaps it will be the greatest in the history of Europe after the fall of the Soviet empire. Dear friends! I would like you to draw one conclusion from my words now. Exactly as students, as young people. As those who have to bring novelty to life, to your chosen professions. And this conclusion is to never be afraid to change the optics. To never be hostage to something that has become obsolete. To remain free, we must always rediscover what freedom is. To be strong, we must always see what mistakes were made. And to maintain leadership, we must always admit the reality. The Ukrainian reality now is that we can win this war. By the way, just today I spoke about this with Federal President Steinmeier. We can restore peace on our entire territory without leaving any pieces of land to the Kremlin for further experiments on people and history. But for this we must all be together - Ukraine, Germany and the whole free world. I believe that we will! Thank you for your attention! And I want to thank all university communities that are with us today! Thank you to all students and lecturers! Thank you - Madam President Professor von Blumenthal, and you - Madam President Professor Kocher! And special thank you to those who help the Ukrainian community in Germany and our students who study at your universities! I am waiting for your questions. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world hears Ukraine in Davos and knows what Russia has done to Dnipro and other territories it brought death to - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-17</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! Today the rescue operation in Dnipro has been completed. 79 people were wounded or injured by this Russian strike. The list of the dead includes 45 Ukrainians, including 6 children, including a boy who was only 11 months old… Children and civilians are enemies for Russia. Obviously, this could only happen because Russia has turned into an enemy of all mankind. I thank each and every person in the world who helps us to defend ourselves against terror! Today we heard very important news from Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. The news is actually a continuation of our recent negotiations with him. Ukraine will be provided with another Patriot battery. Thank you, Mark! That is, we already have three guaranteed batteries. But this is only the beginning. We are working on new decisions to strengthen our air defense. Today, I discussed defense cooperation with Federal President of Germany Steinmeier. We are actively preparing for a new meeting in the Ramstein format. We are preparing new important diplomatic steps - we also discussed them today. The annual forum in Davos, traditionally a powerful global political and economic platform, has started today. The world hears Ukraine in Davos - they know what Russia has done to Dnipro, they know what terrorists are doing to Kherson, Kharkiv, our Donbas and other territories Russia brought death to. And we are lobbying for increased global pressure on the terrorist state. I am confident that following this week, the world will see more active and influential supporters of the establishment of a Tribunal for Russian aggression and a special mechanism to compensate for the losses from the war at the expense of Russian assets. It is very important that the First Lady of Ukraine presented all the elements of our Peace Formula in Davos today, including the fundamental clause on justice, which envisages full liability of Russian terrorists for everything they have done. And the world&#x27;s support for our diplomatic initiative is very much felt. We are doing everything to ensure that this support becomes truly global and that steps to end Russian aggression and return security are taken by all influential actors in international relations. Today, I held a meeting with the participation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine to identify the culprits of the attack on Dnipro. Every day there is more and more factual information and legal steps of our state. And all this will end with sentences for all these Russian murderers. I want to thank all the employees of the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies and all our partners, our intelligence, all special services that are working on the necessary materials for trials against rashists. I would like to thank all volunteers, public figures, especially journalists who are helping the investigation. And, of course, I thank all our warriors, each and every one of them who defends the state as part of all our defense and security forces, who is doing everything to oust the Russian army from Ukraine. First of all, I thank the warriors who are now at the front, who are fighting for our freedom, who are true heroes! When we oust the occupiers from our land, it will be a matter of time when justice will return, when sentences for Russian murderers will be pronounced. Glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian aggression. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Mobilization of the world must outpace the next military mobilization of our joint enemy - address by the President of Ukraine at “Restoring Security and Peace” session during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-18</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and gentlemen! Ten hours ago a tragedy happened near Kyiv. The helicopter crash claimed lives of the Minister of the Internal Affairs of Ukraine, his colleagues and helicopter crew when it fell near a kindergarten. Fourteen Ukrainian families lost their loved-ones today. And many more families are losing daily because of the war. And I shall ask you to honor the memory of every person Ukraine has lost with a minute of silence. Only one minute but it keeps the memory of so many people. Ukraine lives thousands of such minutes including three minutes on January 14. Three minutes – the time it took for the Russian missile to travel hundreds of kilometers, hit a residential block in Dnipro and kill at least forty-five people. My address will be short – about the time we are short of. About small minutes, about years made of these minutes. Three years ago, I spoke at Davos for the first time. In person. The topic was how to build a cohesive and sustainable world. I am talking online now. And the topic is how to cooperate in a divided, fragmented world. Conclusions? They are obvious: the world cannot keep the pace with changes and challenges. The list of crises – global security, environmental, food and energy ones – needs to be amended with another one: the time crisis. The list of calls for decisive, efficient joint actions needs to be expanded with one more: the call for speed. The speed of decision-making. Reaction of the civilized world. Tragedies are outpacing life. The tyranny is outpacing the democracy. Russia needed less than one second to start the war. The world needed days to react with first sanctions. The time the free world uses to think is used by the terrorist state to kill. Ukraine and its allies have been resisting it for almost a year. This period proved all our prompt actions brought positive results: the opening of European borders for Ukrainians; the grain deal; the energy unity. Together they saved millions of lives, not only in Ukraine. It is not only Ukraine – but the whole world needs exactly this pace of decisions and actions. The world was hesitant in 2014 when Russia without hesitation occupied Crimea. The world was hesitant in 2022 when Russia without hesitation made the war full-scale. The world must not hesitate today and ever. When the evil seeks revanche, the world needs resolve and speed. Russia is exporting terror. Russia is spreading the strain of war across the world. Ukraine offers the world a Peace formula. Please.Ten steps that the world must make faster than Russia makes its new moves. Mobilization of the world must outpace the next military mobilization of our joint enemy. The supplying of Ukraine with air defense systems must outpace Russia’s next missile attacks. The supplies of Western tanks must outpace another invasion of Russian tanks. The restoration of security and peace in Ukraine must outpace Russia’s attack on security and peace in other countries. A tribunal for military crimes must prevent new ones. The expansion of NATO and the EU must outgo the spread of Russian aggression. We routinely defend values which some of the allies take for granted – as a fact of life. For us, the fact of life is the world in need of resolute and prompt steps. Ladies and gentlemen! Three years ago was my first time at the WEF. It was the time when the world was fighting Covid-19. It fought and won. Now the world is fighting against Putin. In three years, we will be discussing new challenges and threats in Davos. What will this mean? It will mean we will definitely overcome the current threat. The history repeats itself. At first, the world either fails to notice or underestimates a threat. Then it unites to resist it. And then the world wins. Every time the same outcome. The world overcame nazism, the apartheid, pandemics, the indifference to climate changes, financial crises, and the Kremlin strain. The world will overcome again. This is how much can be said in a matter of minutes. This is how much can be understood in a matter of minutes. The world will overcome again. The time is high to make it happen faster. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I thank everyone who was involved in the rescue operation in Brovary today - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-18</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Another day of this terrible war, these tragedies that our people are going through, is coming to an end. A terrible day that we must go through, must endure. And we will endure. The rescue operation lasted almost nine hours in Brovary, Kyiv region, on the scene of the crash of a SES helicopter. Hundreds of people were involved in extinguishing the fire, searching and rescuing the injured, carrying out the initial investigative actions. Our rescuers, police officers, National Guard soldiers, doctors, psychologists, employees of the Security Service of Ukraine. I thank everyone involved in this rescue operation today. I would like to thank the educators of the kindergarten on the territory of which the helicopter crashed. Mrs. Ruslana, Mrs. Olena, Mrs. Tamara, Mrs. Kateryna and all the employees of the kindergarten - I thank you! Thank you for your bold actions, for taking the children out. I would also like to thank the ordinary residents of Brovary, in particular Mrs. Diana, Mrs. Nadiya and others who helped both the children and the wounded. I am grateful to Hlib and Andriy, the guys who also kept self-control and helped. 25 people were injured, including 11 children. 14 people were killed, including one child. My condolences to all those who lost their loved ones! The Security Service of Ukraine has initiated a criminal investigation into this terrible event. I have instructed the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, in cooperation with all other authorized bodies, to clarify all the circumstances of the crash. Today, all the necessary decisions were made regarding the management of the Ministry of Internal Affairs system. We have lost people who were professionals, patriots and reliable managers. Minister Denys Monastyrskyi, Yevhen Yenin, and their colleagues who died in the crash are not people who can be easily replaced. It is a truly great loss for the state. My condolences to the families. The Ministry will be temporarily headed by the Head of the National Police of Ukraine. The tasks for which the Minister was responsible in the context of our defense operation and ensuring the security of the state have also been distributed. The border, the situation in the frontline area, the participation of the National Guard and the police in the fighting are under control. As soon as clear facts are established as to what exactly led to the crash, we will provide this information. Today, as always, we have been in touch with our military all day long. The situation at the front remains difficult, with the epicenter of the most fierce and principled battles in Donbas. We notice a gradual increase in the number of shelling occasions and attempts at offensive actions by the occupiers. I am grateful to all our warriors who are holding their positions! I thank the warriors of the 68th separate hunting brigade and the 36th separate marine brigade for hitting the enemy very effectively and for the resilience we need in Donbas! I also thank the units of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine for the actions that reduce the chances of the occupiers. Today it was announced that Canada is preparing a powerful defense assistance package for Ukraine. In particular, it will include armored vehicles. This is very timely and significant. I thank Canada for its continued support and for the fact that we are preparing together for Russia&#x27;s attempt to intensify its attacks. No one in the world today will remain unaware of the plans of the terrorist state. I took part in the Davos Forum. The message from Ukraine is very simple and honest: no one in the free world has the opportunity to dawdle now. I know that in the near future there will be new and really necessary steps in support of our defense. We will do our best to ensure that there are as many such steps as necessary to defeat the terrorists. Glory to all our warriors! Eternal memory to all Ukrainians who died because of the war unleashed by Russia! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia must be held to account for every Ukrainian family killed, for every burned Ukrainian city and village, we have to restore justice - address by the President of Ukraine to the attendees of the Russian War Crimes exhibition in Davos</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-19</span></div>
  <p>There must be justice. When there is no justice, all guidelines in life disappear, except for the simplest ones - except for the desire to survive and take revenge. The revenge for all the evil committed when the enemy destroyed justice. Ukraine did not start this war. This is an unprovoked and brutal aggression with one aim - to destroy our nation and get rich on everything taken away from our country. The scale of the Russian crimes on the Ukrainian soil leaves no doubt - this was the plan of the Russian leadership. These are the terms of the invasion they agreed to. All this terror, killings, torture, looting. Wherever Russian troops entered Ukrainian territory, professional Russian torturers came with them. People are electrocuted, raped, shot in the limbs, starved to death, left without water and sleep... The burial of tortured people in the occupied territory - in the yards of houses, in the forests, on the roadside - is a companion of the Russian state flag. This is the way chosen by this state. The way of the terrorist. The way of the torturer. The way of the murderer. The way of the looter. This is Russia&#x27;s state choice, and there should come state responsibility. Russia must be brought to justice for every burned Ukrainian city and village. For every destroyed life. For every Ukrainian family killed by Russian missiles, bombs and mines. We must bring back justice. We can bring back justice. We must punish evil. The International Criminal Court has the jurisdiction to prosecute Russian war criminals. The International Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression of Russia against Ukraine will have the jurisdiction to bring to justice the highest officials of the Russian politics and army who launched this war of aggression. The special compensation mechanism will have the power to compensate Ukraine and every person affected by Russian aggression for the damage done by Russia. Compensation should be covered by Russia&#x27;s assets and all those associated with it. This terrorist war of Russia against Ukraine should be the last such war. Never again should any other state step on such a path of terror. The revenge will not do it. That is why justice is needed. And I thank everyone who helps us on this path to justice! I thank everyone who helps us to save people and protect our country! Life will win. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The key task of our state and our partners is to intensify Russia&#x27;s feeling that it will not achieve anything in Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-19</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A few hours ago, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. New members of the meeting were involved. In particular, Acting Minister of Internal Affairs, Head of the National Police of Ukraine Ihor Klymenko. He is in control of everything that depends on the Ministry of Internal Affairs system in terms of our defense and security. The heads of some regional military administrations also took part in the meeting of the Staff today to report on the implementation of the law on national resistance. These are the Volyn, Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa regional military administrations. I think the reason for such geography is clear. Every element of our defense, including territorial defense, must be properly organized. Of course, the Commander-in-Chief and the commander of the hottest operational direction at the front - Khortytsia - reported to the Staff. We are taking appropriate steps to strengthen our units in the battle for Donbas. By the way, today I would like to celebrate the successes of the border guards of the Luhansk and Kramatorsk detachments, who, together with other warriors of the defense and security forces, are fighting in the Donetsk direction, defending Bakhmut. Thank you, guys, for your resilience and ability to inflict such losses on the enemy that gradually make the occupiers&#x27; attacks meaningless! I also thank the warriors of the Dozor special unit of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine for effectively deterring the enemy! Now the key task of our state, all of us and our partners is to increase the feeling of the terrorist state every day that they will not be able to achieve anything in Ukraine. No matter how much time they spend on the war. No matter how much effort they expend and how many of their people the Kremlin&#x27;s masters throw on the battlefield. The fulfillment of this task consists of various elements, both defense and political. But one of the most important elements is tanks. Modern Western tanks, on the supply of which we are negotiating with our partners. And I thank all those who have already made the relevant decisions. I thank Mr. Charles Michel, President of the European Council, who was in Kyiv today and who very clearly calls on Europe to make a decision on tanks. And the relevant coalition of partners has actually already been formed, and now we are waiting for a decision from one European capital that will activate the prepared chains of cooperation on tanks. I believe that the strength of German leadership will remain unchanged. Today, speaking in the Verkhovna Rada, Charles Michel once again made it absolutely clear that there are no alternatives to the common future of Ukraine and the European Union. &quot;Without an independent and secure Ukraine, there can be no independent and secure Europe. Without a free Ukraine, there can be no free Europe. We have a common future&quot;. This is what Mr. President of the European Council said, and this can be the motto of our relations and our integration processes this year. We are preparing the next Ukraine-EU Summit, which is scheduled for early February. We are also preparing for the start of negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union - there are all the prerequisites for these negotiations to start this year. Today I met with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. We have an important agreement, and it is already being implemented: IAEA missions will be sent to our nuclear power plants. To all of them. This will significantly increase the safety of our nuclear generation. We also discussed the situation around Zaporizhzhia NPP and steps that can restore radiation safety to all humanity, which was violated by Russia. I had a conversation with the President of the United Arab Emirates. I noted the level of cooperation achieved and thanked for the support in the UN. I informed Mr. President about the opportunities that will be opened by the implementation of our Peace Formula and the components of the formula that we can implement together. And I am grateful for the support of these efforts of Ukraine. And today we have several powerful decisions by our partners to strengthen our defense. First of all, in strengthening our artillery. I am grateful to Estonia for another and the largest package of military aid from this country. For howitzers and ammunition. I am grateful to Sweden for the new military package. For NLAW, Archers and IFVs. I am grateful to Denmark for adopting the decision on CAESARs for our warriors. This will significantly strengthen our army. I am grateful to Lithuania for the new military package. For anti-aircraft systems, ammunition and helicopters. And we are preparing for tomorrow&#x27;s Ramstein - we expect powerful decisions. We expect a powerful military support package from the United States. Thank you to everyone who defends freedom with us! Glory to all our warriors who show resilience and give Ukraine the results it needs! Glory to everyone who works for the victory! And my congratulations to all those who celebrate the Epiphany, the Baptism of the Lord today. May the power of our faith speed up the purification of our land from Russian evil. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is in your power to make a Ramstein of tanks - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s speech at the meeting of the Advisory Group on Defense of Ukraine in the &quot;Ramstein&quot; format</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-20</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear participants of the victory makers coalition! I am grateful to you for the achieved unity! For this dialogue and cooperation format. We see the results on the battlefield in Ukraine. Thank you. On the battlefield against our common enemy. And I believe that our unity will only become stronger with every new Ramstein. But do we have a lot of time? No. Terror does not allow for discussion. The terror, which burns city after city, becomes insolent when it feels that the defenders of freedom run out of weapons against it. The war started by Russia does not allow delays. And I can thank you hundreds of times and it will be absolutely just and fair, given all that we have already done, – but hundreds of &quot;thank you” are not hundreds of tanks. All of us can use thousands of words in discussions, but I cannot put words instead of guns that are needed against Russian artillery, or instead of the anti-aircraft missiles that are needed to protect people from Russian airstrikes. I am truly grateful to all of you for the weapons you have provided – every unit! – helps to save our people from terror, but time remains a Russian weapon. We have to speed up! Time must become our common weapon, just like air defense and artillery, armored vehicles and tanks, which we are negotiating about with you. And which, actually, will make the victory. Ladies and Gentlemen! This is the first time I am addressing you in such a format. And I am addressing you not as Ministers of military warehouses, but as Ministers of defense. Defense of everything that makes our world free. Civilized. I am addressing you – those who serve the values of freedom and who remember the world your parents dreamed of for you. I am addressing you – those who themselves dream of a certain world for their children. It is the time now to protect those dreams. This is the future. I am sure you do not want to allow such a world order, where hatred will rule. Your parents would not want that kind of world for you. You would not want such a world for your children. But this is exactly such a world order that Russia seeks for all of us. Not only for Ukraine! But for the whole world! Russia wants the power to destroy nations. And they talk openly about it in Moscow. Russia wants to destroy law and universal human values. And the Russian troops, by their actions, on the territory of Ukraine, are fighting just for this. In order to teach the world to hate. Russia is concentrating its forces, last forces, trying to convince everyone that hatred can be stronger than the world. That is why you and I have to speed up. We have to do it. We must act as fast as a father or mother, who saves their child. As a son or daughter who sees that their parents need immediate help. It is about what kind of world people will live in. People who dream, love and hope. They hope that the freedom will be protected – for Ukraine, for all of Europe, for each and every coalition’s country. It is about people who believe that evil and hatred will always lose. The Kremlin must lose. Ladies and Gentlemen! You are strong people of powerful countries. And I know your bravery. And I appreciate everything you have done and are doing now. I encourage you to make such decisions that can deprive Russian evil of any power. You can start this policy today. It is in your power to make a Ramstein of tanks. Not to bargain about different numbers of tanks, but to open a principled supply that will stop Russian evil. And we also count that your next gatherings will go down in history as Ramstein of F16 and long-range missiles. It is in your power to guarantee such artillery and anti-aircraft defense that will crush terror. It is in your power to make the victory. So may your decisions hit accurately! Just like our heroes on the front lines. Glory to all of our soldiers – soldiers and sailors, sergeants and foremen, officers and generals! And thank each and every one of you who defends freedom! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Today&#x27;s Ramstein to strengthen our resilience – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-20</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today is the day of Ramstein – and defense news for Ukraine, which our diplomatic marathon brings week after week. Not everything can be announced in public – what is being talked about in Ramstein. It is a closed-door discussion – and it should be. But in general, we can conclude that today&#x27;s Ramstein will strengthen our resilience. The partners are firm in their attitude – they will support Ukraine as much as necessary for our victory. Yes, we will still have to fight for the supply of modern tanks, but every day we make it more obvious there is no alternative to making the decision on tanks. I addressed the participants in the Ramstein meeting today, our Defense Contact Group. And I thank all the partners who firmly supported the Ukrainian position in the discussions that took place. In general, several things were achieved during the week. It&#x27;s what our diplomatic marathon, which has been going on since my visit to Washington, has brought. Daily calls and negotiations. Public and non-public. We&#x27;ve managed to significantly strengthen our artillery fist. It&#x27;s extremely strong – both guns and rounds. We have good results with armored vehicles – several hundred combat vehicles have been added to our arsenal. Significant results concerning rockets for multiple launch rocket systems and our anti-aircraft guns. One of the biggest defense packages has been announced by the United States. And I thank President Biden, all the congressmen, all Americans who KNOW that freedom cannot lose. Thanks to our European allies – all the countries that this week took another step in supporting our common defense. Denmark, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, the UK, Finland, Netherlands and others – thank you! Thanks to Canada – and personally to Prime Minister Trudeau! The only thing worth emphasizing is the time, the delivery time. Each agreement must be implemented as quickly as possible – for our defense. The next week, for which we are already preparing, should also bring its defensive fruits. Today, I met with the US senators who arrived in Kyiv – Messrs. Graham, Blumenthal and Whitehouse. Thank you for meaningful negotiations. This year, it&#x27;s extremely important not to slow down the pace of our cooperation – between Ukraine and the United States – in all spheres. I&#x27;m sure it will be so. The main topic is, of course, defense. Protection of our sky, tanks for Ukraine, we need long-range missiles to liberate our territory. I heard understanding of our needs. I spoke with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. About the general situation on the battlefield in Ukraine and in our Black Sea region. About how to implement specific points of our Peace Formula – useful for absolutely everyone in the world. I thank Mr. President for supporting our security vision. Today, the ceremony of receiving credentials from the new ambassadors of the partner states that arrived in Ukraine took place. These are Finland, Cyprus, Austria and Libya. I signed the decree to award our soldiers – 153 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Fighters of the 30th, 53rd, 92nd, 93rd and 110th mechanized brigades, 56th motorized infantry brigade, 60th infantry brigade and 102nd ground defense brigade. I thank everyone who fights for Ukraine! And one more thing. Today is the Day of Remembrance of Defenders of Donetsk Airport. It was one of the hardest and important battles for Ukraine. It was the battle in which modern Ukrainians found our eternal strength. It&#x27;s that strength that saved Ukraine, it&#x27;s that strength that demonstrates our steel spirit in the extraordinary resilience and bravery of Ukrainians on the battlefield. I thank everyone who withstood then. I thank everyone who helped then. Great tribute to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine – after February 24, after 2014 and always when our people defended themselves! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world needs more determination and cooperation to stop the tyrant who tries to use famine as his tool – address of President of Ukraine to Berlin Agriculture Ministers&#x27; Conference participants</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-21</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and gentlemen! I would like to greet everyone who believes that in the 21st century there must be no famine anywhere in the world. We in Ukraine do believe that. Famine must forever remain in the past and cannot come back. This must be a global goal! The right for food – just like the right for clean water – should be a fundamental right of every human being. On every continent. And anyone who tries to deprive people of food or water is an enemy not only to those, who are doomed to starve or suffer from thirst but also is an enemy to humanity. We must defeat such enemies together! Ukraine has always been and will always be a responsible participant in global food-market relations. Even having suffered from terrorist aggression from Russia, we continue to supply food to the countries all over the world. Although Russia has blocked our ports on the Black Sea, we have found a diplomatic way to resume exports. And I would like to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Guterres and to the President of the Republic of Türkiye Mr. Erdoğan for their timely and effective participation, which resulted in the Black Sea Grain Initiative. This brought millions of tonnes of Ukrainian products back to the world market. Although Russia continues to launch missile attacks at our infrastructure, including ports and transport, and continues brutal battles in the regions that are extremely important for the agricultural production, Ukrainian farmers continue to cultivate the fields. This is our moral constant – there must be wheat on fertile soil, not craters from explosions. We also launched a globally important humanitarian initiative – Grain from Ukraine. We attract the support from developed countries to buy grain and charter ships in order to supply humanitarian food to the countries, which suffer from the threat of famine most of all. And I express my gratitude to everyone who is implementing the initiative Grain from Ukraine with us! Ladies and gentlemen! I call on all of you to take this approach to global food security, based on morality and the need to protect the right of every human for food and water! Before this war which is destroying our potential, including our agricultural potential, we exported six and a half million tonnes of food every month. Due to Russian aggression and actions to block our food exports, the shipments have been cut in half. If we count all that not in tonnes, but in human lives, this will be at least two hundred million people in different countries on three continents – Africa, Asia, and Europe – who now have decreased access to food. Right now, while the discussions at this Forum are going on, more than one hundred ships transporting food are lined up near the Bosphorus. Why? Because they need to be inspected, and Russian representatives are blocking this inspection. The ships are detained for weeks. It means higher prices for Europe. For Asia, it means a growing threat of social instability. In Africa, for such countries as Ethiopia or Sudan, it means empty tables for thousands and thousands of families... This means that the world needs more determination and more cooperation to stop the aggression that ruins the food market. To stop any state that blocks the sea and destroys food-supply chains. To bring to justice any tyrant who tries to make famine an instrument of political influence. Is it possible to overcome famine? Yes. Is it possible to guarantee food security? Yes. Is it possible to stabilize food prices on the world market? Yes, it is. But to do so, we need to punish the aggressors and to help countries on the edge of famine. This is exactly what Ukraine is doing. This is exactly what our partners are doing. I encourage everyone to join-in! Join our initiative Grain from Ukraine. Join our initiative to create food hubs in Africa – in the regions that are critically dependent on food imports. Get involved in the implementation of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which will stop Russian aggression and restore international law and order in Europe. Thank you for your attention! And I invite you to Kyiv to make concrete arrangements! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every day we lose people whom we will always remember and regret they&#x27;re not coming back – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-21</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Ukrainian women! Today was a long day – operational decisions, international communication, and various issues that deserve attention and response. But now I want to say only one thing. I don&#x27;t want to talk for a long time. Today, we said farewell to those whose lives were taken by the helicopter crash in Brovary. Denys Monastyrsky, his colleagues from the ministry: Yevhen Yenin, Yuriy Lubkovych, Tetiana Shutiak, Mykhailo Pavlushko, Mykola Anatsky, Andriy Marynchenko... Guys from the crew: Oleksandr Vasylenko, Kostiantyn Kovalenko, Ivan Kasianov... A woman and a child who were just going to kindergarten in the morning... Mother Olena Ponomarenko and her daughter Milana Ponomarenko... My condolences to all relatives and friends... It hurts to think about it, it hurts to say about it. Denys was a professional, genuine person, exactly what the Minister of Internal Affairs should be. Every day we lose people, whom we will always remember and regret that they&#x27;re not coming back. You cannot bring back Ukrainians, patriots, and people who are professional and simply loyal to themselves and the state. I wish we could all feel that today. Feel how many lives, how many bright people have been taken by wartime. I would like us all to honor their memory today… Great tribute to all those, whose lives were taken away by the war! Great tribute to all those, who gave their lives for Ukraine! We are doing everything to remove this war from our land. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine is united because it is strong. Ukraine is strong because it is united - President&#x27;s greetings on the Day of Unity</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-22</span></div>
  <p>Dear people! Today we celebrate the Day of Unity of Ukraine. This historical event passed on two pieces of wisdom to the next generations of Ukrainians. If the struggle is not stopped, sooner or later a unified and independent state will be restored. If true unity is not attained, independence will be lost. We have always known about the first piece of wisdom. And on February 24, we proved that we had mastered the second. This became a new revival of our Ukrainian unity. And it&#x27;s not only uniting two banks of the river. It&#x27;s uniting millions of people. It&#x27;s the unity of all our lands. All our regions. Where all for one and one for all. Every region is protecting each other. All of us have no longer strange cities, villages, or streets. Every city is a native city. Every village is a native village. Every street is a native street. Even if we have never been there in our life. And fighters from Kyiv, Lviv, Kryvyi Rih, Zhytomyr, Luhansk and many other cities are fighting for Mariupol, Kupyansk and Izyum. And fighters from Izyum, Kupyansk and Mariupol and many other cities are fighting for Avdiivka, Bakhmut and Soledar. And we all together are defending Kyiv. And we all together are defending Kharkiv. And we all together are liberating Kherson. And we all together, no matter where we were born and where we grew up, say today: I will defend my Ukraine. My unity. My Zakarpattia, my Volyn, my Podillia, my Tavria, my Sivershchyna, my Polissia, my Naddniprianshchyna, my Donbas, my Halychyna, my Prydniprovia, my Slobozhanshchyna, my Pryazovia, my Bukovyna and, of course, my Crimea. And it&#x27;s not &quot;yours&quot; by any means. Our unity is strong. It&#x27;s strong with the walls of Akkerman Fortress, Palanok Castle, Khotyn Fortress and Kamianets-Podilsky Castle, Medzhybizh Castle, Lubart&#x27;s Castle, Genoese Fortress. Our unity shines with gold-topped Lavra monasteries. Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, Pochaiv Lavra and Sviatohirsk Lavra. Unity is St. Sophia Cathedral, St. George&#x27;s Cathedral, the Big Khan Mosque of Bakhchysarai and the synagogue in Dnipro. Unity is encoded in the patterns of our embroidery, the storylines of Kosiv painted ceramics, the Petrykivka decorative painting and the Ornek ornament. Unity can be heard in the sounds of the kobza, bandura, trembita and Crimean Tatar zurna musical instruments. Unity plays beautifully in the music of Leontovych, Skoryk, and Ivasyuk. Unity is rhymed in the lines of Franko, Ukrainka, Shevchenko, Stus, Symonenko and Kostenko. Unity is painted with colors in the canvases of Prymachenko, Bilokur and Marchuk. Unity reigns majestically on Mount Hoverla and Ai-Petri peak. Unity flourishes in bloom of cherry blossom, in the Valley of Narcissus, Sofiyivka Park, Askania-Nova nature reserve. Unity is mysteriously silent in the rocks of Dovbush, basalt columns, Oleshky Sands, the Dniester canyon, the &quot;Tunnel of Love,&quot; on the Chernihiv Rampart and the slopes of Vytachiv. Unity thunders at Pivdenmash, Antonov, Kharkiv Tractor Plant and Kryvorizhstal. Unity is extracted in the mines of Luhansk region and Lviv region. Unity is illuminated by knowledge in Kyiv, Berdyansk, Lviv, Hlukhiv, Ostroh, Kharkiv and Chernivtsi. Unity roars in the waves of the rivers of Dnipro, the Danube, the Southern Bug, the Tisza, and the Siversky Donets. In the waters of lakes of Svityaz, Synevyr and Syvash. Across Ukraine. In the summer. In the autumn. In the winter. In the spring. We are defending all this. Together. And we will win. Together. And the entire Ukraine will hear the sounds of victory. My beloved Zakarpattia, Volyn, Podillia, Tavria, Sivershchyna, Polissia, Naddniprianshchyna, Halychyna, Prydniprovia, Slobozhanshchyna, Pryazovia, Bukovyna, Donbas, and, of course, Crimea... My Ukraine. Our Ukraine. We are united because we are strong. We are strong because we are united. Dear people, Happy Ukrainian Unity Day! Dear invincible people, Happy Ukrainian Unity Day! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is by justice that the strength of society and the strength of the state are united - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-22</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! The first and foremost I want to talk about today is justice. Justice, which, by the way, is one of the foundations of unity. In a society that feels justice, the unity of people is always stronger. Today, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dismissed a deputy minister who was exposed by NABU. Law enforcers have every opportunity to conduct an investigation and bring the case to the court. And I want this to be our signal to all those whose actions or behavior violate the principle of justice. Of course, now the main focus is on defense, foreign policy, and war. But this does not mean that I do not see or hear what is being said in society at different levels, both at the central level and in the regions. And this week will be a time for appropriate decisions. These decisions have already been prepared. I don&#x27;t want to announce them now, but it will all be fair. I understand what has drawn people&#x27;s attention. In each situation, we will analyze everything in detail. The issues related to energy and procurement. The relations between the central government and the regions. Everything related to procurement for the military. And so on. Society will receive full information, and the state will take the necessary powerful steps. In addition, our special services are making progress in their work on people who deserve at least sanctions for their activities against Ukraine, its independence and the Ukrainian people. We will take appropriate steps as well. And this is not something temporary, this is a real response. These are concrete actions. This is what we all expect from our institutions. From the state. I want this to be clear: there will be no return to what used to be in the past, to the way various people close to state institutions or those who spent their entire lives chasing a chair used to live. I thank law enforcement officers who protect the law, the interests of the state, and ensure justice! I am grateful to the journalists who are looking into all the facts and establishing the full picture! We all have to do our part for our unity. It is by justice that the strength of society and the strength of the state are united. And one more thing. Today, our friend Boris Johnson visited Ukraine - Kyiv, Bucha, Borodyanka. A man who does not need any special introduction. Together with him, we talked to students of Shevchenko University. This is also quite symbolic - exactly on our day, the Day of Unity. Symbolic because the struggle for freedom unites different people, different nations. And we have really brought our Ukrainian unity, our historical unification, which we achieved in the first hours of February 24, to international relations over the past year. The free world has united as it has not been united for a long time. It is very important to maintain unity. We need to do everything we can to keep people who value freedom united and effective. We are interested in Boris and our other people like him working on issues of supporting Ukraine in the world, on issues of defending freedom. This is worth remembering for all Ukrainians: the British contribution to our defense is extremely significant. I thank all British people, absolutely all our friends in Britain, the entire society for it. I thank Mr. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for his powerful decisions, for his policies that make the free world stronger. This is what we all should make this year. A year of justice for Ukraine. A year of unity of all of us for the sake of freedom and victory. A year of strength of Ukraine and all those who value freedom. I am grateful to each of our warriors: all those who are at the front, all those who help, all those who save! I thank our partners for their vital support! I am grateful to everyone who understands that we can only go this way together and only by helping each other. Only honestly and fairly. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>After the end of the war, American business can become a locomotive of global economic growth - President of Ukraine&#x27;s address to the participants of the meeting of the National Association of State Chambers</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-23</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for your attention to Ukraine and for this opportunity to address those who create the globally important economic strength of America! Tomorrow is eleven months since the start of Russia’s brutal and predatory full-scale war against Ukraine. This is the time when Ukraine, the United States and all our allies and partners are united as never before. What have we achieved together during this time? We fight every day to defend our people, our borders and our values. And we managed to stop the spread of Russian aggression. Today we can say with confidence that we can overcome this evil on Ukrainian soil. Even though Russia has found a terrorist ally in the face of the Iranian regime, which supplies weapons to the Kremlin. Thanks to the courage of our soldiers holding back the occupiers, and thanks to the leadership of the United States of America, which has consolidated the world in defense of freedom, we see how to win this battle. Yet to win, we must engage all our resolve and our strength. It is like starting your own business and working every day from morning till night, every day, so that one day you can see how your dream is becoming true – when you finally have your own operating business. Anyone who has such an experience – the experience of starting their own business and implementing their dreams – will never forget how much effort it takes. The same is defending freedom. As well as defending the basic values of any normal society. At the beginning of this address, I called the Russian war against Ukraine a predatory one. And this is not a random word. Perhaps this is exactly what connects the Kremlin with some anti-democratic regimes in various parts of the world, such as the Iranian regime, – what makes them accomplices. On the entire territory, temporarily occupied by the Russian troops, robbery is reigning. Everything they have not destroyed, they are stealing and shipping to Russia. Everything… Russians are stealing grain and agricultural machinery from Ukrainian farmers. The occupiers dismantle the factories and send the equipment to Russia. Warehouses, shops and people’s homes are being looted. And they kidnap people – they see people as a resource. About two million Ukrainians were forcibly taken to Russia – deported. The fact that Russia tried to steal the part of our land by declaring an illegal annexation – is the finalization of their predatory policy. This is why we so need your support now. Here, in Ukraine, we are defending not only independence and not only the international order. Here in Ukraine, we are defending everything that made you, in particular, who you are. We are defending freedom and property; everyone’s right to have their dream and everyone’s duty to live according to the law; the right of every family to stay safe and the happiness of every family to be part of their community. All this cannot be granted. All this can only be won. Global freedom has long been lacking global victories. Ukraine, together with the United States, along with our partners – is meeting this deficit. However, we need to walk this path together – until the victory. And – when we&#x27;ll be able to end this war by throwing out the occupiers – in the same manner together we&#x27;ll be able to start the difficult work of rebuilding Ukraine – our cities, our economy, our infrastructure. It is already clear that this will be the largest economic project of our time in Europe. It is obvious that American business can become the locomotive that will once again push forward global economic growth. We have already managed to attract attention and have cooperation with such giants of the international financial and investment world as Black Rock, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Such American brands as Starlink or Westinghouse have already become part of our, Ukrainian, way. Your brilliant defense systems – such as HIMARS or Bradleys – are already uniting our history of freedom with your enterprises. We are waiting for Patriots. We are looking closely at Abrams. Thousands of such examples are possible! And everyone can become a big business by working with Ukraine. In all sectors – from weapons and defense to construction, from communications to agriculture, from transport to IT, from banks to medicine. I believe that freedom must always win. And, I invite you to work with us right now. Thanks to all American people – from leaders to every American! God bless our countries and our heroes! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Officials will no longer be able to travel abroad for non-governmental purposes - President&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-23</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report of the day. The first is military issues. Today we had several detailed conversations with our commanders about the situation in the operational directions. Sometimes it seems that some people in the rear cities have completely forgotten about the war and started to ignore reality, using the protection of our heroes. Ignoring the war is a luxury that no one can afford. Fierce fighting continues in the main operational directions, particularly in Donbas. Enemy shelling and offensives around the clock. However, the battle for Donbas continues. The battle for the south continues. We see what forces Russia is amassing and know how to respond. We will certainly respond to the enemy&#x27;s regular terrorist attacks on our border areas - Sumy and Kharkiv regions. Ukraine will not show weakness. The state will not show weakness. I’ve signed several decrees today. There is a principled decision of the NSDC on officials traveling abroad. It applies to all officials of the central government and various other levels of local government. It applies to law enforcers, people&#x27;s deputies, prosecutors and all those who are supposed to work for the state and in the state. If they want to rest now, they will rest outside the civil service. Officials will no longer be able to travel abroad for vacation or for any other non-governmental purpose. Within five days, the Cabinet of Ministers is to develop a border-crossing procedure for officials so that only a real working trip can be the reason for border crossing. Another NSDC decision today concerns our spiritual independence, which we are strengthening and will continue to strengthen. Sanctions have been imposed against 22 Russian citizens who, under the guise of spirituality, support terror and genocidal policy. Also, we have already made personnel decisions - some today, some tomorrow - regarding officials of various levels in ministries and other central government bodies, in the regions, and in the law enforcement system. I’ve held several meetings on our international activities. One was related to the results of Ramstein and what we managed to get for Ukraine. The second meeting was about the new stage of our diplomatic marathon, which was launched after my visit to Washington. I’ve had more than 30 negotiations of various levels with the leaders of our partner states - those we can talk about openly. This marathon yielded the results we needed, a real strengthening of our defense. We are now working to fill February with even more substantive contacts with leaders. Today, I addressed the participants of the winter meeting of American business leaders who are members of the National Association of State Chambers. These are more than 100,000 entrepreneurs who employ about half of the American workforce. It is important for Americans at all levels to know and feel how important and historically necessary our cooperation is - cooperation of Ukraine and the United States. And one more thing. Tomorrow marks exactly 11 months of the full-scale war. It will be the 335th day. A day we will pass in the same way as the 334th, uniting all our forces for one thing - victory. For the sake of Ukraine&#x27;s victory. Not of someone against someone among us. But for the sake of the whole of Ukraine. For the sake of the victory of our entire country in the war for freedom and independence for all Ukrainians. It will happen. And all the steps necessary for this will be taken. I thank all our warriors at the front! Today I would like to celebrate our anti-aircraft gunners of the Air Forces - you gave us a good day. Russian aircraft, helicopter and missiles were shot down. I would also like to thank the warriors of the 35th separate marine brigade and the 79th separate air assault brigade for their bravery and the results Ukraine needs in the Donetsk direction. Thank you, guys! I thank everyone who steadfastly defends the positions of our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We need a strong state, and Ukraine will be just that - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-24</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have continued our diplomatic marathon and have new concrete results for our defense, which are very important. Today I had extensive negotiations with President of France Macron. We discussed many topics. I thank Mr. President for his willingness to strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s air defense and expand our armored cooperation. This armored element is becoming increasingly important for the situation at the front. So is the artillery element. I thank France and Emmanuel personally for the much-needed decisions to strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s artillery. I am also grateful for the respective leadership within our anti-war coalition. Russia is preparing for a new wave of aggression with the forces it can mobilize. The occupiers are already increasing pressure in the Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other directions. And they want to increase pressure on a larger scale. In order not to recognize the mistake of aggression, the masters of Russia want to throw more of their people and equipment into the fighting. This means that all of us in the free world must step up our cooperation to not only respond to Russia&#x27;s regular crimes. Although this will happen, of course. There will be a response. But to prevent new Russian criminal actions as much as possible. Our forces must retain the initiative in the war. And I heard today a full understanding of the situation both in a conversation with Mr. President Macron and in a conversation with Mr. President of Finland, who was on a visit to Kyiv today. There is a new package of support from Finland, including defense support. There is a willingness to strengthen sanctions against Russia and to join our diplomatic initiatives. We have a vision of how we can use this year to our countries’ advantage to cooperate within European and Euro-Atlantic institutions. That is, today, thanks to the French and Finnish stages of our diplomatic marathon, we have significantly strengthened Ukraine&#x27;s defense. The main thing now is the speed of implementation of everything we agreed upon. Today I discussed in great detail the points of our Peace Formula - what can be done together with France, what can be done together with Finland. It is very important for European leadership in these diplomatic efforts to be tangible. And today, in particular in my conversation with Emmanuel, I was pleased to hear his leadership initiatives. I am also grateful to Finland for the vision of the role of this country in guaranteeing our common security under the Peace Formula. I signed several decrees on awarding the defenders of our country. Today is the Day of the Foreign Intelligence of Ukraine. So today I have specially honored intelligence officers with awards. Of course, I can&#x27;t publicly say the names and specific reasons for the awards, but this is for the work that allows our state to see and understand more. And I want to congratulate all our intelligence officers - those who expand Ukraine&#x27;s capabilities and significantly reduce the enemy&#x27;s capabilities. Thank you for your service! I also signed decrees on awarding the warriors of our army, in particular the 93rd separate mechanized brigade, for their personal bravery and heroism. As well as warriors of the National Guard, in particular the 3rd and 4th operational brigades of the National Guard. I am thankful for the strength and resilience to each of our warriors and to each family of such warriors! Today, I also awarded the Air Forces for their much-needed results. And territorial defense warriors - for heroism and exemplary performance of combat missions. Such decrees are always a special honor for me. So is another decree signed today. The capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, starts celebrating the 700th anniversary of its foundation. All this time, the histories of our nations have been closely intertwined. And we actually share a common destiny of our freedom: the more protected one nation is, the more protected the other is. Perhaps this is understood more clearly now than ever before in our history. Ukraine will always be grateful to Lithuania, to Mr. President Nausėda, to all Lithuanian leaders, to all Lithuanian families who perceived the Russian aggression against Ukraine as an attack on their freedom. Who help us protect our common future in a free and peaceful Europe. Today, I signed a decree awarding Vilnius the honorary distinction of a &quot;Rescuer City&quot; for everything that the city and Lithuania as a whole have done to help us in the fight against Russian terror. I thank each and every one who fights and works to protect freedom! I thank everyone who helps! By the way, there is a lot of talk about tanks now. About the modern tanks we need. And about how to fill this deficit. A lot of effort, words, and promises. But it is important to see the reality: it is not about five, or ten, or fifteen tanks. The need is greater. Every day we are doing everything necessary to fill the deficit. And I am grateful to everyone who supports us in this. However, discussions need to end with decisions. Decisions to really strengthen our defense against terrorists. Our allies have the necessary number of tanks. When the necessary weight of decisions is reached, we will be happy to express gratitude for every weighty decision. We are still working on this. And one more thing. Today, society has seen yet another set of personnel decisions that have been made. I emphasize the phrase – &quot;yet another&quot;. We will continue to take appropriate steps - the public will see each of them and, I am sure, will support them. Any internal issues that hinder the state are being removed and will continue to be removed. It is fair, it is necessary for our defense, and it helps our rapprochement with European institutions. We need a strong state, and Ukraine will be just that. And today, by my decree, I put into effect another decision of the National Security and Defense Council. Details will follow later. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must form a tank fist of freedom whose hits will not let tyranny stand up again - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-25</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is a day of extremely good news for Ukraine. There is a tank coalition. There is a decision to launch the supply of tanks for our defense. Modern tanks. I started this day with a conversation with Chancellor Scholz, primarily about Leopards for Ukraine. And this is exactly the kind of conversation we expected. I thank Mr. Chancellor, all German politicians and public figures for their willingness to strengthen the defense of Europe! There is a very powerful step by the United States - this is how the day begins in America. Ukraine will receive Abrams, thank you for this decision. I personally thank Mr. President Biden, I thank the Congress, I thank every American family for the tangible strength of American global leadership! I am grateful to all our allies for their willingness to provide us with modern and much-needed tanks. All this proves the most important fact for the world today - the fact that freedom is only getting stronger. And the way we are all working together to strengthen freedom, to defend Ukraine and Europe, is a historic achievement of the leaders who are working now. The key thing now is speed and volume. The speed of training of our military, the speed of supplying tanks to Ukraine. The volume of tank support. We must form a tank fist, a fist of freedom whose hits will not let tyranny stand up again. We can do it. Together and only in the same way as we are making decisions today. Important decisions. It is very important that there is progress in other aspects of our defense cooperation as well. Today I spoke with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. We have to unlock the supply of long-range missiles to Ukraine, it is important for us to expand our cooperation in artillery, we have to achieve the supply of aircraft to Ukraine. And this is a dream. And this is a task. An important task for all of us. The more defense support our heroes at the front receive from the world, the sooner Russia&#x27;s aggression will end and the more reliable the security guarantees for Ukraine and all our partners will be after the war. The terrorist state must lose. The right to life must be protected. And it will be so. There are two more important decisions today. The first is from the ECHR. The second is from UNESCO. The European Court of Human Rights has announced its decision on the admissibility of the case concerning Russia&#x27;s seizure of the territories of the east of Ukraine in 2014 and the occupiers&#x27; large-scale violation of human rights. This is still an interim legal decision. But thanks to this decision, we have become closer to the day when Russia will be held accountable for its aggression, and on the same scale from a legal point of view as Russia has invested in this evil. UNESCO has inscribed the historic center of Odesa on the World Heritage List. Moreover, on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Danger because of the war unleashed by Russia. This international step will help us defend our Odesa. Ukraine and the world give protection. Russia can give nothing but terror and strikes. These are facts. Today I had a meeting with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The conversation was primarily about our people who were forcibly deported to Russia by the occupiers. These are both adults and our children. The world needs a global mechanism of influence in such situations. We need a mechanism to protect and return such people, to bring to justice all those responsible for deportation. I am confident that the UN institutions can show their leadership in resolving this issue. Today I would like to praise our units that continue to hold back the occupier&#x27;s attacks in the Donetsk region. This is where Russia is constantly trying to break our defense. Dozens of enemy attacks every day. And at least hundreds of examples of heroism of our warriors every day. I thank the warriors of the 110th separate mechanized brigade, 79th separate air assault brigade, 35th separate marine brigade and 55th separate artillery brigade. Thank you, warriors, for your resilience and courage, which inspire the world to provide more and more assistance to Ukraine! And one more thing. I would like to express gratitude for the very touching words of support and congratulations that I have heard and seen from so many different people. From the military. From the leaders and ordinary people. From all Ukrainians and foreigners. From colleagues now and colleagues before. Thank you all! I think we have the same wish, in fact. A common wish. This is victory. We will do it. We are doing everything for the sake of Ukraine&#x27;s victory. And it will happen. I know it will. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>President of Ukraine: Russian aggression can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-26</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, we withstood another massive missile strike by terrorists. A strike that fully confirms everything we have been talking about with our partners both yesterday and since the beginning of our diplomatic marathon. This evil, this Russian aggression can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons. The terrorist state will not understand anything else. Weapons on the battlefield. Weapons that protect our skies. New sanctions against Russia, i.e. political and economic weapons. And legal weapons - we need to work even harder to establish a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and to compensate for all the damage caused by this war at the expense of Russian assets. Every Russian missile against our cities, every Iranian drone used by terrorists is an argument why we need more weapons. Only weapons neutralize terrorists. And I am grateful to everyone in the world who is really fighting terror together with us. Who is speeding up the supply of necessary defense equipment to Ukraine and who is willing to increase sanctions pressure on the terrorist state. In particular, we are expanding our tank coalition - there is a corresponding decision of Canada, and I am grateful for it. We already have 12 countries in our tank coalition. Today, thanks to the air defense systems provided to Ukraine and the professionalism of our warriors, we managed to shoot down most of the Russian missiles and Shaheds. These are at least hundreds of lives saved and dozens of infrastructure facilities preserved. And I thank our Air Forces, each and every one who last night, this morning and afternoon ensured the defense of Ukraine against terrorists’ missiles and drones. I would like to especially praise the warriors of the 96th Kyiv, 160th Odesa and 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades. Unfortunately, it is difficult to provide 100% protection with air defense alone. Especially when terrorists use ballistic missiles. Today there were missile hits. Unfortunately, there are wounded and dead. My condolences to all the families and friends... This Russian terror requires asymmetrical responses. We need a new movement of our forces at the front. We need to ensure the defeat of the terrorists&#x27; ground forces. Whatever the Russian occupiers are planning, our preparation must be stronger. We talk about it with our partners. And we discuss it at the meetings of the Staff. Today was just such a meeting. Details about the situation in the Donetsk region. Bakhmut, Vuhledar and the battle for Donbas in general. I am grateful to all our units who demonstrate the resilience Ukraine needs, exhausting the occupier and destroying it. The more Russia loses in this battle for Donbas, the less its overall potential will be. At the meeting of the Staff we also discussed in detail what we should prepare for in the coming months. We know what the occupiers are planning. We are countering it. This applies both to the supply of weapons and ammunition and to the overall strengthening of our defense forces. Today, I held operational meetings on the situation in the energy sector - on existing deficits and recovery from terrorist attacks. Repair crews are working in all locations of the hits. As of now, there are electricity supply restrictions in most of our regions. The most difficult situation is in Odesa, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Sumy and Poltava regions. Power engineers, utility workers and everyone involved in stabilizing the energy system will do everything necessary to restore generation and technical supply capacity. I thank everyone involved in this work. I also thank everyone in the world who has helped and is helping Ukraine with energy equipment. To every country, every company and every person - to those millions of our friends who, through United24 or other support tools, prove that Russian terror must lose. And one more thing. Unfortunately, I have to repeat this for those who did not hear it well. Any trip abroad by government officials, MPs, representatives of local authorities and other persons authorized to perform the functions of the state or local self-government, any of their trips abroad must comply with the relevant decision of the National Security and Defense Council, which you have all seen. There will be no other trips abroad by officials or MPs in wartime. I think this is fair. I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! I thank everyone who is working for our country and society! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by Russian terrorists! Russia will be held accountable for terror. Glory to Ukraine!</p>
