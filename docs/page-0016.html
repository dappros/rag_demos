  <h2>Address by the President of Ukraine on the occasion of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-27</span></div>
  <p>Today, as always, Ukraine honors the memory of millions of Holocaust victims. We know and remember that indifference kills along with hatred. Indifference and hatred are always capable of creating evil together only. That is why it is so important that everyone who values life should show determination when it comes to saving those whom hatred seeks to destroy. Today we remember the Righteous Among the Nations. Different people in different countries who were equally determined to save lives. Today we remember the determination of the global coalition that stopped Nazism. And today we repeat it even more strongly than before: never again to hatred; never again to indifference. The more nations of the world overcome indifference, the less space there will be in the world for hatred. Eternal memory to all victims of the Holocaust!</p>

  <h2>Any neutral flag of Russian athletes is stained with blood – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-27</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today we are starting a marathon of honesty, which will be aimed at clearing the leadership of international Olympic structures of hypocrisy and any attempts to bring representatives of the terrorist state into world sports. One cannot but be disappointed by the statements of the current President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach. I spoke with him several times. And I never heard how he is going to protect sports from war propaganda if he returns Russian athletes to international competitions. There is no such thing as neutrality when a war like this is going on. And we know how often tyrannies try to use sports for their ideological interests. It is obvious that any neutral flag of Russian athletes is stained with blood. I do not want to get into what exactly motivated Mr. Bach to promote such an initiative. But we will do everything so that the world will protect sports from political and any other influence of the terrorist state, which is simply inevitable if Russian athletes participate in competitions. And especially – at the Paris Olympics. Ukrainian athletes are forced to defend the lives of their loved ones and the freedom of our people from Russian aggression. Russian strikes took the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian men and women who could have brought their talents to world sports. Russia must stop aggression and terror, and only after that it will be possible to talk about Russian participation in the context of the Olympic movement. Olympic principles and war are fundamentally opposed to each other. The situation at the front, and in particular in Donetsk region – near Bakhmut and Vuhledar, remains extremely acute. The occupiers are not just storming our positions – they are deliberately and methodically destroying these towns and villages around them. Artillery, aviation, missiles. The Russian army has no shortage of means of destruction. And it can be stopped only by force. Our soldiers, who are defending the areas in Donetsk region, are real heroes. I thank each of you guys for your bravery! And, by the way, I invite Mr. Bach to Bakhmut. So that he could see with his own eyes that neutrality does not exist. I spoke today with students, teachers and graduates of the College of Europe in Natolin and Bruges. This is a special educational institution that prepares specialists to work in and with European structures. It is precisely such specialists that we need, in particular, for the full integration of our state with the European Union. Ukrainians are already studying under the programs of the College of Europe. And we have already started creating such a college in Ukraine. And this underlines our desire to fully and as soon as possible integrate with the EU. And also, I am sure, it will enable Ukrainians to help protect freedom and European values both in our region and throughout Europe. I heard from the rector of the college in Natolin that free Europe now has a Ukrainian face. And such words mean a lot. We will always do everything to increase our potential in relations with the EU, in particular, personnel potential. That is why we need our own Ukrainian College of Europe. And it will be. Today we have important news from Belgium – the country where the governing structures of the European Union are located. There is a decision by the Belgian government on a package of support for our defense. It is that will strengthen our air defense. It is that will increase the mobility of our troops on the battlefield. I thank you for this support. I thank all the countries, all the leaders, who this week proved with their decisions that Russian aggression will be defeated. And one more. A ceremony honoring the memory of all victims of the Holocaust was held this morning in Kyiv near the Menorah memorial sign in Babyn Yar. Today is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. And even at such a time, during the full-scale war, Ukraine, together with the entire civilized world, feels and shares the pain that still remains in the world from the crimes of Nazism. We remember. And so we resist the evil&#x27;s attempts to return. I thank everyone who protects humanity together with Ukraine! I thank all our soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine needs long-range missiles so that terrorists do not have a feeling of impunity – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-28</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! And dear all our partners! Today, at 9:00 a.m., the Russian army launched a missile attack on our city of Kostiantynivka, in Donetsk region. The enemy used S-300 missiles. Hitting the residential area. As of now, 17 names are on the list of victims. Fourteen have been injured. Three people have died. My condolences to families and friends... These Russian missiles hit four residential buildings in Kostiantynivka. And such shelling, unfortunately, is an everyday reality in our territories, which the Russian army reaches with such missiles. Donbas, Kharkiv region, the south of the country... It would have been possible to stop this Russian terror if we could provide the appropriate missile capabilities of our military. So that terrorists do not have a sense of impunity. Ukraine needs long-range missiles – in particular, to remove this possibility of the occupiers to place their missile launchers somewhere far from the front line and destroy Ukrainian cities with them. Thank you to everyone in the world – politicians, public figures, journalists, and ordinary people who insist with us that there cannot be any taboo in the supply of weapons to protect against Russian terror. We will do everything we can to ensure that partners open up this vital supply – in particular, the supply of ATACMS and other similar weapons. As it is necessary to protect life. Protect such cities as Kostyantynivka or, for example, Kharkiv. Today, I continued our marathon of honesty, which should return international sports bodies to true Olympic principles. I addressed the presidents of the leading international sports federations with a letter. The appeal is simple and fair – to determine with the decision of the International Olympic Committee, which, unfortunately, wants to open sports to the propaganda influence of the terrorist state. If Russian athletes appear in international competitions, it is only a matter of time before they begin justifying Russia&#x27;s aggression and using the symbols of terror. And it is also only a matter of time – when the Kremlin will start using the existing unprincipled &quot;flexibility&quot; of the International Olympic Committee to say that the world agrees to make concessions to the aggressor. It cannot be ignored that every day Russia continues its terror. Today, I signed a decree on the implementation of the NSDC decision on sanctions against legal entities and individuals used by the aggressor state to transport military equipment and soldiers by rail. It concerns 185 companies and individuals. Their assets in Ukraine are being blocked, the available property will be used for our defense. We will work to ensure that similar blocking is applied by other countries. I thank everyone who helps us strengthen sanctions against Russia! And by the way, thanks to all the investigators who are exposing the ways that the terrorist state is using to try to circumvent sanctions! Thank you to everyone who eliminates the consequences of Russian shelling and saves the wounded! And of course – I thank each of our soldiers at the front who defend our positions and destroy the occupier! I especially want to note today the units most effectively defending Donetsk region. This is the 21st separate battalion of the 56th separate motorized infantry brigade – thank you for your effectiveness in repelling the Russian assaults! Soldiers of the 26th and 55th separate artillery brigades – thank you for your accuracy! Ninety-second Separate Mechanized Brigade – thank you, guys! Thank you to everyone who provides the necessary results for Ukraine every day and every night! And we will respond to every Russian strike. That&#x27;s for sure. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must make time our weapon - we must speed up the supply of new weaponry options to Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-29</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. The main focus, of course, was on the situation at the front, primarily Donetsk and the southern directions. The situation is very tough. Bakhmut, Vuhledar and other areas in the Donetsk region are under constant Russian attacks. There are constant attempts to break through our defense. The enemy does not count its people and, despite numerous casualties, maintains a high intensity of attacks. In some of its wars, Russia has lost in total less people than it loses there, in particular near Bakhmut. And this can only be countered by extraordinary resilience and a full understanding that by defending the Donetsk region, our warriors are defending the whole of Ukraine. Because every prevented step of the enemy there means dozens of prevented steps of the occupiers in other directions. I am grateful to all our units and to each warrior personally who, despite everything, is holding their ground and repelling enemy attacks in the Donetsk region. Today, I would like to praise the warriors of the 72nd separate mechanized brigade and the 80th separate air assault brigade for their perseverance in performing combat missions in the Donetsk direction. I would also like to commend our warriors in the southern areas. In particular, the 44th and 406th artillery brigades, as well as reconnaissance units of the 123rd and 124th territorial defense brigades. Thank you for your accuracy, warriors, thank you for your bravery! The Commander-in-Chief, the commanders of operational directions, and the Minister of Defense reported at the Staff meeting today on the nature of the enemy&#x27;s actions, our response, and the supply of ammunition and equipment to combat units. The head of intelligence reported on the possible shift in the situation in the near future. We are doing everything to ensure that our pressure outweighs the occupiers&#x27; assault capabilities. And it is very important to maintain the dynamics of defense support from our partners. The speed of supply has been and will be one of the key factors in this war. Russia hopes to drag out the war, to exhaust our forces. So we have to make time our weapon. We must speed up the events, speed up the supply and opening of new necessary weaponry options for Ukraine. This week, we have significant defense results in relations with the United States, Germany, Poland, Canada, Belgium, Norway, Italy, and other countries. We have to make the next week no less powerful for our defense. Today, I also spoke with President-elect of the Czech Republic Pavel. I heard a full understanding of the situation. I invited Mr. President to visit Ukraine. I am confident that together we will be able to significantly strengthen our common European response to the Russian terrorist threat. Today I held a long meeting with our security sector - the Security Service of Ukraine and other special services. We are strengthening our state and will appropriately stop anyone who tries to weaken Ukraine from within. And one more thing. Today, the Russian army has been shelling Kherson atrociously all day. Residential buildings, various social and transport facilities, including a hospital, post office, and bus station, have been damaged. Two women, nurses, were wounded in the hospital. As of now, there are reports of six wounded and three dead. My condolences to all those who have lost loved ones to Russian terror... In such circumstances, against the backdrop of such constant Russian terrorist attacks on our cities and villages, against the backdrop of constant Russian assaults that try to leave no single intact wall, it is even shocking that we have to convince international sports bureaucrats to refuse any support for the terrorist state. The International Olympic Committee&#x27;s attempt to get Russian athletes back to compete and participate in the Olympics is an attempt to tell the world that terror can allegedly be something acceptable. As if it is possible to turn a blind eye to what Russia is doing to Kherson, to Kharkiv, to Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Today, I sent a letter to Mr. President Macron about this very issue to follow up on our conversation with him on January 24. As we prepare for the Paris Olympics, we must be sure that Russia will not be able to use it or any other international sporting event to promote aggression or its state chauvinism. In the first half of the XX century, too many mistakes were made in Europe that led to horrific tragedies. There was also a major Olympic mistake. The Olympic movement and terrorist states should definitely not intersect. I thank everyone who helps protect our people from Russian terror! I thank each and every one who bravely defends Ukraine in the ranks of our defense and security forces! May the memory of all those who fought for the independence and integrity of Ukraine in the Battle of Kruty and in every other battle that helped our people to survive and gain their own state be bright! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russian terror must lose everywhere and in everything - both on the battlefield and in the absence of ruins in our country - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-30</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I am on a working trip all day - first to Mykolaiv, then to Odesa. Meeting and negotiations with the Danish delegation - with Prime Minister Frederiksen, representatives of the coalition of parties. In particular, with the Danish Minister of Defense and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. They are part of the delegation. We talked in great detail about Ukraine&#x27;s defense needs. About what can help us liberate our territory - our south, our east. And about our needs in the context of rebuilding Ukraine. Mykolaiv is a city the reconstruction of which Denmark has taken patronage over. There is a need for projects in the energy sector, infrastructure, social sphere, and production. An especially sensitive issue for Mykolaiv is water purification and restoration of normal water supply, which was destroyed by the Russian occupiers. There is already a corresponding project with the participation of Denmark, the implementation of which has already begun. But much more needs to be done to restore and modernize what is the basis of our people&#x27;s lives. Today in Mykolaiv, we visited a hospital where our warriors are being saved after wounds. We thanked the doctors and nurses. We supported our defenders. This hospital is just one of those examples where modernization and reconstruction are critical. And I want to thank Denmark, personally Mrs. Prime Minister and other representatives of the Danish Government for their willingness to help Ukraine. For the willingness to support until the full restoration of Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity and until the complete reconstruction of everything necessary for life. This is the fundamental meaning of our cooperation with partners. Russian terror must lose everywhere and in everything - both on the battlefield and in the absence of ruins in our country - so that we can rebuild everything and thus prove that freedom is stronger. Today in Odesa, we spoke in detail about our security and humanitarian initiatives. Denmark, in particular, has supported our Black Sea export initiative and joined the Grain from Ukraine program. The fact that we have made substantial progress on food security proves that we can make progress on the other points of our Peace Formula as well. Today we discussed what exactly Denmark&#x27;s participation in the implementation of the points of the Peace Formula could be. Of course, I thanked Denmark for their defense support, for significantly strengthening our artillery, for their willingness to join the tank coalition. Today we discussed what else we can do to reinforce Ukrainian warriors. We are also coordinating our actions to strengthen sanctions against Russia. I have also called on Denmark to join our efforts to protect sports structures and the international Olympic movement from discrediting by the attempts of certain representatives of the sports bureaucracy to allow Russian athletes to participate in international competitions. Of course, I paid special attention to the internal situation in the Mykolaiv and Odesa regions, holding relevant meetings with the military and regional leadership. It is not only about security, although the security of our south is the first priority, but also about the social situation in the regions, about the economic opportunities available. By the way, I am grateful to all entrepreneurs and employers in Mykolaiv, Odesa, other cities and communities who, despite everything, keep jobs and pay salaries and taxes. This is your concrete and significant contribution to our country&#x27;s ability to defend itself. Our task to endure is a common task. It is the task of the Defense and Security Forces, our entire state, business, and everyone who works for Ukraine&#x27;s victory. Thank you to everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is helping! Thank you to everyone who is defending Odesa, who is defending Mykolaiv, our entire south and all of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are preparing new reforms in Ukraine that will change the social, legal and political reality - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-01-31</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on the day. We are finalizing our preparations for the Ukraine-EU Summit scheduled for this week. In general, this week will be a week of European integration in every sense of the word. We are expecting the news for Ukraine. We are expecting the decisions from our partners in the European Union that will be in line with the level of cooperation achieved between our institutions and the EU, as well as with our progress. Progress, which is obvious - even despite the full-scale war. Today I held a long meeting with the international bloc of the government and the Office. We are preparing Ukrainian positions for negotiations with EU representatives. And very importantly, we are preparing new reforms in Ukraine. Reforms that will change the social, legal and political reality in many ways, making it more human, transparent and effective. But these details will be announced later, based on the results of the relevant meetings. Today, as in fact every day, I held several meetings with the military and the head of intelligence. We are studying the situation in detail in all major operational directions and in the long term. What the occupier is preparing for, and how we are already responding to Russia&#x27;s preparations for a revanche attempt. Our defense and security forces, the Ukrainian government, our partners - all of us are making efforts to ensure that Russia not only fails in regaining ground on the battlefield, but also loses its last hope for aggression in its revanche attempts. Russia&#x27;s defeat will prevent any alternatives to a lasting and reliable peace. I thank all our partners who support this position of Ukraine. Today I spoke with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. I briefed him on the situation on the battlefield - on the constant assaults in the Donetsk region, on the situation in the south and the existing threats. We discussed how our defense cooperation could be supplemented. We separately touched upon the issue of sanctions and Russia&#x27;s international isolation. In particular, I am grateful to Justin for understanding our call to the international Olympic bodies that any concessions to a terrorist state are unacceptable. The Olympic movement and international sport in general must be protected from Russia&#x27;s usual attempts to politicize sports - we have seen this repeatedly at different times. Now, Russian politicization of sports will inevitably mean justification of terror. This must not be allowed. It is only together that the free world can protect sport from those sports bureaucrats who are willing to turn a blind eye to reality for some reason. Today I also spoke with Prime Minister of Belgium Alexander De Croo. I thanked him for the powerful defense package that was recently approved. We discussed our cooperation on international platforms, particularly within the UN. We discussed sanctions against Russia and the next sanctions package. We also talked about cooperation in protecting sports and the Olympic movement from propaganda of terror. And one more thing. Now there is a certain lull with personnel decisions... But this does not mean that all the necessary steps have been taken. There will be decisions. Those in the system who do not meet the fundamental requirements of the state and society should not linger in their chairs. I thank each and every one who is defending the state! I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! I am grateful for every Ukrainian position held at the front! I am also grateful for every destroyed position of the enemy! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Justice will be ensured - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-01</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is a fruitful day for our country - a fruitful day in confronting those who are trying to weaken Ukraine even now. We will not allow anyone to weaken our state. I thank all law enforcement officials who have demonstrated the power of law and the power of the state today. I am grateful to the Government of Ukraine for its prompt personnel response. In particular, today the heads of customs service were dismissed. I have been informed that disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against some of those dismissed. Unfortunately, in some spheres, the only way to guarantee legitimacy is to change leaders along with institutional changes implementation. Change as much as necessary to ensure that people do not abuse power. Today, the Security Service of Ukraine, the State Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Economic Security and the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office have conducted dozens of searches and other actions in different regions and against different individuals in the framework of open criminal proceedings. I do not want to make political assessments that can be used by these individuals in the interests of their defense. But I see from the reaction in society that people approve the actions of law enforcers. Hence, the movement towards justice is tangible. And justice will be ensured. The purity of processes within the Ministry of Defense and the defense forces in general is especially important. Any internal supply, any procurement - everything must be absolutely as clean and honest as the external supply for our defense. Those who interfere with this will not remain in the relevant structures. And today I would like to thank the officers of the National Police of Ukraine, who quickly responded to the disgraceful facts that became known yesterday... Facts of abuse against girls. Criminal proceedings have been initiated. There are the first detentions of the perpetrators. Procedural actions are ongoing. There will be no place for violence in Ukraine. Today was also a rather active day of diplomacy - the President of Austria visited our country together with several ministers of the Austrian government. There are significant intergovernmental agreements, and there is a clear understanding that Austria will not be neutral in the defense of life and Europe. There is a clear Austrian position condemning Russian aggression and willingness to further increase pressure against Russia for terror. I thank Mr. President of Austria, representatives of Austrian municipalities for standing with Ukraine. Of course, today I held several operational meetings with our military. There is a certain increase in the occupiers&#x27; offensive actions at the front – in the east of our country. The situation is becoming even more severe. I am grateful to all our warriors who are ready for this and who demonstrate the resilience Ukraine needs. We have steadfastly gone through all this time, from February to February. The enemy is trying to gain at least something now to show on the anniversary of the invasion that Russia allegedly has some chances. In such circumstances, we all need to be especially united, especially focused on the national interest, and, as a result, especially resilient. I am confident that we will stay like that. In the evening, I signed traditional decrees awarding our warriors. 244 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine received state decorations. I am grateful to everyone who fights for Ukraine! I am grateful to everyone who helps us get the weapons we need! I am grateful to everyone in the world who supports us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This year should be the time when no obstacles remain to the start of negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the EU - President at the joint meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers and the European Commission Board</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-02</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mrs. President of the European Commission, dear Ursula! Dear attendees! Ladies and Gentlemen, European Commissioners, dear government officials, dear Mr. Prime Minister! This is indeed a historic moment, as we have just said - from today you are colleagues in the full sense of the word. My congratulations. Previously, we could say: colleagues in creating a common future for Ukraine and the European Union. Now we say: colleagues in creating a common present reality of Ukraine and the European Union, our life, which is already being united before our eyes. It is being united on completely different, I would say many levels - at the level of our institutions, politics, legal reality, economic life, social life, energy sector, environmental protection, and, of course, our common security and defense. Ukraine and the European Union are no longer separate entities in European life. Our values are common. Our destiny is common. Our enemy is common. Our defense is common. Hence, our life is also being united. Today, Mrs. President of the European Commission, dear Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, handed me a report on the second part of Ukraine&#x27;s responses to the questionnaire provided by the European Commission in the framework of acquiring Ukraine&#x27;s candidacy for EU membership. This report contains a thorough analysis of the state of approximation of law of our country to the EU acquis. But it is also, I think, something more. It is a symbol of the fact that the goal of full-fledged unification of Ukraine and the European Union has already turned into concrete, practical, and rather quick work at your level, Mr. Prime Minister - the level of government officials. Now, based in particular on this report of the European Commission, our Government will begin self-screening - a meaningful self-assessment of what we are already pretty close to and what we still need to work on to bring Ukrainian legislation in specific areas in line with the EU acquis. What is the goal here? I want it to be very clear: This year should be the time when no obstacles remain to the start of negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s full membership in the EU. Ukraine will fulfill its part of the job. It has to do it and it will do it. Society really wants that. Ladies and Gentlemen, members of the Ukrainian government! Your work on self-screening of our country should become the basis of the National Plan of Approximation to the EU Legislation. Mrs. Olha Stefanishyna, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, will be responsible for coordinating the preparation of this Approximation Plan. And I expect that every official of our state will help implement this important and truly historic task at their own level. We must work to adapt Ukraine&#x27;s legal reality to the norms and practices of the European Union as quickly as we have worked to obtain the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. We expect an important decision this spring already. We would really like to see it from our colleagues at the European Commission exactly this spring. The work of our Government and the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the implementation of the seven recommendations outlined in the European Commission&#x27;s opinion on our candidacy is about to be completed. Accordingly, in the spring, it will be time for the European Commission to make an interim assessment of the implementation of these recommendations. Ladies and Gentlemen! Mentally, we are already together - Ukraine and the European Union. The routine of our lives is already being united. It is no longer possible to imagine a united Europe, a united European society without Ukraine, without the people of our country. And our institutions are already de facto interacting as they should between an EU member state and the EU. Now we have to confirm all this at the political and legal levels. The key step will be the launch of membership negotiations, and I hope that we will be able to announce this important step very soon. As for today&#x27;s meeting and negotiations in such a progressive format, the first of its kind in Ukraine – the European Commission Board and the Government of Ukraine, we will be talking about quite obvious economic, social and security specifics. About things that will definitely strengthen us all, both Ukraine and the European Union. So that Ukrainians and all Europeans, our companies and businesses in the EU feel the concrete benefits of our unification. That is, more security, more jobs, more energy sustainability and more economic growth, which is especially important for us in this time of war, a time of ordeals for our society, for our entrepreneurs, for our businesses, surely for the entire European continent. There is an updated Priority Action Plan for enhanced implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area for the next two years. This includes further integration of Ukraine&#x27;s economic sectors and the EU market. This means industrial visa-free regime, Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the EU roaming zone, further transport and trade liberalization, and other quite practical things. Our people, our communities, Ukrainian businesses and businesses across the EU should feel an increase in their opportunities. And a real strengthening of Europe. Because the stronger our institutions are, the more practice we have, the more practical cooperation we have, the more results integration produces in Europe, the more guarantees we will have to protect Europe from any attempts by any enemy of Europe to destabilize or destroy our lives. So I wish you all today fruitful work and mutual understanding, which should always be the case between true colleagues. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must do everything we can so that next year we will be able to pray with thanks for the obtained salvation from evil - Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address to the participants of the National Prayer Breakfast in the United States</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-02</span></div>
  <p>Dear President Biden! Vice President Harris! Dear members of Congress! Your Majesty King Abdullah! Each and everyone who has faith! I am glad that for 70 years this tradition of prayer breakfasts, which was started during the time of President Eisenhower, has been preserved to this time. This is a symbol that despite any, even the worst, circumstances, the best in people still prevails, and prayer continues. If you recall the Psalms of David, you will pay attention to how often they ask the Lord to hear the prayer. We never know whether our prayer has come close to perfection, and whether the Lord heard it. And that&#x27;s why in harsh times – when we lose loved-ones; when people lose their children, which is the worst thing; when life is at risk; when a criminal war is conducted against your people; – faith may stagger. It happens that people think that God doesn&#x27;t hear and will not hear prayer. And it is important for us, as leaders of nations, to resist despair. &quot;But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high!.. I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me; Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear!&quot;. These words – at the beginning of the Book of Psalms, and their determination balances the doubts, that are found later in the Book. Because this is confidence in the Lord, who hears and who sees what is in a person&#x27;s heart. Millions of Ukrainians are asking for the expulsion of the invaders from our homeland, and so – for the restoration of peace. We believe in God. We do not allow despair. Thanks to the bravery of our soldiers. Thanks to the help of friends of freedom in the world – thanks to President Biden and all of you – the leaders and people who help. And we have that chance! A chance to drive-out the evil that came to our land under the Russian flag. &quot;We have a chance – a chance to make hope and history rhyme&quot;. These words were said at the prayer breakfast last year. This year, we see in concrete actions – in our joint actions with you – how this chance is realized. We have been standing against evil for almost a year. We are united, as we have not been for a long time. And we are brave – our heroic soldiers have already hit evil on the battlefield. Did it happen only due to the efforts of just people? Or were our prayers heard by God? None of us is allowed to know. And this is one of God&#x27;s best incentives for people. One of the best stimuli is that majestic silence, in which the human heart turns to God in prayer. When He gives a person the opportunity to become better. When He enables the actions of people to rhyme their own hopes with their own history. Does He help us with this? I&#x27;m sure He does. But people&#x27;s actions are needed – you have to wake up to say that the Lord is sustaining you. And I thank you all, America, thank you all, our friends in the world, for waking up together last year! We stand together. And we must do everything we can together so that next year – on the first Thursday of February – we will be able to pray simply with thanks for the obtained salvation from evil. May the Lord protect you all! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>We in Ukraine need to speak with one voice to the world on defense supplies and increase pressure on Russia - address by President Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-02</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today there was no shortage of statements and comments throughout the day, no shortage of news, especially in the diplomatic sphere. That&#x27;s why today&#x27;s report is brief. I will start with something that has not yet been reported. Today, I held a meeting of the Staff, for the first time in a dual format. First, the traditional full composition of the Staff. We reviewed the situation at the front, Russia&#x27;s attempts to increase pressure in Donbas. The issue of supplying the army. Training of personnel and other issues of constant attention of the Staff. And then, in the afternoon, an additional meeting of the members of the Staff in a narrow format. For a particularly important conversation. We will not leave any aggressive action of the invader without our response. The enemy is at a specific stage when Russia&#x27;s strategic defeat is already clear. But tactically, they still have the resources to attempt offensive actions. They are looking for options to try to change the course of the war and are trying to put the potential of all the territories they still control in the service of aggression. We have to continue what we are doing: strengthen our resilience, be absolutely united in our aspiration to provide our army and all defenders with the necessary weapons and equipment - we in Ukraine need to speak with one voice to the world on defense supplies. We also need to tangibly increase global pressure on Russia every month. The enemy must come out of this stage much weaker than they anticipate in the worst-case scenario. This is a difficult task for us. But we must accomplish it. We also continue our fight against the internal enemy. I am grateful to the Security Service of Ukraine, the State Bureau of Investigation, the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office and all those who are involved in the cleansing of our country. New steps will follow. Today, in the framework of negotiations with the President of the European Commission and members of the European Commission Board, we have reached very important mutual understandings. That only together a strong Ukraine and a strong European Union can protect the life we value. That Ukraine needs unwavering and full support in its defense against Russia. And that we must, through our further integration, give energy and motivation to our people to fight despite any obstacles and threats. I believe that Ukraine deserves to reach the beginning of negotiations on EU membership this year already. And I thank Mrs. President of the European Commission, her colleagues and our friends in the EU for their tangible support on the path of integration and in protecting our country and people. This includes military, financial, energy and social support. And these are the changes by which we ensure more interaction between our institutions - institutions of Ukraine and the EU. Tomorrow is the second European integration day of the week. The Ukraine-EU Summit will take place. We are preparing. And one more thing. Today I took part in the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC. This is an annual event that brings together the most powerful representatives of the American state and society. President Biden was there, as well as senators and members of the House of Representatives, leaders of religious communities and various political communities. I urged them to do everything we can and as we must in confronting the Russian evil, so that the power of our actions could complement the power of our prayers. Prayers for salvation from evil, for victory over the invaders, and for peace for all our people - in all municipalities of free Ukraine. I thank each and every one of our warriors! All soldiers and sailors, sergeants and foremen, officers and generals! To everyone who is resilient! I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! May all those who pray for our victory be heard! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are doing everything for our soldiers to receive modern tanks as soon as possible – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-03</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Another Ukraine-European Union summit took place today. It was held in Kyiv, our capital. We have quite specific agreements with our partners on how Ukraine will become even closer to the European Union. This morning in Ukraine, like many others, began with an air raid alert. This day, like many others, was spent in extremely brutal battles at the front. But all the same, this evening we can say that Ukraine is moving towards its goal. We&#x27;ve preserved Ukrainian freedom. We&#x27;re protecting the values of Ukraine. And we will achieve the goals of our state. European goals of our state. Today, there was a lot of confidence in this during the summit. We spoke and are already speaking as members of the European community. And we are working to fix this de jure. What exactly did we agree on today? There is an understanding that it is possible to start negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union this year. The partners also understand that this year, as last year, we have to continuously strengthen the defense support of our country and the pressure on Russia, in particular the sanctions pressure. We talked today about the tenth EU sanctions package, which is currently being prepared. There are our proposals for this package – we announced them to our partners today. We discussed changes in the institutions of our state, which we are implementing. And which we are still preparing to implement. Financial cooperation was discussed. Of course, we discussed the restoration of infrastructure, primarily social and energy. Also, the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan, what needs to be restored now. I thank the European Commission for the decision on EUR 1 billion, which will be sent specifically to Fast Recovery. We are preparing for greater integration of Ukraine into the internal market of the EU – it means more income for Ukrainian companies, more production and jobs in our country, and more income for state and local budgets. That is, it is what makes Ukraine really stronger. And for me, it is very important that there are specifics regarding such areas as, for example, replacing the children&#x27;s boarding school system in our country with another one. More civilized and friendly to children who, unfortunately, do not have parental care. Children should have a family. Raising children in family-type orphanages is definitely much better than the old boarding school system. We will make this reform together with the European Union. An appropriate office will be created to be responsible for this reform. And preliminary agreements regarding this reform have already been outlined. I have already reported on the various arrangements regarding our Peace Formula. These are specific ten points, the implementation of which will definitely make it possible to restore our territorial integrity and security, not only of Ukraine but also of the whole of Europe and the international legal order. That is, to restore everything that Russia&#x27;s aggression is destroying. Today, the European Union officially supported the Ukrainian Peace Formula. This was recorded in the final statement of the summit. And we agreed on concrete assistance from the EU in implementing our Peace Formula. This is a significant diplomatic achievement. And we are doing everything to make Russia&#x27;s aggression suicidal for it. The situation at the front remains very difficult, especially in Donetsk region. I thank all our soldiers who withstand the harsh pressure of the occupiers and who clearly and completely fulfill the task of defending our positions. And who, even in such difficult conditions as on the front lines now, bring Ukraine good news. In particular, I thank the 10th mountain assault brigade for successful counteroffensive actions in Donetsk region! Thanks to the fighters of the 54th separate mechanized brigade – for their bravery and true Ukrainian resilience in the battles for Donbas! The 81st separate airmobile brigade and the 66th separate mechanized brigade – I thank you, guys, for the protection of Luhansk region and steel strength! And I would like to single out our National Guardsmen – the 3rd operational brigade of the National Guard. Guys who successfully destroy enemy aircraft in Donetsk region. Thank you! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps us defend ourselves from the occupier! Thank you to everyone who strengthens our international positions and helps get weapons for Ukraine! Today, I spoke with the Minister of Defence of Poland in Kyiv – he, together with other partners and the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, took part in the third meeting of the states that are members of our tank coalition. We are doing everything to ensure that our soldiers receive modern tanks as soon as possible. And today, the United States announced another large package of defense support for our country. I thank President Biden, all friends of freedom in Congress, and every American for this tangible support! Now, we must work together to deliver this aid to Ukraine as quickly as possible. And one more. There are other sanctions decisions of the National Security and Defense Council of our country against those who work for Russian aggression. The decrees on the implementation of the decisions of the National Security and Defense Council have already been prepared. And separately, I thank the employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBI, the National Police, and the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office for taking new steps to restore justice after the actions of those who did not understand that in public positions one should work only for the interests of the state. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>To preserve all elements of our stability is to guarantee victory – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-04</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today, we have good news. Another 116 Ukrainians were released from Russian captivity. Of them, 114 are privates and sergeants, and two are officers. Soldiers of our army, the National Guard, territorial defense, Navy, border guards, and the State Emergency Service. We are constantly working to bring home all our people held in Russian captivity. And I&#x27;m happy every time it succeeds. I thank our entire team that prepares exchanges, the Coordinating Staff of the Defense Intelligence. Budanov, Usov, Yermak, Klymenko, Maliuk, Lubinets – I thank everyone! Thanks to everyone who helped. Of course, it is worth mentioning Denys Monastyrsky... He participated in preparing this exchange. And his death is really a big loss for our country. Since February 24, our team has managed to return totally 1,762 Ukrainian men and women from Russian captivity. I also thank all those involved in helping these people after their return. Everyone who treats, restores documents, helps solve problematic issues of those released from captivity. It reflects the basic meaning of what we do. We restore and protect the normality of life for our people in a free country. I spoke today with Rishi Sunak, Mr. Prime Minister of the UK. A very important conversation. We prepare pivotal things with him. I thanked the Prime Minister and all the British people for helping our country. Now, in the UK, our guys have already started training on Challenger tanks. It&#x27;s a good vehicle. And it will be a big thing on the battlefield. Together with our partners, we do everything daily to ensure that our soldiers have sufficient strength to defend against the terrorist state. We also discussed other promising things that can strengthen our defense. The issue of the threat to the international Olympic movement, which arose due to the weakness of the international sports bureaucracy, due to those who are trying to actually allow Russia to use sports for propaganda, was separately touched upon. I am glad that the world hears our position that the Olympic principles must be unequivocally protected from the terrorist state. Today, I signed the relevant documents to take another step to protect and cleanse our state from those on the side of the aggressor. There is a request from the Security Service regarding persons with records that they have Russian citizenship. Tomorrow, another legal step will be taken to implement the sanctions decisions of the NSDC. And we are working to synchronize our sanctions decisions with partner jurisdictions. The enemies of the free world have no right to use the free world for their own interests. And one more thing. During the 346 days of this war, I often had to say that the situation at the front was tough. And that the situation is getting tougher. Now is that time again. A time when the occupier throws more and more of its forces to break our defenses. Now, it is very difficult in Bakhmut, Vuhledar, near Lyman, and other directions. But now, as every day of these 346, the resilience of our soldiers decides everything. Our resilience! It&#x27;s not about the efforts and plans of Russia. It&#x27;s about the courage and determination of our soldiers. The effectiveness and speed of all who support and help to support our defense forces. The attentiveness and persuasiveness of all those who defend Ukraine&#x27;s international positions. The strength and unity of our people – all those who work for our victory, and all those who support our heroes and the Ukrainian state. To preserve all elements of our resilience is to guarantee victory. Glory to all our soldiers! Thanks to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The NSDC decision on sanctions against Russia&#x27;s nuclear industry has been put into effect, and this is not the last decision on this industry - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-05</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we have another sanctions step by our country against the terrorist state. The NSDC decision on sanctions against Russia&#x27;s nuclear industry has been put into effect. This is not the last decision regarding this industry of theirs. The point of our steps is also to bolster the efforts of our diplomats to extend global sanctions to this part of the Russian aggression machine. Russia is the only country in the world that allows its military to shell nuclear power plants and use NPPs as a cover for shelling. Russian missiles have repeatedly followed trajectories over Ukraine&#x27;s nuclear facilities. The terrorist state uses the nuclear industry as one of the elements of foreign expansion. To put pressure on other states. To create respective threats to the sovereignty of other states. All of these are sufficient reasons for Russia&#x27;s nuclear industry to be subject to global sanctions. And we are working on this with our partners. We also continue our diplomatic marathon to prevent the Kremlin from using world sports and the Olympic movement for its propaganda. Representatives of a terrorist state should have no place at the Olympics and international tournaments. Ukraine has sent respective letters to the companies that support the International Olympic Committee the most. These are large international companies that are definitely interested in ensuring that their reputation and support are not used for war propaganda. We have already begun preparing for the events of the coming week, which could become quite significant. We are preparing decisions and negotiations that should strengthen our warriors, provide Ukraine with more international support and more weapons. Both public and non-public formats of work are planned. I would like to express my special gratitude to those involved in the recovery from the power accident in the Odesa region. Restoration works are ongoing around the clock. As of today, hundreds of thousands of people in the Odesa region are without electricity supply. And of course, before the Russian terror, there were no such problems with electricity in Odesa and other regions of the country. Now, extraordinary efforts are needed to ensure the normal operation of the energy system. I am grateful to the power engineers, repairmen, officials - each and every one who is working to restore normal technical capabilities of electricity supply and to preserve our generation. By the way, this week we have reached some important agreements with our partners regarding our energy sector. In particular, the European Union is willing to support Ukraine with electricity supplies. I thank our partners for this. We are also stepping up cooperation in the supply of energy equipment. We also have extremely successful examples of energy saving initiatives. For example, just this week alone, people have already received the first million of LED lamps in exchange for energy-consuming incandescent lamps. More than 800 thousand applications under this program are already in Diia, which means it is as convenient as possible. When we fully implement the program - which is 30 million LED lamps - it will result in significant savings in consumption. I am thankful to Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, for supporting this initiative. Separately about the frontline. There are already many reports that the occupiers want to do something symbolic in February. To try to avenge their last year&#x27;s defeats. We see this increased pressure in various areas of the frontline, as well as pressure in the information field. It is very difficult in the Donetsk region - there are fierce battles. But no matter how hard it is and no matter how much pressure there is, we have to withstand it. We have to use and we do use every day and every week to reinforce our defense at the front, to strengthen our international position, to increase pressure on Russia and to give our people new opportunities to get through this difficult time. We have no alternative but to defend ourselves and win. I am grateful to each and everyone who is focused on strengthening the state! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps our state! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Good motivation plus good training equals the ability of our defense forces to regain what belongs to Ukraine - President&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-06</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. There are many issues. The key is actions on the frontline. In the Donetsk region and other directions. Particular attention is paid to Bakhmut. To our defense. To the occupier&#x27;s attempts to surround the city and break the defense there. We are countering them. I am grateful to every warrior who ensures counteraction with his resilience! Today, I would like to commend the warriors of the 54th and 93rd separate mechanized brigades, the 15th separate battalion of the 128th mountain assault brigade. Thank you, warriors, for your bravery and steadfastness! For the resilience Ukraine needs so much. Today at the meeting of the Staff we also discussed the supply of ammunition to our warriors. Artillery is one of the key factors. As always, the Commander-in-Chief and the commanders of the directions delivered reports. The head of intelligence reported on the occupier&#x27;s current plans. We are also strengthening our management positions. In a number of regions - especially in the border and frontline regions - we are appointing managers with military experience. Those who can prove themselves in the most effective way in the defense against the current threats. I will inform you about each such decision. In general, it is worth noting that we will combine the experience gained by our people in defending Ukraine - military experience - with specific managerial work in positions in local and central government. Today I have heard reports on the situation in Odesa and the region - the one related to the liquidation of the consequences of the energy accident. All services, all officials are working, everyone is involved. The repair work has already yielded part of the required result, and generators and power equipment are being delivered to the region and the city. As of now, there are power outages in a large part of the Odesa region. We are doing everything we can to provide electricity to people. Once again, I thank each and every person involved in this work. Today we have very tragic news from Türkiye and Syria. There was a powerful earthquake there. There are many casualties. Thousands of homes have been destroyed. My sincere condolences to Mr. President of Türkiye Erdoğan, as well as to those in Syrian society who have lost loved ones, who have lost their homes. Ukraine immediately responded and offered Türkiye support in the rescue operation. And one more thing. The formation of new brigades of the National Guard, police, and border guards - the Offensive Guard - continues. The beginning is powerful. The process will be continued. I thank everyone who has shown interest in the formation of brigades. I thank everyone who has applied! Good motivation plus good training equals the ability of our defense and security forces to regain what belongs to Ukraine. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to each and every one who works for our country! Glory to everyone who helps! Today, by the way, we have a very important decision from Norway - the five-year aid package for our country in the amount of NOK 75 billion. This is an extremely significant contribution to our victory, which we are preparing. A joint victory of all those who really value freedom and value life. I thank all Norwegians and Mr. Prime Minister personally! Thank you to all our partners! Thank you, people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are working on all enemy scenarios and defending the state - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-07</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on this day - another day of our defense. First. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has approved the new Head of the Security Service of Ukraine on my submission. I consider such a path to the appointment a signal to all government officials and employees of our law enforcement agencies. Vasyl Malyuk has been the Acting Head of the Service for some time. He passed the test of war. He proved his effectiveness. He was appointed. I am grateful to the people’s deputies of Ukraine for their positive vote on the candidacy of Ihor Klymenko for the post of Minister of Internal Affairs. It is important that the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is an element of the overall defense and security system, has quickly received a leader who has been defending our country since the first minutes of the full-scale invasion together with everyone else. Now we have people who have gained experience in such a war. They have clear results in their work for the state that is fighting for its people and its independence. There should be more such people on posts of various levels in central and local government. The relevant appointments have been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regional administrations will be headed by specialists who have real experience in defending the state right now. Today I met with the German Minister of Defense, who has arrived in Kyiv. The topic of our conversation is obvious. We are doing everything for our skies to be clear, for our warriors to have powerful tanks and for our artillery not to be inferior to that of the occupier. I thank Germany and all partners for the respective support. Today, as usual, I held several meetings with the military and a meeting with the head of intelligence. We are paying maximum attention to what the occupiers are preparing. And to what our warriors need to effectively resist – in all directions. The Donetsk region and the east, where the situation is the hottest – I mention them every day in such addresses. The south sounds less often, although the strategic meaning of these directions is no less significant. And we are strengthening the state along the entire perimeter. And today I want to praise the warriors in two directions. Our border guards who are fighting in Donbas. For their daily bravery and resilience in battles. For the results. Luhansk and Kharkiv border guard detachments - I thank you guys! I am thankful to all our defenders who defend the north of our country! Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Volyn. Operational and Strategic Group &quot;North&quot;. Every direction matters. We are working on all enemy scenarios. We are defending the state. Today I met with the ambassadors of our United24 charity platform - our athlete Elina Svitolina and French director Michel Hazanavicius. Michel has joined the ambassadors and will help us with rebuilding. This is our first United24 voice in France, and I believe it will be a powerful one. I was pleased to hear that our state charity platform has already managed to accumulate almost $300 million from ordinary people and companies from over a hundred countries. I spoke with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. I expressed my condolences. I told him about our steps to help the people of Türkiye pull through this ordeal. Ukrainian rescuers have already left for Türkiye to bolster the rescue operation after the earthquakes. I hope they will be able to save as many lives as possible. Thank you to everyone who saves lives! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Combat aircrafts – for Ukraine, wings – for freedom – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to both Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-08</span></div>
  <p>The people of the United Kingdom and their honorable representatives! All the people of England and Scotland, of Wales and Northern Ireland! Of all the lands which have been home to brave souls since Europe came into existence! I have come here and stand before you on behalf of the Brave. On behalf of our warriors who are now in the trenches under enemy artillery fire. On behalf of our air gunners and every defender of the sky who protects Ukraine against enemy aircrafts and missiles. On behalf of our tank-men who fight to restore our Ukrainian border. On behalf of our conscripts who are being trained now, including here in Britain. Thank you, Britain! And who will be then deployed to the frontline – skilled, equipped and eager to win. On behalf of every father and every mother who are waiting for their brave sons and brave daughters back home from the war. Mister Speaker! You may well remember as roughly more than two years ago we met with you here in the Parliament. It was a great honor for me. We enjoyed tea, we talked a lot about our people, our countries, the British and Ukrainian political traditions. Mister Prime Minister! Rishi! When we had our meeting earlier today, I said to you I would tell a story in my address to the Parliament. A story about my feelings on my first visit to London as president in autumn 2020. The programme was packed. Royal Highnesses William and Catherine. Buckingham Palace. The aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy. Westminster. Downing Street. And, of course, the War Rooms. There is an armchair in the war room. The famous Churchill’s armchair. A guide smiled and offered me to sit down on the armchair from which war orders had been given. He asked me – how did I feel? And I said that I certainly felt something. But it is only now that I know what the feeling was. And all Ukrainians know it perfectly well, too. It is the feeling of how bravery takes-you-through the most unimaginable hardships – to finally reward you with Victory. Ladies and Gentlemen! I thank you for your bravery. Thank you very much from all of us! This applause is for you! London has stood with Kyiv since day one. From the first seconds and minutes of the full scale war. Great Britain, you extended your helping-hand when the world had not yet come to understand how to react. Boris, you got others united when it seemed absolutely impossible. Thank you! You all showed your grit and character back then. Strong British character. You didn&#x27;t compromise Ukraine. And hence you didn&#x27;t compromise your ideals. And thus you didn&#x27;t compromise the spirit of these great Islands. Thank you very much! Our countries knew different times. Our nations defended freedom in the Second World War. The iron curtain divided us. Our people went through crises and growth, inflation, and periods of social losses and social gains. It was tough but we always found strength and stamina to move ahead and achieve results. This is the bedrock of our and your traditions. Ukrainians and Brits defeated the fear of war and had the time to enjoy peace. No matter what we encountered on different stages of our and your formidable history, you and us and the whole mankind achieved similar result – evil lost. We will always come out on top of evil. This lies at the core of our – but also your – traditions. However, the horizon never stays clear for a while. Once the old evil is defeated, the new one is attempting to rise its head. Do you have a feeling that the evil will crumble once again? I can see it in your eyes now. We think the same way as you do. We know freedom will win. We know Russia will lose. We know the Victory will change the world! And this will be a change that the world has long needed. The United Kingdom is marching with us towards the most important victory of our lifetime. It will be a victory over the very idea of the war. After we win together, any aggressor – big or small – will know what awaits him if he attacks international order. Any aggressor who will try to push the boundaries by force. Who will inflict destruction and death on other peoples. Who will try to endure his dictatorship at the expense of other people&#x27;s blood in criminal and unprovoked wars, as the Kremlin does. Any aggressor is going to lose. Ladies and Gentlemen! We have already achieved remarkable results. And we must make every effort to turn our achievements into the foundations of the future global security architecture. The world needs your leadership, Britain, just as it needs Ukrainian bravery. When the full-scale invasion began, we, together with you and the US and other allies, formed a true coalition of friends. This is very important. You were among those very few who had helped before the large-scale invasion began – exactly as it will be necessary every time in the future to prevent aggression from happening. Your help was preventive. We must take these principles of preventive aid to those, who are threatened with aggression, and preventive sanctions – against those, who threaten aggression – as basic principles of the world anti-war policy. We created a coalition of NLAW and Javelin that stopped the advance of the Russian army from the first day of the invasion. We built a coalition of artillery rounds and a coalition of air defense, which allow us to save the lives of civilians, our women, children and elderly, in our cities from Russian atrocious occupation and missile terror. We put together a powerful sanctions coalition. Your leadership in protecting international legal order through sanctions against a terrorist state – cannot be questioned. And we have to steadily continue along this way until Russia is deprived of any possibility to finance the war. Most importantly, together with the G7 we brought about a coalition of values. A coalition that protects the rule-based world order and human rights. A coalition that will work in such a way, that over time there will simply be no gray areas in the world in which human life does not matter. In order for it to be so, there must be justice. Anyone who invests in terror must be held accountable. Anyone who invests in violence must compensate those who have suffered from terror, aggression or other forms of state violence. Our proposals for the creation of a Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and a Special Compensation Mechanism, which will compensate war losses at the expense of Russian assets, are based on such principles. Justice is one of the ten elements of the Peace Formula proposed by Ukraine and supported by Britain. I thank you for your readiness to invoke the Formula! As I already mentioned, Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in Britain. In particular, to operate &quot;Challengers&quot;, your main battle tanks. It’s a tank coalition in action, and I thank you, Rishi, for this powerful defensive step - for tank assistance. The coalition of long-range missiles is the latest of all. It will allow us to make the evil completely retreat from our country by destroying its hideaways deep in the occupied territories. And it&#x27;s not just about weapons. We proved together that the world truly helps those who are brave in defending freedom. And thus, paves the way for a new history. A history of a world that knows how to be quick in help. Who knows how to be effective in defense. Who knows how to remain principled in dark hours. Who implements its treaties and arrangements in good faith. Who does not allow perpetrators to enjoy impunity. Who knows how to overcome veto when it is abused. Who knows no fear. And who knows how to win. This shall be the new reality of the free world! I’m sure of that. However, evil is still around today and the battle continues. Yes, we know how it is going to end and how we are going to feel on the day victory comes. Everyday we continue to pay with lives, pain and tears for bringing the victory closer. With the lives of our heroes, whom we lose in battles. With the lives of our heroes who take life and death risks every day to save as many of our soldiers and civilians as possible. Today, I will have the honor to be received by His Majesty the King. It will be a truly special moment for me. In particular, because I will convey to him from all the Ukrainians the words of gratitude for the support His Majesty showed to them when he was still the Prince of Wales. I also intend to tell him something that is very important not only for the future of Ukraine but also for the future of Europe. In Britain, the King is an air force pilot. And in Ukraine today, every air force pilot is the king for us, for our families. Because they are so few, they are so precious that we, the servants of our kings, do everything possible and impossible to make the world provide us with modern planes to empower and protect pilots who will be protecting us. I am proud of our air force. And I brought a present from them to you, Great Britain. Open, please. I will explain. It&#x27;s the helmet of a real Ukrainian pilot. He is one of our most successful aces. He is one of our kings. And the writing on the helmet reads: &quot;We have freedom. Give us wings to protect it.&quot; I trust this symbol will help us form our next coalition – coalition of the planes. I appeal to you and the world with simple and yet most important words: Combat aircrafts – for Ukraine! Wings – for freedom! Great Britain! You and us both struggle for peace, but instead we are forced to face the rage that seeks to deprive us of peace and everything else that is valuable in life. Unfortunately, it is in human nature to allow evil mature. It then stands up against humanity. It then destroys and kills. It launches aggressions and breaks people&#x27;s lives. You and us have already fought together against such evil. You and us already have the experience of defeating the evil that is generated by human nature. I am not saying there will be no more wars after this war ends. It is impossible to completely erase evil from human nature. Yet, it is in our power to guarantee with words and deeds that the light side of human nature will prevail. The side you and us share. And this stands above anything else. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Leaving the British Parliament two years ago, I thanked you for delicious English tea. I will be leaving the parliament today thanking all of you in advance – for powerful English planes. By the way, it&#x27;s almost five o&#x27;clock. God bless Great Britain and long live the King! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Russia is trying to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life; we will not allow that - President&#x27;s speech at the special plenary session of the European Parliament</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-09</span></div>
  <p>Dear Mrs. President, dear Roberta! I thank you for these powerful words and I thank you for your personal attention, an extremely important attention for Ukraine. I thank you for your integrity and energy, two qualities that we see invariably in the current struggle for Europe and whose combination is always a prerequisite for progress. Europe is fortunate that in this hall, in the largest parliament in Europe, the European Parliament, principled and energetic people are an absolute majority. I thank you. Dear representatives of Europe! Dear leaders of Europe! All of us, Europeans, each and every one of the hundreds of millions of people on our continent, combine these two statuses - representatives of Europe and leaders of Europe. This combination reflects what our Europe, a modern Europe, a peaceful Europe, gives to the world. European way of life. European path of life. European manner of life. European rules of life. When everyone matters. When the law rules. When states strive to be social and societies strive to be open. When diversity is a value and the values of the different are united by fair equality. When the borders are inviolable, but their crossing is not felt. When people believe in tomorrow and are willing to take to the streets to fight for their tomorrow. When there is only one single barrier between the president and the protesters, and that is fair elections. This is our Europe. These are our rules. This is our way of life. And for Ukraine, it&#x27;s a way home. Now I am here to protect the way home for our people. All Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women. Of different ages and different political beliefs, different social status, different views on religion, with different personal stories, but common European history with all of you. There is an attempt to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life by all-out war. But what for? For the destruction of the European way of life as such after the Ukrainian European way of life is destroyed. For each of all twenty-seven elements of the European way of life. The twenty-seven countries of the European Union. We will not allow that. This total war that has been unleashed by Russia is not just about territory in one part of Europe or another. Its threat is not only in the fact that there is a dictator with huge stockpiles of Soviet weapons and weapons inflow from other dictatorships, in particular the Iranian regime. In order to be able to wage this war, the Kremlin has been consistently destroying, step by step, year after year, what we see as the basis of our Europe. The sacred value of human life has been completely destroyed in Russia as well. No one matters to the authorities there, except those inside the Kremlin walls, their relatives and their wallets. For them, for the Kremlin, all others, all one hundred and forty million citizens are just bodies capable of carrying weapons - carrying weapons to Ukraine, carrying weapons on the battlefield, keeping others in line or being in line themselves. The rule of violence and obedience are the rules there instead of law. The Russian regime not only hates everything, any sociality and any diversity, but also deliberately invests in xenophobia and tries to make all the inhuman things that happened in the 1930s and 1940s part of the norm on our continent. But will it last forever? This is a question for all of us. The answer is no! No! Europe! We are defending ourselves against the most anti-European force in the modern world. We are defending ourselves. We, Ukrainians, are on the battlefield with you. I thank you for the fact that we are defending ourselves together! And we must defend ourselves! And this is important not only for European countries. Not only for the communities of Europe. No matter who we are, we always fight against contempt. Wherever we live, we always rely on good faith. Whatever we dream of for our children, for our grandchildren, the unconditional background for these dreams is peace - peace and security. Will all of this be possible if we do not defeat the anti-European force that seeks to steal Europe from us, from all of us? No. It is only our victory that will guarantee all of this - each of our common European values. Our imperative victory! Dear representatives of Europe! Dear leaders of Europe! Dear ladies and gentlemen of the parliament! Dear employees of the European Parliament and other European institutions! Dear journalists! Dear security officials, military! Police officers, rescuers! Dear municipal employees! Diplomats! Teachers! Professors! Scientists! Dear doctors, drivers and port workers! Farmers! Dear industrialists and workers of industrial enterprises! Owners of small and large businesses, banks! Dear power engineers and railway workers! Dear students, pupils! Trade union activists, representatives of non-governmental organizations! Dear directors and artists! Lawyers, judges, environmentalists, human rights activists! The fate of Europe has never depended on politicians alone. There should be no such illusion now as well. Each and every one of you is important. Each and every one of you is strong. Each and every one of you can influence our common result. Our common victory. This applause is definitely not for me. This applause is for gratitude – I want to thank everyone in Europe, in hundreds of cities and towns, who supported Ukraine in this historic struggle. Thank you! I want to thank you - everyone who has helped our people, our ordinary people, our displaced persons. Those who called on their leaders to increase support for the protection of these ordinary people. Who took to the streets, who asked questions, who spread the truth about Russian aggression. Who refrained from the temptations of Russian disinformation and who stand with us in the fight for life. In the fight for Europe. I thank you! I thank everyone who is helping Ukraine with vital supplies. Weapons and ammunition. Energy equipment and fuel. Thousands of things that are essential to survive this all-out war. I thank you, dear ladies and gentlemen of the parliament, and you personally, Roberta, for consistently defending the European way of life with your decisions. For consistently defending the Ukrainian European way of life. You have made bold decisions and strengthened the European ambition to be the home of justice and freedom. I recall the first days of the full-scale invasion, when Russia&#x27;s ambition to break us and the whole of Europe was still audacious. When Russian aggression was just beginning to break its teeth on our defense. Already then, on March 1, on the sixth day of the full-scale war, the European Parliament adopted a resolution supporting not just our country, but the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union for our country. It was a vision that motivated us to be resilient and stay on our path. Thank you. Today, at a meeting of the European Council, I will have the opportunity to personally thank the heads of state and government of Europe, whose decisions over the past year have allowed our continent to do what the previous wave of leaders thought impossible. Europe is finally freeing itself from destructive dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Europe is cleaning itself of the corrupt influence of Russian oligarchic business. Europe is defending itself against the infiltration of agents of the Russian special services, who have even considered Europe as a place to hunt for opponents of the Russian dictatorship already. For the first time in its history, the European Union is providing military assistance of such magnitude. And for the first time in history, I believe, it is preparing a positive assessment of internal reforms in a European country that is defending itself in this all-out war and at the same time - while fighting - modernizing its institutions. We are getting closer to the European Union. Ukraine will be a member of the European Union! A victorious Ukraine! A member of the European Union - a victorious European Union! Dear friends! Perhaps some of you have not experienced the full power of the European way of life before. But now, together, Ukraine and the EU countries have made our power evident. Why is this possible? Because we combine integrity and energy. We are all equal in representing Europe, and we are diligent as each of us is a leader of Europe in our own particular life. We do not rely on words - we act. We do not cower before the enemy - we stand. We do not waste time - we change ourselves and we implement changes. Europe will always remain free. As long as we are together and as long as we care about our Europe! Care about the European way of life. I thank you all! I invite you all to Ukraine! Glory to all Ukrainian men and Ukrainian women who are in combat! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must guarantee security of Europe - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the special session of the European Council</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-09</span></div>
  <p>Mr. President, Charles! Dear colleagues! Ladies and gentlemen, presidents and heads of government of Europe! I am happy to greet you all personally and to thank you all personally for your support for Ukraine, our people and our aspirations. The aspirations to live freely in a united Europe. I will repeat these words once again: freely and in a united Europe. It may sound routine and familiar somewhere. And somewhere else it means something completely different. I want to tell you now about just one episode. I think it is important. One of the many episodes of current life on our continent. Each of these episodes is designed to deprive us both of these fundamental characteristics. Freely and in a united Europe. I recently spoke with the President of Moldova, Mrs. Sandu. I informed her about what our intelligence has managed to intercept. A detailed Russian plan to undermine the political situation in Moldova. A Russian document that shows who, when and through what actions was going to break Moldova. To break the democratic order of this country and establish their control over it. I did not hesitate for a single minute when I received this document and heard about its origin. I immediately warned about all these threats. I warned Moldova to protect it. And each of you would have done the same, each of you. We don&#x27;t know whether Moscow gave an order to act according to this plan against Moldova. But we saw what they were going to do, and we recognized it as exactly what they had already tried to do against Ukraine and against other states, particularly in Europe. There is nothing new. You have seen other attempts at such Russian subversive and destabilizing activities. We, my friends, are protecting Europe from a regime that has proven that it has only one ambition: to destroy Europe&#x27;s freedom and to be an authoritarian master on the continent. Yes, for this regime, our common European home is just a space, just a territory with resources and assets that can be allegedly conquered or otherwise brought under control. So that they can dominate wherever they want and plunder or exploit whatever they want. Aggression, deliberate mockery of nations or artificially provoked crises... Russian air strikes or Russian disinformation attacks... Russian politicians or saboteurs... Russian dirty money and corrupt influence... Attempts to undermine the political or economic situation... Missile attacks, cyber attacks... Isn&#x27;t it too much? Russia has different tools. And these tools are not only against Ukraine, Moldova, the Baltic States, Poland, or those neighboring Russia. We saw this, in particular, in the Balkans. Unfortunately, we can see it again any time in any region of Europe, if someone in Moscow comes up with an idea to draw up another illegal violent or aggressive plan. A plan for new aggression - hybrid or direct. Will we always have time to defend ourselves? This is my question. We all need speed in decision-making and reliability! Dear colleagues! Here in Brussels, and in the European Union as a whole, everyone can feel the weight of two personalities. Everyone can understand why everyone respects Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet so much. In particular, their leadership created our current freedom and allowed Europe to become as united as we have long dreamed of. Now we need to add one component to our freedom and unity. A component without which everything else is fragile. This component is security. And if we manage to provide Europe with the security it needs right now and guarantee its reliability and durability, your names, colleagues, will be written in the history of Europe alongside the names of Schuman and Monnet. The European Union is already on the way to such security! Fundamental steps have already been taken. But we have to go all the way! I know we can do it. I thank each and every one for consistently becoming stronger during this terrible year, when Russian aggression has become the most intense. Europe is getting stronger thanks to your actions and decisions. And even when there were hesitations and disputes, you still found the possibility of these joint decisions. Strong decisions! I thank you for them. I thank you for understanding that there should be no gray areas anywhere in Europe. Not a single part of our continent that for some reason is closed off from the common European destiny. Which for some reason is left in danger. The course of further European unification is a fundamental security course. A free Europe today cannot be imagined without a free Ukraine. I thank you for the fact that we have jointly prepared Ukraine&#x27;s acquisition of the status of candidate for accession to the European Union. I thank you for jointly preparing a positive assessment of our transformation on the way to the European Union. I thank you for the fact that the launch of negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union this year will become another strong pillar of our common security. For the first time in its history, the European Union is providing such large-scale and consistent military assistance as we are receiving. Together with the appropriate leadership at the level of member states, this security interaction with Ukraine has created a historical example for any aggressor. An example of why one should not start aggression against Europeans. That is why Russian aggression must inevitably fail. As soon as possible! The sooner and stronger the return of freedom and the real power of European values to the entire territory of Ukraine, which remains occupied by Russia, is, the more reliable and lasting peace in postwar Europe will be. And I am grateful to all of you who help us. I am grateful to all of you who understand how much Ukraine needs such capabilities, artillery and ammunition, modern tanks, long-range missiles, and modern aircraft. And I am grateful to all of you who provide such military assistance! We must strengthen the dynamics of our cooperation more than the aggressor can mobilize its potential. I am grateful to every nation of Europe who feels that the Ukrainian people and the heroic Ukrainian warriors on the frontline, with appropriate support, are able to destroy the terror that Russia is carrying and any aggression, any aggressive actions against people and against Europe. I am grateful to you for your economic and energy solidarity. For helping us to maintain financial and social stability in Ukraine - even in such difficult conditions of a full-scale war. I thank you for all the financial and energy assistance packages you have provided us. And this is also about security. Not only the security of our people. It is about the security of the entire European community. Finally, Russian energy carriers will never again be a weapon against Europe. Finally, everyone in Europe saw how Russia really treats Europeans and the energy system on the continent, our markets, and our finances. For the Kremlin, all this is just an opportunity to wage wars. I thank you for your determination to gradually deprive the Kremlin of such aggressive capabilities. I thank you for the sanctions packages that have already come into force. But have they sufficiently limited Russia&#x27;s aggressive potential? This is a path that needs to be completed. We can analyze how these sanctions are working. So that they have neither the opportunity nor the desire to make efforts to destabilize any country in Europe or elsewhere. Or to provoke any crises – energy, migrant, you can see what is happening with grain, i.e. food crises, radiation crises. Think about it: Russia has created the threat of a radiation catastrophe in Europe! And the Russian nuclear industry is still free from global sanctions. Is this normal? I do not think so. There are steps that still need to be taken. For example, sanctions against the entire Russian missile and drone industry, the relevant part of the IT sector of the terrorist state. After all, Russian missile and drone terror will remain a threat until the source of the threat is destroyed. I believe Europe has this determination. And the last thing. Without which the kind of Europe we are defending is impossible. Justice. It is impossible to live without justice, and you do not see any future in this. There must be a tribunal against Russia for this aggression. There must be a compensation mechanism for all the damage caused by Russian terror. There must be fair accountability for Russian terrorists for everything they have done - from the destruction of the Malaysian Boeing in the skies over Donbas in 2014 to every other manifestation of this appalling terror. Thousands of victims of Russian terror and the memory of thousands of our warriors who gave their lives fighting this terror demand justice. When it is ensured, it will be another part of the security foundation of a peaceful Europe. Dear colleagues! Everything I have said today is already part of our Peace Formula or directly corresponds to it. Ukraine never wanted this war, never sought this or any other war. Ukraine never provoked it and always tried to maintain peace. You know this very well. History knows this very well. You know the potential of our Formula and our unity. I urge you to realize this potential to the fullest! Europe is free and will be free. Europe is united, and I am sure that we must do everything to make sure that Europe is united with an independent Ukraine, with an independent Moldova, with an independent Georgia, with independent Baltic states, with Poland and with all the other states that are members of our modern Europe. We must guarantee security to all European countries! Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today&#x27;s missiles are a challenge to NATO and collective security, this is terror that can and must be stopped - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-10</span></div>
  <p>Fellow Ukrainians! A brief report. Today, the enemy launched at least 70 missiles in another massive attack. At least 60 missiles were shot down. Their targets were civilians, civilian infrastructure. Unfortunately, there were hits. Unfortunately, there are victims. My condolences to the relatives and friends! Several Russian missiles flew through the airspace of Moldova and Romania. Another proof that terror does not know and will never know any borders. Another proof that the protection of Ukraine is the protection of the whole of Europe and the world, of every country that simply wants to live. Today&#x27;s missiles are a challenge to NATO, collective security. This is terror that can and must be stopped. Stopped by the world. And I thank everyone who understands this. I thank everyone who helps. And, of course, I thank our Air Forces, all our anti-aircraft fighters, everyone who protects Ukraine and our people. Another air alert is currently underway. And please pay attention to the alarms. Please stay tuned for official information. Take care of yourselves. We will defeat everyone! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>If Russian athletes are allowed to participate in the Olympic Games, it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the Russian Federation forces them to play along with the war propaganda - address by the President to the participants of the summit of the sports mini</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-10</span></div>
  <p>Our team had a very good visit to Great Britain. Then we had very good meetings in the EU and Brussels with all our partners. Thank you very much for your support and all your words and deeds since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia. But we have challenges every day. Ladies and Gentlemen! Another missile attack on our country has just taken place. This is our morning today. At least sixty-five rockets. All – against civilian infrastructure. This follows a night of air raid alert. Before this morning missile strike – an attack with deadly drones and rockets too. Their targets were power plants and power transformers – that is, the basis of normal life of people. Energy. If the Olympic sports were killings and missile strikes, then you know which national team would occupy the first place. And it&#x27;s not important – whether this national team would have its official flag, the state tricolor. Russian terrorists use different symbolics. The Russian military forced Ukrainians in the occupied territory of our country to wear a white armband. Allegedly not to be killed. But they were tortured and killed even with these white armbands. Russia uses certain letters of the Latin alphabet on flags of different colors – and all of them symbolize the genocidal ideology of rashism, whatever the specific color is used. It also happens that the Russian occupiers destroy normal life without any symbols at all – this is how the Russian aggression began. Our Crimean peninsula was occupied by Russian soldiers without any insignia. So, I want to ask you: if representatives of a terrorist state appear at international sports competitions or the Olympic Games, will it matter if they are there without their national symbols? The mere presence of representatives of the terrorist state is a manifestation of violence and lawlessness. Dear friends! I know you do not want to allow the Olympic principles to be distorted. It is a fundamental thing for Ukraine and, I believe, for each of your states – to protect the value basis of normal life that we cherish with you. Peaceful life! A life based on respect for different people. The Russian state has chosen the path of terror, and that is why it has no place in the civilized world. The world isolated Russia. To be protected. The Russian presence is being removed. To encourage an end to aggression and terror. This is the self-defense of the world – a world that takes care of its values and protects life. 228 Ukrainian athletes and coaches died during the year of Russian aggression against Ukraine! 228! And how many Russian athletes have spoken out to condemn the terror unleashed by their state? In fact, there is almost no such condemnation. There are only a few isolated voices that are quickly fading away. We know that many Russian athletes associated with the sport clubs of the Russian army and of security state agencies. Including athletes who applied for championships and the Olympic Games. We are aware that many Russian athletes have a military or other special rank. We know that Russia is trying to use any attention of the world to the Russians for war propaganda. If, God forbid, the Olympic principles are destroyed and Russian athletes are allowed to participate in any competitions or the Olympic Games, it&#x27;s just a matter of time – before the terrorist state forces them to play along with the war propaganda. Ladies and Gentlemen! Sports community! Each of us knows what the Olympic principles are. Terror and Olympism are two opposites. They cannot be combined. Probably someone wants the &quot;Schröderization&quot; of sports and the presence of a terrorist state – in one form or another – on the world&#x27;s sports fields. Probably someone wants to disregard the Olympic spirit in order to help Russia by manipulating the mere letter of the Olympic principles. However, we must protect life. We must protect our values. We must stop aggression and fight against those who choose the road of terrorism. We must safeguard the Olympic movement. I believe that we will! Ukraine has launched a marathon of honesty, and I urge you to join. While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of the terrorist state have no place at sports and Olympic competitions. And it cannot be covered up with some pretended neutrality or a white flag. Because Russia is now a country that stains everything with blood – even the white flag. It must be recognized. And this must be recognized, in particular, at the level of the International Olympic Committee. The International Olympic Committee needs honesty. Honesty it has unfortunately lost. Honesty that will help stop Russian terror and bring peace closer. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Let life win! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>It is always an honor for me to represent Ukraine, and I am proud of our beautiful and strong people – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-10</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! The fifth day of this week is coming to an end. In some ways, a very hard week, but a very meaningful one for sure. I want to emphasize a few things after the results of this week. He held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. It was a busy meeting. The situation on the front line was examined in detail, in particular in Donetsk region –Bakhmut and other hot spots. Tough areas. We reviewed the situation with the supply of weapons, the general situation with the defense of the state at the Staff meeting. We are already preparing for the new &quot;Ramstein&quot; – in particular, we talked about it. About new defense options that we should open for Ukraine together with our partners. The second important thing this week is our diplomatic marathon. London, Paris, Brussels – everywhere these days I spoke about how to strengthen our troops. There are very important agreements and we have received good signals. This applies both to long-range missiles and tanks, and to the next level of our cooperation – combat aircraft. But we still need to work on this. I was very pleased to hear and see that our boys in the UK are rapidly learning to drive the Challengers. I was very happy to see how eager the British were for us to win. All this is inspiring. I am grateful to the Prime Minister, the British Parliament and all British people. And, of course, His Majesty the King. A fundamental meeting was held in France with President Macron and Chancellor Scholz. The three of us had a conversation, and it&#x27;s the right conversation. It&#x27;s wrong to disclose its details, but we can say we heard each other. France – Ukraine, Germany – Ukraine. Partners have heard our position, our arguments. There will be more support. And I thank Mr. President and all the French, Mr. Chancellor and all Germans for that. Understanding that the protection of Ukraine is the protection of the interests and our partners is felt. Brussels. The meeting of the European Council and our special format of negotiations after the meeting. The negotiations with EU leaders not only within the framework of the European Council, but also within the framework of ad hoc meetings that took place after the summit. In general, I met with all the leaders of the European Union. And now, our joint task is to take all that we talked about and agreed upon and transform it into concrete delivery, concrete documents, and concrete new lines of cooperation. The third is the European Parliament. It was not just my address as the President of Ukraine, but it was a symbolic moment. A certain valuable summary of the path we have taken in relations with the European Union. And the beginning of the new stage. When Ukraine is no longer a guest or partner from outside the EU in the European Parliament, the European Council and other institutions of the European Union. When Ukraine becomes a full part of the European Union. This week I said many words of gratitude to our allies and partners – everyone who helps us. And now I want to say words of gratitude to you, Ukrainians. It is always an honor for me to represent Ukraine, and I am proud of our beautiful and strong people. You have heard and seen how Ukraine is welcomed. It&#x27;s what we all did together. It&#x27;s how you are welcomed. I&#x27;m proud of Ukrainian courage. I&#x27;m proud of Ukrainian resilience. I&#x27;m proud of Ukrainian effectiveness. I&#x27;m proud of all of you who fight and work for our country! Who supports the front and the state. Thanks to all of you! Of course, today, I want to mention our pilots, all our Air Force fighters, everyone who defends the Ukrainian sky. So far, unfortunately, we cannot shoot down all Russian missiles. But all those dozens of missiles that we shoot down every time during heavy airstrikes are hundreds of lives saved every time and it is saved infrastructure. That which gives life to the people. I thank you, Air Force! And we will do everything to ensure that you have modern and efficient wings! Historical results for Ukraine are always closer than they might seem. Glory to our troops! Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to everyone in the world who is determined to fight for freedom together with us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>State to continue modernization of institutions, procedures – address of Ukraine&#x27;s President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-11</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today, I started the day by visiting the Turkish Embassy. With condolences to the Turkish people after the terrible earthquakes. As of now, more than 21,000 dead are known. Debris removal continues. And, unfortunately, the death toll may be higher. The team of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine is currently working in Türkiye, helping with debris removal. The Embassy of Ukraine is finding out all the information about Ukrainians who could stay in the disaster zone. We share the pain of the Turkish people. And we wish all those affected a speedy recovery. In the afternoon, I held several meetings with representatives of the defense sector and law enforcement agencies. The topic is common to these meetings. It is the strengthening of the public institutions of Ukraine and the protection of institutions from any attempts from outside or inside to reduce their effectiveness and efficiency. This applies to various areas: both personnel policy, interaction between public institutions, and the clarity of how the public structures work. For example, at a meeting law enforcement officers presented a report on the detection and blocking of shadow schemes at customs. You have seen during these weeks appropriate investigative actions and detentions. The Security Service of Ukraine, the State Bureau of Investigations, and the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office have achieved significant results in protecting our country from those who worked for the aggressor state. There will be corresponding steps by the National Security and Defense Council, continuing our line of defense of the state. And all this activity is not only these or other episodes or these or other criminal proceedings. Not only what concerns certain individuals. And what concerns institutions. The state will continue modernizing the institutions, their processes and procedures. The clarity in the work of the public structures should be guaranteed not only by what depends on the people but also by the creation of transparency and accountability functionality. And I want to thank all the workers of our defense and security sector and all law enforcement officers who care about the state, who strengthen the state with their work, and who not only suggest how to enhance Ukrainian institutions but also give results in such strengthening. Of course, I want to thank our defenders of the sky for the result today. For another page of success in defending our state from Iranian drones used by Russia. I would especially like to mention the fighters of the 160th Odesa, 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, and the 302nd Kharkiv anti-aircraft missile regiment. Thank you guys! Thank you to all our soldiers for the latest results that Ukraine needs in terms of resistance and repelling enemy assaults in Donetsk region – near Bakhmut, Avdiyivka, and other directions. Thank you to the soldiers of the 80th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade, the 5th Separate Assault Regiment, the border guards, and the National Guardsmen, who are fighting together in Donetsk region. Air reconnaissance and intelligence, aviation, mortars, gunners, infantry, tankers, and anyone and everyone who helps. Thank you all! Glory to all who make Ukraine stronger, the enemy weaker, and our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Elements of the Russian system involved in the war must be isolated from the global system - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-12</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! This is another sanctions step by our state against the nuclear industry of the terrorist state. By my decree, I put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council to impose sanctions on 200 people working for the Russian nuclear industry. We are doing everything to make sanctions against the Russian nuclear industry part of global sanctions against Russia for the war. It is not easy. There is some resistance. But there was a time when other restrictions against Russia seemed difficult to implement as well. They did. Now they are already in place. For example, on oil and oil products from Russia. All elements of the Russian system that are involved in the war, in providing terror and financing aggression must be isolated from the global system. This will be done! This is all the more true for those who participated in the seizure and illegal actions at our Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia&#x27;s radiation blackmail of the world must be punished. This is also something we will be discussing at various diplomatic levels next week. This will be an equally important week for our international positions. We are already preparing for the planned communications and negotiations. We will not interrupt the diplomatic marathon we have launched to strengthen armed and other support for Ukraine for a single week. Today I would like to personally praise everyone who is restoring the energy capabilities of our country. Today and yesterday, the majority of Ukrainians spent without many shutdowns. Of course, unfortunately, there were still restrictions in some districts and cities. Where the degree of destruction is too significant. Of course, with the start of the new week, consumption will increase, and therefore there will be outage schedules. But the very fact that we can have such calm days in terms of energy after the constant terrorist attacks with missiles and Shaheds, after the massive missile attack this week proves the professionalism of our power engineers and the extraordinary dedication of everyone who works on the provision of our energy system. I am grateful to all Ukrainian power engineers, all repair crews, employees of the State Emergency Service, utility workers, regional and local authorities who helped. And to the businesses that have been involved in the relevant work. We must realize that this is not yet a decisive victory on the energy front. Unfortunately, there may be new terrorist attacks from Russia. There may be new restrictions if there is new destruction and consumption growth. But today and yesterday are yet another proof that by working together and helping each other, Ukrainians are doing great things. So let&#x27;s stay united! Do not waste a single day or a single week! All for the sake of Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who works for our country! Glory to each and every one who is in combat! Glory to all those who are defending Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Chasiv Yar, Maryinka, Avdiivka and all other directions in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as along the entire frontline! Resilience, unity and mutual support are our strength! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every new result achieved for Ukraine means a shorter time to victory - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-13</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very busy day - both in terms of domestic issues, primarily defense and security, and foreign policy. I held a meeting of the Staff. We heard reports from the direction commanders, the Commander-in-Chief, and intelligence chiefs. The defense of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the south of our country, Odesa and the region. Constant attention is paid to the supply of weapons, ammunition and everything that gives our warriors strength and resilience. Today I introduced the new heads of the Security Service of Ukraine and the Ministry of Internal Affairs - Vasyl Malyuk and Ihor Klymenko. I am confident that both of them are in the right place. Where they are really useful for the state. I thanked them for being at war from the first minutes of the war. Together with their colleagues. They have already achieved significant results in protecting the state, and they will definitely have even greater achievements in their new positions. Today I spoke with the Prime Minister of Norway. This country is one of our largest partners. I expressed gratitude for the new defense package and for the new unprecedented support program from Norway, which is being prepared for approval and will last 5 years - 5 years of stable support for Ukraine. Norway truly helps us strengthen ourselves on land, in the sky and at sea. Thousands of Ukrainian lives have been saved thanks to timely and powerful Norwegian assistance. But the energy, political and other support from our Norwegian friends is also important. Thank you again for all this help! I spoke with the President-elect of the Republic of Cyprus. I congratulated him on winning the election. We discussed the relations between our countries and agreed to work together for the sake of common security - of our countries and of the whole of Europe. I spoke today with the President of the Philippines for the first time in the history of bilateral relations. I thanked him for the support in international organizations, and we agreed to develop our relations. It is extremely important for Ukraine to have meaningful relations with the entire Southeast Asian region and with every country in the region. We will move on in this direction. In general, Ukrainian diplomacy has a clear task: to reach all regions of the world where our position is not yet well represented, to make Ukraine and Ukrainian interests understandable to all those states and nations with whom we do not yet have stable ties. This concerns Asian destinations, as well as Africa and Latin America. Today, I held a meeting with the international bloc of the government and the Office to discuss the interim results of our diplomatic marathon. Our activity is really high now. We reach new agreements almost every day. Last week was particularly intense. But the key thing is to ensure that each agreement reached turns into concrete supplies for our defense, concrete interaction between states and concrete signed documents as soon as possible. We have reached an important mutual understanding with the UK on long-range weapons and the need to speed up the delivery of tanks. We have a good agreement on artillery and ammunition. We have a full understanding of each other&#x27;s positions on modern fighter jets. And I thank all our British friends, I thank Mr. Prime Minister Sunak for the work that has been started, particularly in the aviation sector. Our talks in Paris with President Macron and Chancellor Scholz were also significant. The three of us spoke very frankly, and this allowed us to find a common understanding of the prospects in this war. I think this will make it much easier to resolve defense issues. We have a common vision of the path to victory. I would also like to separately thank Mr. President and Mr. Chancellor for their consolidated support of our European integration. The visit to Brussels was unprecedented for the history of our relations with the European Union. For the first time, there was such attention to Ukraine, for the first time, there was a meeting with all European leaders at once, and a series of conversations with European leaders that were as dynamic, meaningful, and free of excessive politicization as possible. With each leader, we discussed only those things that are important for our relations and for the European community as a whole. There was not a single empty conversation. I thank all our partners for this. I would also like to emphasize the negotiations with Poland. With President Duda, when I was returning to Ukraine. And I had a separate conversation with Prime Minister Morawiecki in Brussels. We discussed tanks and other weapons for defense on the ground; aircraft and other means of defense in the sky. We discussed the situation in the region in general, the prospects for this year... As always, we have full understanding with our Polish brothers. And it is very important that we enjoy clear support from European institutions and European leaders for our goal of preparing for and starting negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the EU this year already. Now, more than ever, it feels like Ukraine&#x27;s European goals are becoming a reality. Finally, there are more real achievements than political declarations. For decades, Ukraine and the European Union have been moving towards this. These weeks, our diplomatic marathon continues. Tomorrow is another Ramstein. We are preparing for it. And we are working to ensure that all our negotiations are reflected in the defense decisions of our partners both at Ramstein and during the time period before February 24. New bilateral talks and meetings are also planned. We are preparing. And we are making this intensity of diplomatic work the new minimum standard for Ukraine. I thank everyone who works for our country! I thank everyone who helps! I thank everyone who is in combat! I thank all our warriors who prevent the occupier from surrounding Bakhmut, who destroy the enemy in the Vuhledar sector, leaving nothing but scorched marks on the ground, and who hold our other crucial frontline positions. Following these days, I would like to praise the warriors of the 66th separate mechanized brigade, 95th separate air assault brigade and 81st airmobile brigade who are extremely steadfast in defending the Luhansk region. And also the warriors of the 5th separate assault regiment who are heroically defending the Donetsk region. Thank you all, guys! Let&#x27;s remember: every new result achieved for Ukraine means a shorter time to victory. In the evening, I signed decrees awarding our warriors. 186 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state decorations. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We have got regular strong decisions on protecting our country and strengthening our warriors - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-14</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is the day of another Ramstein, a meeting of the group of military support for Ukraine. 54 partner countries. This is the ninth such meeting. We have got regular strong decisions on protecting our country and strengthening our warriors. Our partners have confirmed more air defense systems, more tanks, more artillery and shells, and more training for our military. As we heard today, Ukraine must be successful. And here we agree: there must be success. Of course, not everything about Ramstein can be reported in public. Much of the agreements and discussions should be kept behind closed doors of the Contact Group. But I can say for sure that the basic trends remain unchanged. Ukraine and its partners are doing everything together to make the terrorist state lose. And to make it happen as soon as possible. We can see now that the Kremlin is trying to squeeze all possible aggression potential out of Russia. They are in a hurry. Because they know that the world is still stronger, but it takes time to accumulate its strength. Therefore, speed is very important. Speed in everything. In decision-making. In the implementation of decisions. In delivery. In training. Speed saves lives, speed brings back safety. And I thank all our partners who realize that speed is important. I thank all of our American friends for their leadership and systematic coordination of the Ramstein meetings, as well as for the personal participation of Mr. Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense of the United States, and Mr. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in the meetings. Today I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, who was on a visit to Ukraine. The topic of our conversation was also, so to speak, &quot;Ramstein-based&quot;. First of all, defense support, new weapons for Ukraine, and new sanctions against Russia. I thanked Canada for the support it has already provided. And we discussed in detail with the Minister what is needed now to continue to oust the occupier from the Ukrainian land. We are actively preparing for the foreign policy events of the second half of this week. We have to go through the week in the tone set by Ramstein for it. Accumulating results for Ukraine. Today we have very good news from a group of our rescuers working in Türkiye. On the ninth day after the devastating earthquake, they managed to rescue a woman. Our SES rescuers pulled her out of the rubble and handed her over to doctors. It is very important not to lose hope under any circumstances and continue to fight for life. I am thankful to our entire rescue team! And, of course, today, just as every day, I stay in touch with our military, with the commanders. I had several meetings. The situation on the frontline, especially in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, remains extremely difficult. It is literally a battle for every meter of Ukrainian land. We must understand the significance of these battles. Every meter won there is a defense of our entire country. Every day that our heroes endure in Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Maryinka and other cities and communities in Donbas means the reduction of Russian aggression for weeks. That is where the unprecedented destruction of Russian potential is taking place now. Everything that the enemy loses in our Donbas, it will not be able to restore. And this is exactly the potential of Russian aggression that the leadership of the terrorist state expected to destroy our entire Ukraine. Glory to everyone who is now fighting for Ukraine! We are doing everything to give our warriors more weapons, longer-range weapons and greater might for the offensive we are preparing. And... today is Valentine&#x27;s Day. I sincerely congratulate everyone who is in love on this holiday, on this day. And I congratulate all those in love with Ukraine! Together we will win! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Any attempts by Russia to retake the initiative must be thwarted - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-15</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today we had a day that can be called preparatory. Preparatory for international events that will take place tomorrow and the day after. These days. As always, Ukraine&#x27;s position must be heard. Hence, we are preparing our position so that it is guaranteed to be heard. This day was also preparatory for a longer-term perspective. Defense issues, economic issues - both with an eye to the spring of this year. We have to ensure that this spring it is truly felt that Ukraine is moving towards victory. This applies to the training of our defense forces, the supply of weapons for our country and our strategic initiative in the war. Any attempts by Russia to retake the initiative must be thwarted. And I am confident that we will do so. The enemy is already losing so many of its people, so many of its forces, that it will soon be difficult to find, for example, a &quot;marine&quot; throughout Russia. And our task is to make sure that there is less and less desire there to keep Ukrainian territories under occupation. The liberation of our land is the goal we are working on every day. Today I held an economic meeting, also to prepare for spring. We discussed many issues. All of them relate to the economic recovery of Ukraine, creating economic opportunities for our people and industries. The agricultural sector – there is a very acute issue of humanitarian land demining. An interagency working group has been set up at the Cabinet of Ministers level to ensure that this activity is intensified – the clearing of soil from mines and unexploded ordnance. The government is preparing new significant steps to deregulate the Ukrainian economy. Business will benefit from simplification in dozens of areas, including the abolition of various bureaucratic permits and licenses. Steps are also being prepared to create jobs. Every job in our country now is a contribution to our resilience. And it is a way to bring our people back to Ukraine. The relevant details will be presented at the government level. Of course, we also had a very meaningful conversation today about European integration. We are doing everything to prepare the start of negotiations on EU membership. In particular, this was discussed during the visit of the Prime Minister of Sweden. It is Sweden that currently holds the EU Presidency, and we have both the necessary leadership and the necessary will to start membership negotiations this year. Ukraine feels the support of its partners in this, and I am grateful for it. Today we also spoke in great detail with Mr. Prime Minister of Sweden about further defense assistance, about weapons for us, for Ukraine. Our defenders are very much looking forward to the Swedish Archers, one of the most powerful artillery systems. And Archers will definitely help our warriors. Today I spoke with the President of Azerbaijan. I thanked him for the sincere desire for peace for Ukraine, for the humanitarian support for our country and for his wise view on the protection of international law. We agreed to cooperate in global institutions. And, as it has become a tradition every evening... I want to thank our warriors. To each and every one of them, who with their resilience and bravery on the frontline enable us to prepare our next defense steps. The 54th separate mechanized brigade named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa, the 10th separate assault brigade &quot;Edelweiss&quot; - thank you guys for the effective defense of the Donetsk region! The 25th separate airborne Sicheslav brigade, the 81st separate airmobile brigade and the 95th air assault brigade - thank you guys for defending the Luhansk region! Every day of your defense now allows us to prepare the future liberation of our cities and communities. We cannot leave a single chance to all the occupiers. And we will not. I thank everyone who helps our country! Glory to each and every one who is in combat! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are already confident that at the end of the road we will remain free and gain peace - speech by the President of Ukraine at a special session of the Storting </h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-16</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much! Mr. Prime Minister, Jonas, thank you for your kind words about Ukraine and for your leadership. This is what strengthens both our countries. And of course, I am grateful for the globally important precedent of resilience that Norway is setting. Ladies and Gentlemen! Mr. President of the Storting, members of the Parliament and the Government! Mr. Prime Minister! People of Norway! I am grateful to all of you for your principled and unwavering support. For the thousands of Ukrainian lives saved. For the things that became a reality due to the Norwegian assistance to our defense. I first addressed the Norwegian Parliament and all Norwegians on the 35th day of this war. Today is the 358th day of the war. And the main difference between March last year and February this year is confidence. Confidence that the free world will not betray the values of freedom. Confidence that Ukraine will not be left alone with such an enemy. Confidence that Europe will not give up any of its rocks to the enemy, as every part of our Europe makes us all stronger. Norway&#x27;s contribution to this confidence is truly historic. You help us with air defense systems, and this protects our cities from Russian terror. You help us with anti-tank weapons and artillery, and this saves Ukrainians from the expansion of Russian torture chambers and abuse on our land. You help us with the restoration of energy after missile strikes and Iranian drone strikes, and this returns people to normal life. And now you are setting a precedent of long-term financial support for a state that defends its independence and the right of every nation to live in accordance with generally recognized international norms. Why is this precedent important? Because it not only gives you the feeling that you have a tomorrow. It gives you the feeling that tomorrow, just like today, you will have a reliable partner by your side. A partner who values life and people as much as you do. A partner who, like you, understands the importance of social stability. A partner who, like you, wants states to border not with aggressors but with good neighbors. Ukrainians and Norwegians are exactly such partners. We share the same values, and therefore we are united in defense. United in defense, and therefore united in future victory. And it will be a solid basis for the security of everyone in the world if your view of resilience becomes a guideline for other defenders of freedom. Ladies and Gentlemen! The support program that Norway is approving for our country, which sets a precedent for guaranteed sustainable support for the struggle for freedom, is designed for five years. No one on earth today can say what exactly will happen during this time. Five years. But we all understand exactly what will not happen. Russia will not defeat our unity - all of us who value freedom. The Kremlin will not make intimidation and terror the new norm for Europe. A terrorist state will not convince anyone that killing and robbing is better than living by the law and cooperating. And the Russian flag will not take root in the occupied territory of Ukraine. This is just as sure as your NASAMS protect our skies. I especially thank you for them! Because every day and every night we need air defense - it is a matter of life for Ukraine. Just one example: last night there was another Russian missile attack, 36 missiles. Against people again, there were victims again. But still - half of the missiles were shot down! And we are doing our best to ensure that one hundred percent of Russian terror ends in failure. We&#x27;ve come a tremendous way since my first appeal to Storting. And we still have to work hard to win, this is obvious. We still have a lot to do on the battlefield in Ukraine. And we still have to remain vigilant in order not to lose the unity of the world and to constantly strengthen the resilience of our partners. But we are already confident that at the end of the road, no matter how long it may be, we will remain free, we will definitely gain peace and we will retain respect for ourselves and for each other. Because we do not betray our principles, and this is the most important thing. We are acting systemically and in a long-term manner, and this is the most effective manner. Thank you, Norway! Thank you again, Jonas, Mr. Prime Minister, and thank you to everyone here for your support! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Keeping the situation on the frontline under control and preparing for any escalation steps of the enemy is a priority for the nearest future - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-16</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We have another piece of good news - we are bringing Ukrainians home from Russian captivity. Today we have brought back 101 people more. Most of them are Mariupol defenders, privates and sergeants. Navy, border guards, National Guard, ground troops, territorial defense. One civilian is the first deputy mayor of Enerhodar. I am happy for each of the more than a hundred Ukrainian families whose sons, brothers and husbands are returning. I am grateful to our Coordination Center, our entire team. Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Malyuk, Klymenko, Lubinets. And to everyone who is helping. Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff, and all the commanders of the operational directions took part in it. We heard detailed reports about the situation in each of the areas and the prospects for each of the operational directions. The supply of weapons, the supply of ammunition, training of our military. The enemy&#x27;s plans and capabilities. The potential of the Ukrainian response. Keeping the situation on the frontline under control and preparing for any escalation steps of the enemy is a priority for the nearest future. Moving forward with the further liberation of our land is a priority that we are carefully preparing. I had several important international conversations today. Exactly those that strengthen us. Of the things I can talk about publicly, I will mention the following. In the morning, I took part in a meeting of the Norwegian Storting, the parliament. They were just working on a historic support package for our country - for five years. More than 7 billion dollars. Norway is one of our most consistent and energetic partners. This applies to weapons as well, in particular the powerful NASAMS air defense systems. And many other aspects of support. But what is especially important is that this package of long-term, five-year support is an example, a benchmark. This is the level that other partners see. I once again thank all Norwegians for the assistance packages already provided to our country and for today&#x27;s decision. This is what really strengthens us. Today I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel, who was on a visit to Ukraine. We had a detailed conversation. I informed him about the situation on the frontline and our efforts on international platforms. In particular, I presented our Peace Formula and invited Israel to join its implementation. I met with the Leader of the British Labour Party and the Official Opposition. The British are a sincere and strong ally of ours, they are among the strongest defenders of global freedom. It is important that representatives of the entire political spectrum of the United Kingdom see with their own eyes what the Russian war has brought and how Ukrainians are determined to win and rebuild their country. It was a meaningful and useful meeting today. I once again thank Britain for all the support provided to our people, for all the defense power that we have gained with the help of the British. I spoke with the President of Kazakhstan. First and foremost, we talked about cooperation on international platforms - what we can do together for the sake of our common interests and the protection of international law. I thanked him for the humanitarian support for Ukraine. And a few other very important things. Today our Lithuanian brothers celebrate the 105th anniversary of the restoration of the Lithuanian state. This is a holiday whose importance is especially felt right now, when we, together with Lithuania, are defending our freedom and our right to Europe. I want to emphasize this again now: Lithuania started helping us even before Russia started its full-scale invasion. And I constantly feel this support - both from Mr. President Gitanas Nausėda and from the Lithuanian state as a whole. I am absolutely sure that we will celebrate the days of our statehood together many more times - and always in our free countries. I have just taken part in the opening of the 73rd Berlin Film Festival. As always, it is principled. As always, it is relevant. And this year, it is as much in solidarity with Ukraine and our struggle for freedom as possible. This year&#x27;s blue and yellow colors of the Berlinale&#x27;s symbol, the famous bear, are really touching. And powerful. Together we prove that even a bear can be the right one. I am grateful to all the filmmakers who did not remain indifferent and support us with the power of their works and their influence. I thank all the organizers and participants of the festival. And of course, I am thankful to Sean Penn, who was in Ukraine on the first day of the full-scale invasion and who has been only more determined to support Ukrainians since then. And praising our defenders, honoring our heroes. Paratroopers of the 79th separate air assault brigade and artillerymen of the 55th separate artillery brigade - thank you guys for your bravery and precision. Thank you for your skillful and steadfast defense of the Donetsk region. Zaporizhzhia direction - I thank all the warriors of the 129th separate Kryvyi Rih territorial defense brigade. They firmly hold the line of defense. And, of course, I thank our Air Forces, all the air defense fighters and pilots who ensured the result in shooting down the Russian missiles today. 36 missiles and drones during today&#x27;s attack. Half of them were shot down. We do our best to ensure that our warriors are capable of shooting down the enemy&#x27;s entire arsenal in our skies. I thank everyone who helps! Glory to each and every one who is now in combat! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Culture and cinema cannot be outside politics when it is a policy of aggression - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants and guests of the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear organizers, participants, friend of Ukraine Sean, and guests of the 73rd Berlin Film Festival! Ladies and Gentlemen! In preparing for this address, I remembered a phrase that you are all well familiar with. “Break the fourth wall.” An imaginary border between the one who is on the screen and a viewer. At the same time, cinema is able to overcome other walls and barriers existing in the world. Both real and ideological. It is enough to mention the story of the great German director Wim Wenders. In my opinion, in a certain sense of the word, he broke the Berlin Wall two years before its actual fall. In the outstanding film Der Himmel über Berlin, where the divided city is united by Angels flying freely over the wall. At that time, Wenders could not even imagine that one day, in basically the same place, he would open the 50th Berlinale. Where once there was a wall and emptiness – now life is booming and the heart of the Berlinale beats. And it seems very symbolic to me. For many years, Potsdam Square was &quot;cut through&quot; by the Berlin Wall. Formally, it divided West and East Berlin. It divided the free world and the totalitarian one. And it is not only about state borders on the map. The wall divided different worldviews, philosophies, different values. Today, Russia wants to build the same wall in Ukraine. A wall between us and Europe. To separate Ukraine from its own choice and its own future. A wall between freedom and slavery. Between the right to life and missile attacks. Between progress and the ruins that Russia leaves behind. A wall between civilization and tyranny. A logical question comes up: On which side should culture and art be? Are they still out of politics? Russia has been waging a full-scale war against us for almost a year. For almost a year it has been shelling and destroying peaceful cities, for almost a year it has been killing people, killing women and children, threatening the world with a nuclear attack, provoking food, energy, environmental, migration and other crises on all continents. Can art be outside of politics? Should cinema be out of politics? This is an eternal question, but today it is again extremely relevant. I think about it when I hear strange calls for representatives of Russian sports, read about strange invitations to perform for Russian musicians, discussions about scientists, cinema, and culture in general. I was thinking about this... last night when Russia launched yet another massive missile attack on Ukraine. 36 rockets and Iranian drones! Culture and cinema can be outside politics. But not when it is a policy of aggression. Not when it is a policy of mass crimes, murders, terror, the desire to destroy other countries and other peoples. When it is a policy of total war. That is, the politics of today&#x27;s Russia. Under such circumstances and at such times, art cannot be neutral. Cannot be &quot;out&quot;. Culture makes choices in times like these. Culture chooses the side. Or speaks out in different ways fighting and standing against evil. Or – ovelooks and remains silent – and, in fact, helping the evil. When art is indifferent and its voice is not heard, in this silence the loud speakers of evil sound stronger and more convincingly. Of course, in a global sense, cinema cannot change the world. But it can influence and inspire people who can change the world. A good movie evokes emotions. Cult cinema causes change. In humanity&#x27;s struggle against any evil, there are always two voices – truth and propaganda. For a while, propaganda can muzzle the truth. But it is not able to win completely. If art does not stop the struggle and understands that standing aside means being close to evil. The Berlinale made its choice. And confirmed the truth of my statement. Professing the principles of openness, equality, dialogue without borders and the cinema from all over the world, the Berlinale made a choice. Institutions and persons supporting the Kremlin and films made with Russia’s support are not admitted to this year&#x27;s festival. We appreciate it and are grateful for it. This is really important. This is not a formality. This is justice. We are grateful for Ukraine&#x27;s support, attention to Ukraine, solidarity with Ukraine. Proof of this is the official badge for participants and guests of the Berlinale – the Golden Bear, which this year has become blue and yellow. These are the colors of Ukraine. The colors of our flag. We will do everything to return him to his rightful place and free all our lands. Your support in this is important and invaluable to us. Now there are thousands of kilometers between us. But we are side by side. We speak different languages, but there is complete understanding between us. Only a virtual border separates us. But there is no wall between us. Ladies and Gentlemen! In 1951, the first Berlin Film Festival took place. You all know the slogan and purpose of the first Berlinale. This is the Showcase of the free world. Today, Ukraine is the Fortress of the free world. A fortress that has stood for almost a year. A fortress that protects itself, Europe and the world. A fortress that cannot fall. A fortress that will definitely stand. And will win. I believe that you will all be convinced of this, after seeing our &quot;Superpower&quot; – the superpower of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We have to liberate Ukraine and Europe, because when the Russian weapon shoots at us, it is already pointed at our neighbors – address by the President at the Munich Security Conference</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-17</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! I greet all of you and would like to remedy one injustice right away. This panel discussion is called ‘David on the Dnipro’. I consider it as a rightful respect to Ukraine and to everything our people are doing. But this year determination was shown on different banks – and not only of the Dnipro. Spree and Seine, Thames and Potomac, Vistula and Tiber – David is now all of us, he is a whole free world. David is everyone who felt that there is no alternative but to defeat Goliath, who came to destroy our life. Being David is fighting. And we are fighting. Being David is having a sling to win. We do not have yet the David&#x27;s Sling from Israel. But I believe it is just temporarily. Now I would like to thank for the powerful support and mighty weapons. I thank Olaf and Emmanuel who are present here on this panel. I thank all our partners present here in Munich – the United States, Britain, all the countries of the EU and all from the world. I am grateful to everyone who gives the sling to Ukrainian David, thanks to which Russian Goliath has already started to lose his ground. We saw it last year. And he will definitely fall. Already this year! We can make it. All of us together – just as David did. We can make sure that there is no alternative to our victory. But then – there should be no alternative to our determination. To the determination of all of us – on Dnipro and on Spree, on Seine and on Thames, on Potomac and on Vistula, on Tiber, on Danube and on Jordan – and in every part of the world where freedom is valued more than the mercy of a tyrant. Last year, when I was here in Munich at the Conference, I was looking for such common determination. Ukraine was clearly telling the world: we will fight for ourselves if Russia starts a full-scale war. I wanted to hear from the world: Ukraine, we will be with you. Unfortunately, I heard it only after Russian missiles struck our land. Already after the Russian tanks started moving. Already after Putin destroyed all alternatives, leaving just one – who will win? He or us? In fact, you have already responded with the name of this Conference’s panel discussion. Goliath has no chances. But, unfortunately, he has potential. Unfortunately, he tries to buy additional time for his aggression, trading with the world. Unfortunately, he can still destroy many lives. That is why we need to hurry up. We need speed. Speed of our agreements. Speed of delivery to strengthen our sling. Speed of decisions to limit Russian potential. There is no alternative to speed. Because it is the speed that life depends on. Delay has always been and still is a mistake. While we negotiate how to strengthen our defense with modern tanks, the Kremlin is thinking about ways to strangle Moldova. While we are trying to convince that Ukraine needs modern combat aircraft, the Kremlin has already convinced the Iranian regime. The result is not only lethal Iranian drones in Ukrainian skies. But also something, with which the Kremlin paid for it. Are you sure it&#x27;s just money? Or, maybe, the world will face the &quot;enriched Iranian regime&quot;? And to what extent – 90%, 92% or 100%? I am sure none of us wants to let the region of Middle East and the Gulf taste it. While we spend weeks to agree on new sanctions against Russia, the terrorist state is looking for ways to adapt to the restrictions already in place – through parallel imports, shadow fleet of tankers and the like. Where shall we see the impact of this illegal profit of Russia? In the efforts to corrupt your political systems and international institutions. In attempts to destabilize your social life and in disinformation campaigns against your people. In escalations in those regions that are sensitive to you. What awaits, for example, Libya, Mali or the Central African Republic, while Moscow has the power? What awaits Syria? Nothing good. Just like many other nations. So, you will have no rest as well. So, it&#x27;s not just about Ukraine. The point is that Goliath must lose. There is no alternative to this! Because the Kremlin can break the security and peace of all, who are now represented here in Munich. Delayed decisions of the world are a resource Putin&#x27;s dictatorship lives on. It&#x27;s been that way for years. The longer the talks about the enlargement of the European Union dragged on, the more destructiveness the Kremlin brought to the – then – gray zone between the European Union and Russia. The louder it was said that it was necessary to wait before Ukraine was allowed to enter NATO&#x27;s &quot;open&quot; door, the more aggressive Russian policy became. The longer the silence on Crimea on the global agenda lasted, the more vigorous Russian revanchism became. The more the world argued over what sanctions and when to impose against Russia, the more shameless the Kremlin&#x27;s ambitions became. The longer we in Ukraine, in Europe and in the world had no unity, the more illusions Russia had. Now all this is being corrected. Just like last year, I now propose to act immediately. But unlike last year, now I have the most convincing argument – our achievements. Can we deter Russian strikes? Yes. Can we protect our cities from Russian missiles? Definitely. Can we liberate our land? There are one thousand eight hundred and ninety-one proofs of this. That is exactly how many cities, towns and villages we managed to liberate from the Russian occupation. Can we restore security in the Black Sea region, and food security in the world? The Black Sea Grain Initiative and the humanitarian initiative “Grain from Ukraine” are convincing. Is it time for Ukraine to be a full-fledged part of the European Union? Most Europeans support membership for Ukraine. We have already gained the status of a candidate country. We are already preparing to start membership negotiations. We are already united with the European economy, logistics and energy. There is no alternative to Ukrainian victory. There is no alternative to Ukraine in the EU. There is no alternative to Ukraine in NATO. There is no alternative to our unity. Hence, there is no and should not be any alternative to completely get rid of Russian aggression. To liberate the land, to liberate people. Because every city, town and village that remains under occupation means people staying in captivity. May people be the subject of compromise? No. We have to liberate Ukraine – and Europe. Because when the Russian weapon shoots at us, it is already pointed at our neighbors. May Europe be the subject of compromise? No. We have to liberate from Russia&#x27;s aggressive potential every international institution and every sphere of the world economy. Because only then there will be a chance for freedom to pass-through our border – further to the East. May freedom be the subject of compromise? No. And it’s a rock-solid No. I am confident that we can gain victory not only over Putin, but also over putins; not only over putins in Russia but all around the world. Wouldn&#x27;t this be proof of the power of the idea of freedom? It will definitely be. Ladies and Gentlemen! Determination is never abstract. David defeated Goliath not by the power of conversation, but by the power of his actions. By courage and sling. Courage is what we have. There is enough of it. Not only in Ukraine, but in our entire coalition of victory. The sling should get stronger. Right now. So that the next year we would gather here in Munich for the first security Post-War Conference. Under the condition of free Ukraine. Free Europe. And the free world. Olaf, Emmanuel, all our friends – I think you&#x27;ve got me right. I thank you for your attention! You – Davids of the free world! We, united Davids shall prevail over putins scattered all over the world! Glory to everyone who is now on the battlefield! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The aggressor must always lose, every state in the world must have the right to independence and respect – address of Ukraine&#x27;s President to participants of 44th Regular Meeting of Conference of Government Heads of Caribbean Community</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Prime Minister Davis, dear colleagues! Each and everyone in the Caribbean Community who loves peace and enjoys living in line with the law! I am honored to address your community of states for the first time. It is a special mission – to thank you for your support of Ukraine and the international order. An order that is vital for everyone in the world – both for the largest and the smallest ones. Because all in the world are equal and deserve to live with dignity and independence. Ladies and Gentlemen! The modern world is always on the edge – between the force and the law. The force – like in the old days of inhuman invaders. And the law – to maintain freedom and security for everyone. Whatever part of the world you take, anywhere it is noticeable. This confrontation, this brink that defines destinies of nations. Ukraine values the power of law. Just like you. And we defend ourselves from those who believe in nothing else but brutal force. This is the meaning of the war that’s happening now, now and here – in Europe. But the war here is affecting not only our region. All-in-all, this is a war in which the world will cross that line between the force and the law. Ukraine is fighting to make the law prevail. The UN Charter – to prevail. The international conventions and treaties – to be effective. So that everyone in the world has guarantees – guarantees that no crime of aggression will be committed against him. Ladies and Gentlemen! As of this day, about eighteen percent of Ukraine&#x27;s territory is occupied by Russia. One hundred and nine thousand forty-five square kilometers. Is normal life possible there, on that part of our land? No, it is not. Human life is worthless there. This is what Russia has brought to our land with its occupation. Russia&#x27;s domination means no human rights but the rule of militarized gangs. When Russia comes, it means that repressions and murder come. If the Russian flag appears, it means that torture chambers and total looting will appear. And when we finally manage to liberate the land from Russian forces, we see a humanitarian disaster area where everything has to be rebuilt. One hundred and nine thousand forty-five square kilometers of human rights violations, looting, humiliation, and death. Death. This is the reason why we are fighting so hard to drive Russia out of our land. This is the reason why we are trying so hard to restore the power of international law. This is the reason why it was Ukraine, who proposed the Peace Formula, that can end this war and restore everything destroyed by the Russian aggression. Our Formula covers all aspects of damages: from damage to international law – to environmental harm. Russia is not just burning down cities, killing people and stealing property. Russia is destroying the environment. Russia is shelling chemical plants. Its aggression brings about destruction and flooding of coal mines. Mines and hostilities in the Black Sea resulted in death of tens of thousands of living creatures. All these damages are to be fixed by our Peace Formula. And I know that Russian propaganda – and in your region in particular – draws a completely different picture of what is happening on our land and in Europe. But I warn you that if Russia, God forbid, is successful in any way, the balance in the world will change. Not in favor of law. But in favor of violence. The aggressor must always lose. The law must always prevail. The truth must always spread throughout the world. And every state in the world – big or small – should have the right to its independence and to the respect of all others for this independence. These are the principles of Ukraine. These – I know, are your principles. I thank you for being on the side of the law. I thank you for your efforts to bring stability to your region and the world. But real stability is possible only when we all together protect the world from state thuggery. So I encourage you to further cooperation! Next week we will present at the UN General Assembly a resolution on a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace in Ukraine, and hence the restoration of the full force of the international rules-based order. Your votes matter! I have presented the Peace Formula and your leadership can help to implement it. And of course, I invite you all to visit Ukraine. Peace is a value that must be cared-for together! Thank you for your attention! And I wish you a lasting peace! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are doing everything to strengthen our soldiers, inspiring the world with courage and resilience – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! A brief report on this day. Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, visited Kyiv. A leader who greatly helps us protect freedom. The leader of the state helping us a lot to protect Ukraine and all of Europe. The Netherlands is among Ukraine&#x27;s leading partners. It is manifested in defense, political, and legal support. Today, we had, as always, meaningful negotiations with Mark. There will be more weapons for our soldiers, more pressure on the terrorist state, and more opportunities to restore justice. Together with the Netherlands, we are working to punish Russia for this aggression and to compensate for the damage caused by the war. There is already a concrete solution – to place a register of damage in The Hague. It is the first important element of the future compensation mechanism. I am sure we will reach other necessary solutions. Russia will be held fully responsible for everything it has done against Ukraine and the Ukrainians. Today, I had the honor to present our people, our defenders at the opening of the Munich Security Conference. It is one of the most important international gatherings, and this year&#x27;s conference represents the significant powers of the modern world. Thanks to all of you, Ukrainian men and women, who defend our state, there is no Russia in Munich. The key message of Ukraine at the security conference is obvious: we must do everything to ensure the collapse of Russian aggression already this year. It is possible. It is necessary. But it is possible if Ukraine gets the weapons necessary for this. Therefore, our diplomatic marathon continues without a break – since my visit to Washington in December. A tank coalition has already been created for Ukraine, the taboo on the supply of long-range missiles has already been lifted, there have already been new successes in strengthening our artillery, and the world has already heard how necessary the creation of an aviation coalition for Ukraine is for global security. I talked about it today with Prime Minister Rutte, and during the week – with other leaders. I will continue these negotiations next week. I will continue consolidating support for our country&#x27;s initiatives in the UN General Assembly. Next week we will introduce an important resolution, and today I presented its essence, particularly to the heads of government of the Caribbean Commonwealth. Ukraine always bases its foreign policy on respect for all participants in international relations. All nations are equal and deserve an independent life, and peaceful cooperation with other nations. This principle of ours meets understanding in all parts of the world. And I thank every state, and every nation that supports Ukrainian efforts to stabilize international relations. And the most important thing. Of course, today, like any other day, I am in constant contact with the commanders. I held a meeting with representatives of the defense sector. We are doing everything to strengthen our soldiers on the front line – our heroes who inspire the world by how they bravely and steadfastly defend the freedom of Ukraine, our land, our values. Again and again, I mention our fighters who defend Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade, 95th Separate Assault Brigade, 25th Separate Airborne Brigade – I thank you, soldiers! I thank you all who hold our positions at the front, who destroy the enemy, and who give us all faith in victory. The victory of Ukraine! Glory to each and every one who is now in battle! Thank you to everyone who helps our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We receive strong signals from our partners regarding inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression and terror against Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-18</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! This day began with preventive power outages in some regions of our state. These outages were required to protect networks and generation facilities from another Russian missile attack. And we end this Saturday without power outages in almost the entire territory of our state. Apart from Odesa, where the recovery continues after previous attacks and some areas where networks were damaged by wind gusts. Most of the territory of Ukraine has power. Most of our people have electricity. And it is another confirmation of our resilience, the strength of Ukraine, and the colossal work that was and is being done by many people. By everyone who restores and protects energy. By all who work to strengthen our air defense. By all our partners who help. And, of course, by all our soldiers who defend Ukraine every day, every night as part of the Air Force and all our defense and security forces. I thank everyone who contributed to the defense of the Ukrainian sky and the state&#x27;s power system! It is a very important result for Ukraine. The result we achieved together. We will continue doing everything possible and impossible to give Ukraine more air defense, more guarantees of stability, and more protection against any Russian strikes. Today in Germany, in Munich, the security conference continued. It is the second day of the conference. Not just the Ukrainian topic, but the topic of Ukrainian victory, which we are approaching, obviously dominated the discussions at the conference today. There are important statements by world leaders in support of our state, and there are signals about strengthening weapons for our defense. It applies, in particular, to long-range missiles, other weapons, and the long-term support of Ukraine. I am grateful to all the leaders for their support and for what happened yesterday. And for the signals that were in Munich today, which confirm that Russian aggression will have only one final, namely the defeat of the terrorist state. And we must do everything to hasten the Russian defeat. The pressure of the world should be such that Russia does not have time to find new forms of terror. By the way, our diplomatic work next week will be devoted to exactly this – the acceleration of our movement. We expect important news for Ukraine, and for our security. Traditionally, I want to thank all those, who are currently defending the state on the battlefield. I especially want to note everyone, who defends Donetsk region. The most brutal and principled fighting is going on there. Confrontation, which a lot of what we are preparing for the near future depends on. I thank the paratroopers of the 79th Separate Assault Brigade, the Marines of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade, the infantrymen of the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, the soldiers of the 55th Separate and 27th Rocket Artillery Brigades. Thanks to all of you, warriors! Today, there is something to celebrate with the fighters who fight near Zaporizhzhia. The 128th Separate Brigade of the territorial defense forces – thank you, guys, for repelling the attacks! I would also like to thank all our signalmen today for their excellent service! To everyone who efficiently and timely provides logistics for our troops, and to all the Support Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Thank you! Thank you to everyone for whom the stability of Ukraine and our positions are an unconditional personal, official, and professional priority! And one more. This week, we received strong signals from our partners, and concrete agreements regarding the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people. Every Russian attack on the city of Kharkiv and the region, Sumy region and Donetsk region, Khmelnytsky, our Nikopol, and every corner of our state will have concrete legal consequences for the terrorist state. It applies not only to the evil that Russia has brought since February 24 but also since 2014. We remember everything. We remember Ilovaisk, we remember the Donetsk airport. We remember the battles for Debaltseve – especially today – and every attack on our people. We have to restore justice. We will do it. Let&#x27;s do it together with the whole world. Glory to each and every one who is in battle today! Eternal memory to all those, whose lives were taken by this war, this state – Russia – and its aggression! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I want our people to have predictability now, and a feeling that Ukraine is moving towards its goals - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-19</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! It’s Sunday today, yet it is a very meaningful and, as always, a working day for the state. I held a meeting of the Staff in a new format, an expanded one. Both the Commander-in-Chief and the commanders of directions reported, there were also reports directly from the frontline. We are leveling the situation, doing everything to prepare our actions planned for the future, for the nearest future. And also what is being done now, these days, on the frontline. The Commander-in-Chief reported on the overall situation at the front, with a special emphasis on mobilization, the specific situation, on how and what is being done. I heard detailed reports at the Staff’s meeting on each combat position, each hottest area. General Syrskyi reported on the Bakhmut direction, Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops. How we are defending our positions, how we are strengthening this particular direction and how much enemy forces we are eliminating. General Sodol reported on the Vuhledar direction, Donetsk operational and tactical group. The situation is very difficult. We are fighting. We are breaking the invader and inflicting extremely tangible losses on Russia. I repeat again and again: the more Russia loses there, in Donbas – Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Maryinka, Kreminna, the sooner we can end this war with Ukraine&#x27;s victory. I heard a report on the situation in the south. In particular, General Hnatov reported on the Odesa direction. The situation is unchanged, we are controlling all potential prospects. General Tarnavsky reported on the specific results of the defense of Tavria operational and strategic group of troops. Thanks to all our warriors who are defending Zaporizhzhia and this entire area! The northern direction, Kyiv, is a must. There was a report by General Nayev. The General reported that the situation is completely under control. As well as along the entire northern border. The Minister of the Interior reported on forming new Offensive Guard brigades. There are great results. It is a very useful experience showing how people can and should be motivated. I will continue this format of work both at the Staff and in informing on defense management. I want our people to know and understand what we prepare and control, and how we do that. Of course, military issues, details of intelligence actions cannot be told in full. But I want our people to have predictability right now. And a feeling that Ukraine is moving towards its goals. Budanov, Malyuk and Lytvynenko delivered reports on that. Today we have a new sanctions step by our state against all those who fuel Russian aggression. I have signed a decree enacting the NSDC decision on sanctions against Russian financial entities. These are Ukraine&#x27;s sanctions. But each of our sanctions packages becomes the basis for working on sanctions with our partners. The next EU sanctions package - the tenth one already - is now being prepared. We are working with our partners to strengthen it. But we are also working with other actors in global relations. Sanctions for terror are something where the efforts of every responsible state can push the global process forward. And it will be so. Today I spoke with President of France Macron. We talked about further defense support, about protecting our people and the whole of Europe. I thank Mr. President for his understanding of our needs and for our shared feeling that we cannot waste a single opportunity and a single week in defending ourselves against Russian aggression. We discussed our joint diplomatic efforts with France, our cooperation on international platforms. We also discussed important decisions that we are preparing for this week - for the year of our invincibility. Today I also held several meetings with government officials and with our international bloc - of the Office and the government. With representatives of the defense sector. There will be new initiatives, new results for Ukraine, new achievements in relations with partners. I thank everyone who defends Ukraine! I am grateful to each and every one who is now in combat! I thank everyone who helps our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the Day of Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-20</span></div>
  <p>My dear people! Ukrainians know what it means to fight for their freedom and defend it. In the squares. On the barricades. On the frontline. In difficult and pivotal moments of history, we never give up and always show bravery and selflessness. Ukrainians stand up for their brothers, and everyone who is Ukrainian is a brother. This is the basis of our unity. The unity that gives our country and people a future despite everything. The unity that gives us indomitability. And this is the basis of our connection with the world, with all those who value freedom and are ready to defend it. The time comes when the voices of millions merge into a single voice of the people, saying that Ukrainians want and will live only in a free state. In their own Ukraine. Which will certainly survive. And which will certainly preserve freedom. Today we honor the heroes who gave their lives for Ukraine and Ukrainians during the Revolution of Dignity. The Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred. People of different ages and professions, from different regions, but with the same and true values. This is respect for every person. Freedom and equality. Democracy. Ukraine&#x27;s openness to the world and the unity of our country with the whole of Europe. And, of course, it is Ukraine&#x27;s independence. What motivated the Maidans to gather and defend themselves. What motivates us to fight and liberate our land now. Dear people! As we defend Ukraine today, we remember that our strength and fortitude are based on the strength and fortitude of many Ukrainians who did not give up, who dreamed and acted for Ukraine to live. Nine years after the Revolution of Dignity, the battle for our independence continues. For an independent, free and powerful Ukraine, European and democratic, independent and united. And there is no doubt that we will protect all this, that we will make the dream of Ukrainian heroes come true. Slaves are not allowed to paradise. This is the essence of the Ukrainian interpretation of freedom. This is the reason why there will be no enemy left on our land. Glory to each and every one who is now fighting for our country! May the memory of all those who gave their lives for Ukraine and Ukrainians live forever! Eternal honor to the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The fate of the world order based on rules, humanity, and predictability is now being decided in Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-20</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a symbolic day. The 362nd day of a full-scale war, and we, in our free capital of our free country, are hosting a visit from our powerful ally, the President of the United States of America, and talking to him about the future of Ukraine, our relations, the whole of Europe and global democracy. This is an indicator of how resilient Ukraine is. And how important Ukraine is to the world. The ninth anniversary of the most horrific days of Maidan, the anniversary of the beginning of Russian aggression against our country, when there was very little time left before the occupation of our Crimea. And now, nine years later, we are more confident than ever that justice will be served. The aggressor state, which has consistently been moving towards becoming a terrorist state, will be held accountable for its crimes. It will be held accountable thanks to the efforts of Ukraine and all our partners, the entire free world, and all those who are now helping us to defend our independence, freedom, and international law and order. We will prevail in this historic confrontation. When President Biden - then Vice President - addressed the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in December 2015, he emphasized a very important point: it is no exaggeration to say that the hopes of all freedom-loving people around the world are with us, with Ukrainians, because so much depends on the success of our fragile experiment with democracy. For our country, for the whole of Europe - free and peaceful. For the whole world, where democracy is under threat. We are now absolutely certain that there is nothing that can undermine our democracy. No element of Ukrainian life is fragile anymore and will never be fragile. And our resilience is a powerful contribution to the resilience of all freedom-loving nations in the world. It is now and in Ukraine that the fate of the world order, which is based on rules, on humanity, on predictability, is being decided. And today, President Biden and I talked, in particular, about how to do everything to ensure our common victory this year in the war that Russia unleashed. Unleashed nine years ago. The full-scale war has been ongoing since last February. We have to do everything to put an end to Russian aggression this year, to liberate our still occupied territories and to guarantee reliable security for our country and for all the peoples of Europe who want to live in freedom and peace. The specific steps for this are known. Our defense needs for this are known. The active actions required for this - the actions of our warriors at the front first of all - are also well known to our partners. All we need is determination. Today I saw such determination of President Biden and the United States of America. And I want to thank Mr. President for this visit and for the talks - really useful talks - that actually continued our conversation that we started in Washington during my visit in December. We are working on the supply of long-range weapons and other types of weapons that were not previously included in the support packages. And I am grateful for another package that will definitely strengthen our guys on the frontline. I am also thankful, on behalf of all Ukrainians, to all Americans - ordinary people and community leaders, members of Congress from both parties, and all members of President Biden&#x27;s team - for bringing our relationship - between Ukraine and America - to a historically most meaningful level. We can be called true allies, and our alliance with America truly strengthens the world. This week we will continue our diplomatic work with representatives of the United States. There will also be significant developments in relations with our other partners both in Europe and around the world. A year of full-scale war, a year of our invincibility, which was a response to the Kremlin&#x27;s illusion of &quot;three days for Kyiv&quot;... A year! And we are organizing a truly Ukrainian global week. Today I held talks with the IMF Managing Director who arrived in Kyiv. I was very pleased to hear a positive assessment of the resilience of our institutions, the efficiency and effectiveness of our country in the face of such brutal and total aggression. There are situations when states fail even in much easier conditions. The Ukrainian state has passed terrible challenges and retained its full functionality. This is another achievement of our people - all those who work for the state. An achievement that is worth commending right now - on these days, on the eve of the anniversary of the invasion. Ukrainians are capable of very significant things, and every day we see new evidence of this. Today I would like to praise our heroes on the frontline traditionally. Those who demonstrate extraordinary courage, incredible resilience and the efficiency Ukraine needs in destroying the enemy every day. Paratroopers of the 79th separate air assault brigade. Infantrymen of the 72nd and the 110th separate mechanized brigades. Units and maintenance forces of these brigades. Gunners of the 55th separate artillery brigade. Thank you, guys, for your bravery and precision in the Donetsk region! Also, the 128th separate mountain assault brigade and the 1st artillery division of the 44th separate artillery brigade. Thank you guys for the worthy response to the enemy&#x27;s attacks against our Zaporizhzhia! The 66th and the 92nd separate mechanized brigades, the 81st separate airmobile brigade, and the 95th separate air assault brigade. Thank you, guys, for not only inflicting significant losses on the enemy in the Luhansk region, but also for giving faith in our movement to liberate our land. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps! May the memory of everyone who gave life for the freedom of Ukraine live forever! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is very important that despite all the pressure on our forces, the frontline has not changed - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-21</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I started this day with an extended and detailed meeting of the Staff. Including reports from the frontline from our commanders in the hottest directions. Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny reported on the overall frontline situation and enemy missile attacks on our positions. Of course, the reports on the Donetsk and Luhansk regions evoke particular emotions. We are doing our best to deter enemy attacks there - constant intense assaults, which Russia does not stop, even though it suffers huge losses there. General Syrskyi reported on the Bakhmut and Lyman directions. Fierce battles are taking place. Principled battles. We are doing everything to support our guys. General Tarnavskyi reported on the fighting in the Avdiivka and other directions. The invaders are using the entire range of weapons against our guys there, including CS gas grenades. But very importantly, despite all the pressure on our forces, the frontline has not changed. I am grateful for this to all our warriors, all soldiers and sergeants, officers and generals who are defending the respective frontline areas. Other commanders of our Defense and Security Forces also reported to the Staff. Nayev, North, and Odesa operational and strategic group of troops, Moskalyov – I heard their reports, the situation has not changed significantly. Intelligence - Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov - on the real essence of Russia&#x27;s trifle with rhetoric about strategic weapons. Foreign intelligence. The Security Service of Ukraine. Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National Guard, the Border Guard Service. The Minister of Defense. Other representatives of the government. We pay full attention to every detail of our Defense Plan and the enemy&#x27;s ambitions. There was also a report by Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal on the situation in the energy sector and the process of restoring our energy system after the Russian strikes. I would like to note that we have good news, good results, and this is the achievement of all our power engineers, repairmen, central and local authorities who have been performing the relevant tasks. We meet the energy needs of people and businesses in most of Ukraine. We continue our diplomatic marathon to strengthen Ukrainian warriors and our entire country. Today I met with the Italian delegation headed by Prime Minister Mrs. Giorgia Meloni. Italy has been supporting us in our struggle for independence in a principled and powerful way. There is a new package of defense support, including air defense. Italy is ready to work with us to implement the Peace Formula. And this includes such an important point as justice. This means a tribunal for the aggressor and a compensation mechanism for Ukraine. Today we also discussed new sanctions against Russia. I am grateful to all Italians for their historic support of Ukraine on its way to the European Union. When we were applying for the candidacy, Italy&#x27;s position gave a very important impetus to the position of the entire European Union. This year, I believe we will be able to make even more progress and do everything we can to start negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership. Today I also met with a delegation of the U.S. Congress. This is a very important signal for our country, the entire region and the world. Yesterday, President Biden was in Kyiv. Today - representatives of the Congress, namely members of the Republican Party. Our cooperation with America does not stop for a single day or a single minute. Together we are effectively strengthening global security. And, by the way, the bewildered complaints coming from Moscow are just another proof of our effectiveness - of Ukraine, the United States, and the entire free world. One more thing. The Russian army has once again brutally shelled Kherson today. There are wounded and dead. My condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones... This Russian shelling did not and could not have any military purpose. As well as thousands of similar Russian attacks, which are a real message from Russia to the world. The terrorist state is trying to tell the world by firing missiles at city streets, at residential buildings, at schools, at pharmacies and hospitals, at churches, at bus stops, at markets, at power plants that terror is allegedly something to be reckoned with... I am confident that we will put the terrorist state in its place. All together: Ukrainians and the world. Our army, our intelligence, our Security Service and other Ukrainian forces will find and destroy those who are carrying out these brutal attacks on Kherson, on our other cities and regions. And more broadly, we will prove that only humanity, only the UN Charter, and only the right of every nation to live freely and securely from terror and insane aggressions like Russia&#x27;s are to be reckoned with. I thank everyone who defends our country! I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine on the frontline right now, who protects our borders, who protects our skies and our sea, who produces and supplies equipment and ammunition for our soldiers, and who provides us with high-quality intelligence information! Glory to our warriors! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russia and this war! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>You have an opportunity to make the historic victory of Ukraine part of your destiny - address by the President to the graduates of higher military educational institutions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-22</span></div>
  <p>Glory to Ukraine! Dear officers, generals! Dear graduates and lecturers of Lviv and Odesa Military Academies! Everyone who dedicated life to the defense of our state and independence! Congratulations on the opportunity to make the historic Ukrainian victory part of your destiny! A victory that our people have been dreaming of for many generations. A victory that the Ukrainian people and our statehood have lacked for so long. It is now and in this war, which Ukrainians did not start, but which we have to end with our joint victory, that Ukraine will gain guaranteed protection. Protection for generations. There will be no enemy on our land. There will be no shackles on our people. There will be no humiliation on Ukrainians. There will not even be a thought somewhere in a foreign land that it is allegedly possible to attack Ukraine and get something for yourself. This is the result you have to achieve in battles. You have to achieve it together with your soldiers, together with your brothers and sisters in arms, together with our entire country. Ukrainians are proud of their army, of our entire Defense Forces, and this is an honest pride. Thousands of Ukrainian warriors have earned it with their bravery, resilience, and precision. I am confident that you can become just such warriors. I would also like to address the parents and educators of our young officers. For the second time in the course of the full-scale war, our military educational institutions are sending worthy new officers to the officer corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations. Choosing this life path is a sign of a person&#x27;s strength, and thus the strength of the family, the strength of the characters of those close to this person. I thank you, dear mothers and fathers of our young officers, dear educators, for the kind of upbringing that allows them to become a strong pillar for the army, the state and the people at such a crucial time. Dear officers! Soon, you will join the active army, our Defense Forces. You will join the teams of combat brigades - mechanized, motorized infantry, tank, artillery, air assault, mountain assault, assault and marine infantry, as well as special forces units. Some of you will lead units in the new offensive brigades that are being formed. Always and everywhere - be brave and take care of your soldiers. Always and everywhere - take care of the honor of your units, believe in yourself and believe in Ukraine! Be worthy of the heroism of all those who have already shown themselves in the battles for Ukraine and Ukrainians! Be worthy of our victory. The victory will happen! Glory to the graduates of the military academies of Ukraine! Glory to our Armed Forces! Glory to all the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will not reduce the pressure on the enemy - both external and internal - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-22</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on this day. I had the honor to address the graduates of our military academies in Lviv and Odesa. The young officers who will soon go to the active army. To the combat brigades fighting for our country and to the new brigades that are being formed. It is a special mission to receive military education right now and to know that tomorrow this education will be needed directly on the battlefield to protect the state and to lead soldiers and units. I am happy that Ukraine&#x27;s higher military educational institutions have no shortage of those who really want to be a Ukrainian officer, who want to be an educated and effective Ukrainian officer, who want to make the story of the Ukrainian victory in this war their own life story. I wished our young officers to be worthy of the heroism that our warriors are already demonstrating on the battlefield and that Ukrainians have always demonstrated in their struggle for freedom. I wished victory to the graduates of our military universities and I am confident that this victory will come. Today, we continued our diplomatic marathon to strengthen Ukraine and protect international law, which gives our country more security. I spoke with four leaders of states. In a conversation with the President of Pakistan, we emphasized the absolute importance of maintaining full force and respect for the UN Charter, the independence of nations and the territorial integrity of states. We discussed our efforts to ensure food security and the existing threats to such security. By the way, our grain export initiative has been operating for seven months already. Over this time, 43 countries have already received more than 22 million tons of food through our sea exports. This is a significant Ukrainian contribution to global food security and stabilization of the global food market. If it was not for this initiative of ours, unfortunately, there would be political and social chaos in some countries in Africa and Asia, and the cost of living crisis that various nations experienced last year would be much more acute. But if this initiative of ours had worked at full capacity, if Russia had not tried to slow it down, we would have been able to export more food products. That is, there would be significantly more guarantees of food security in the world. Our partners know exactly what Russia&#x27;s deliberate actions are undermining food security. Still we are working to provide the necessary stability. We must understand that this is not only a contribution to global security. Our seaborne food exports benefit Ukraine. About a million Ukrainians work in industries related to agricultural production. And for them, the fact that we unblocked maritime exports last year is a guarantee of personal and family social security. Today I spoke with the President of Estonia. I thanked him for the unwavering support for Ukraine at all levels. This includes support with weapons and sanctions against Russia, as well as political support, in particular in European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Today we discussed the upcoming NATO Summit in Vilnius and our expectations in the context of Ukraine&#x27;s integration. We are already preparing for these upcoming events. We also had the first conversation in the history of bilateral relations with the President of Uganda. I informed him about our peace initiatives, which we are promoting at the UN, and about our principled position on the protection of international law. We discussed the potential of bilateral cooperation. In the evening I spoke with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. We are working in a very powerful manner together with the UK to strengthen our warriors, to bring our common victory closer, to implement our defense agreements reached during my visit to London. And it would be great if all our partners, like the UK, understood how the speed of defense supplies affects concrete successes on the battlefield. We also discussed important political issues that need to be resolved this week. The second half of the week will be even more active in terms of international relations. We are maintaining our diplomatic pace. As always, I received reports from our military, defense and security sector leaders throughout the day. In particular, today, Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko reported on the formation of new brigades of the &quot;Offensive Guard&quot;. The results are good. I have held several preparatory meetings in the context of further sanctions steps by our country. We will not reduce pressure on the enemy - both external and internal. I&#x27;ll share the details. Of course, I was in touch with the commanders and our intelligence throughout the day. Today I would like to praise the warriors of the 15th regiment of the National Guard who are defending the Luhansk region and not only defending our positions, but also destroying the enemy in such a way that they are really limiting the offensive capabilities of the invaders in a particular direction. Thank you, guys! In the area of Maryinka in the Donetsk region, the warriors of the 79th separate air assault brigade are particularly effective, holding off enemy attacks every day and night. Almost half of all attacks in this area take place in that area. Our warriors stand strong. Thank you! Over the past day, the 5th separate assault regiment and the 80th separate air assault brigade have achieved results, bravely destroying the enemy south of Bakhmut. Thank you, warriors! I thank everyone who is now defending Ukraine in battles! Thank you to all those who are holding all our northern, eastern and southern directions! Glory to the Ukrainian warriors! Glory to all who strengthen our state! Glory to our beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The Staff considered the production and supply of ammunition and weapons; even in such circumstances, we have the appropriate potential - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-24</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a very eventful day. First - the Staff. Extended format, detailed reports. Zaluzhny, Syrskyi, Tarnavskyi, Moskalyov, Nayev. The situation in the key directions. The east - very difficult. Hurtful. But we are doing everything to endure. The south - in some areas the situation is quite dangerous, but our warriors have means of response to the occupier. Odesa and the Black Sea area - the situation is under control. North - all our warriors in this area can see every intention of the enemy. We are reinforcing where necessary. There was a report by Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov on the current intentions of the occupier. There are decisions on our counteraction. Separately and in great detail, we addressed the issue of production and supply of ammunition and weapons. Of course, I cannot publicly disclose the details of this. But this is meaningful work. And I am glad to hear at the meeting of the Staff that even in such conditions we have the appropriate potential. During the evening I’ve been receiving detailed reports on the situation in Kherson. Another Russian strike damaged the main pipeline that provided heating to about six hundred houses - more than forty thousand people! Repair work will continue without pause until the heating supply is restored. And we will restore it! No matter what these Russian terrorists and bastards do, we will restore everything. Today I held talks with the Prime Minister of Spain, who arrived in Kyiv. I thanked him for the very important Spanish defense and political support. For the fact that during a year of full-scale war, Spain has stood with us in defense against Russian terror. This is a very valuable and value-based cooperation. It is here, on our land, that we are protecting the very values that underpin the life of not only our people, but also the vast majority of European nations. Of course, the life of Spain is based on these values too. That is why we understand each other very well. Spain has become part of our tank coalition. Spain helped us to protect our skies. There are many other parameters of support, both already provided and planned by us. Today I also met with a delegation of the global parliamentary network &quot;United for Ukraine&quot;. These are representatives of 13 parliaments of European countries and the European Parliament. The topic of the meeting is quite clear: weapons for our warriors, sanctions against the terrorist state, and the implementation of our peace initiatives, including the Peace Formula. I spoke with the President of Egypt, including about the defense of international law, our work to restore food security, and some aspects of bilateral relations. It was a good conversation. I devoted a significant part of this day to preparing for tomorrow&#x27;s diplomatic events. We must do everything to make them fruitful for Ukraine. Really significant not only in terms of symbolism, because it will be February 24. But also in terms of real benefits for our defense. Glory to our warriors! Glory to each and everyone who is now in combat! Thank you to everyone who helps us! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy &quot;February. The year of invincibility&quot;</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-24</span></div>
  <p>Great People of Great Ukraine! A year ago, on this day, from this very place, at about seven in the morning, I addressed you with a short statement. It lasted only 67 seconds. It contained the two most important things, then and now. That Russia started a full-scale war against us. And that we are strong. We are ready for anything. We will defeat everyone. Because we are Ukraine! That is how February 24, 2022 began. The longest day of our lives. The hardest day of our modern history. We woke up early and haven&#x27;t fallen asleep since. Some people were afraid, some were shocked, some did not know what to say, but everyone felt what to do. There were traffic jams on the roads, but many people were going to get weapons. Queues were forming. Some people stood at the borders, but many went to military registration and enlistment offices, and territorial defense units. We did not raise the white flag, and began to defend the blue and yellow. We were not afraid, we did not break down, we did not surrender. The symbol of this was the border guards of Zmiinyi Island and the route they told the Russian warship. Our faith has grown stronger. Our morale has been reinforced. We endured the first day of a full-scale war. We didn&#x27;t know what would happen tomorrow, but we realized for sure: every tomorrow is worth fighting for! And we fought. And we fiercely fought for every day. And we endured the second day. And then - the third. Three days that we were predicted to last. They threatened that in 72 hours we would not exist. But we survived the fourth day. And then the fifth. And today we have been standing for exactly one year. And we still know: every tomorrow is worth fighting for! I am grateful to all those who make our resistance possible. These are all our defenders. The Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ground Forces, our infantry and tank-men. Air and Naval Forces. Artillery, air defense, paratroopers, intelligence, border guards. The Special Operations Forces, the Security Service, the National Guard, the police, the territorial defense units - all our security and defense forces. Thanks to you, Ukraine stands. And we endured the furious month and the furious beginning of the war. And then came spring. New attacks, new wounds, new pain. Everyone saw the true nature of our enemy. The shelling of the maternity hospital, the drama theater in Mariupol, Mykolaiv Regional State Administration, Svobody Square in Kharkiv, the train station in Kramatorsk. We saw Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka. The whole world clearly realized what the Russian world really means. What Russia is capable of. At the same time, the world saw what Ukraine is capable of. These are the new heroes. Defenders of Kyiv, defenders of Azovstal. New feats performed by entire cities. Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Hostomel, Volnovakha, Bucha, Irpin, Okhtyrka. Hero Cities. The capitals of invincibility. New symbols. And with that, new assessments and forecasts for Ukraine. The first month of the war. And the first turning point in the war. The first changes in the world&#x27;s perception of Ukraine. It did not fall in three days. It stopped the second army of the world. We took new hits every day, learned about new tragedies every day, but we endured thanks to those who gave it all they got every day. For the sake of others. These are our medics who rescue wounded soldiers on the frontline, perform surgeries under fire, deliver babies in bomb shelters, and stay on duty for days and weeks. Like our rescuers and firefighters who pull people out of the rubble and fire 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And our railroad workers who have been evacuating hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians since the beginning of the war without sleep or rest. And then there were the first offensives, the first achievements, the first liberated territories. The first and not the last Chornobaivka. Expulsion of the occupiers from the Kyiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. Our Stuhna. Vilkha. Our Neptune and the sinking Moskva cruiser. The first Ramstein. And the second ever Lend-Lease. Ukraine has surprised the world. Ukraine has inspired the world. Ukraine has united the world. There are thousands of words to prove it, but a few will suffice. HIMARS, Patriot, Abrams, IRIS-T, Challenger, NASAMS, Leopard. I thank all of our partners, allies and friends who have stood side by side with us throughout the year. I am glad that the international anti-Putin coalition has grown so much that it requires a separate address. I will deliver it shortly. Definitely. I also thank our foreign policy army. Divisions of our diplomats, ambassadors, representatives in international organizations and institutions. All those who are fighting the occupiers with fire and sword of international law, achieving new sanctions and recognition of the terrorist state as a terrorist state. The war changed the fate of many families. It rewrote the history of our families. It changed our customs and traditions. Grandfathers used to tell their grandchildren how they beat the Nazis. Now grandchildren tell their grandfathers how they beat the Rashists. Mothers and grandmothers used to knit scarves, now they weave camouflage nets. Children used to ask Santa for smartphones and gadgets, but now they give pocket money and raise money for our soldiers. In fact, every Ukrainian has lost someone in the past year. A father, a son, a brother, a mother, a daughter, a sister. A loved one. A close friend, colleague, neighbor, acquaintance. My condolences. Almost everyone has at least one contact in their phone who will never pick up the phone again. Will never answer a text message &quot;How are you?&quot;. These simple words have acquired a new meaning during the year of war. Every day, millions of Ukrainians have written or spoken this question to their loved ones millions of times. Every day, someone did not receive an answer. Every day, the occupiers killed our relatives and friends. We will not erase their names from the phone or from our own memory. We will never forget them. We will never forgive that. We will never rest until the Russian murderers face deserved punishment. The punishment of the International Tribunal. The judgment of God. Of our warriors. Or all of them together. The verdict is obvious. 9 years ago, the neighbor became an aggressor. A year ago, the aggressor became an executioner, looter and terrorist. We have no doubt that they will be held accountable. We have no doubt that we will win. In the summer we felt it. We passed 100 days of war. We received EU candidate status, returned Zmiinyi Island, heard the first &quot;Bavovna&quot; in Crimea, saw fireworks at the occupier&#x27;s warehouses and Antonivskyi Bridge. August was the first month when the occupiers did not take a single Ukrainian city. Threats and ultimata about denazification were replaced by gestures of goodwill. And we felt then that our victory was inevitable. It is close. It will come. And then came the autumn. And our counteroffensive. The liberation of Izyum, Balakliya, Kupyansk, Lyman, the Kherson region and the city of Kherson. We saw how people there met our military. How they cherished the Ukrainian flag. How they were waiting and returned to Ukraine. I want to address those who are still waiting. Our citizens who are now under temporary occupation. Ukraine has not abandoned you, has not forgotten about you, has not given up on you. One way or another, we will liberate all our lands. We will do everything for Ukraine to return. And to all those who are now forced to stay abroad, we will do everything for you to return to Ukraine. We will do everything to make it possible. We will fight and bring back every single one of our captive soldiers. Only all this together will be a victory. We can see it even in the dark. Despite the constant massive missile attacks and power outages. We see the light of this victory. In their memories of their first feelings on February 24, 2022, people mention shock, pain, and uncertainty. A year after the full-scale invasion, the faith in victory is 95%. The main emotion we feel when we think about Ukraine is pride. For every Ukrainian man, every Ukrainian woman. Pride for us. We have become one big army. We have become a team where someone finds, someone packs, someone brings, but everyone donates. I am grateful to our people, grateful to our multi-million army of volunteers and citizens who do care, who can collect and get everything necessary. We have become one. Our journalists and media are a united front fighting against lies and panic. We have become one family. There are no more strangers among us. Ukrainians today are all fellows. Ukrainians have sheltered Ukrainians, opened their homes and hearts to those who were forced to flee the war. We withstand all threats, shelling, cluster bombs, cruise missiles, kamikaze drones, blackouts, and cold. We are stronger than that. It was a year of resilience. A year of care. A year of bravery. A year of pain. A year of hope. A year of endurance. A year of unity. The year of invincibility. The furious year of invincibility. Its main result is that we endured. We were not defeated. And we will do everything to gain victory this year! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will make the Ukrainian Peace Formula the basis of a new security in Europe and the world – address of President of Ukraine to participants of International Forum in Kaunas</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-25</span></div>
  <p>Mr. President Gitanas! Dear rector! Ladies and Gentlemen! Lithuanian people! You and us, Ukrainians and Lithuanians, are walking together through the history of Europe. We are united by generations and centuries. We have gone through good times and tragic times, peaceful times and brutal times. Through all the years of our existence, Ukrainians and Lithuanians have always been fighting for freedom, one way or another. Now is a great time. A time when we can win and guarantee our freedom not just for years, not just for decades. Now is the time when we can protect our freedom forever. Russia must lose in Ukraine. Russian revanchism must forever forget about Kyiv and Vilnius, about Chișinău and Warsaw, about our brothers in Latvia and Estonia, in Georgia and in every other country that is now threatened by Russian murderers. We can do it. We have this historic chance. And I thank all of you, Lithuanian people, I thank all of you, friends, for doing everything you can with us to not miss this historic chance. Defense assistance, political, economic, humanitarian - there is no area in which Ukraine has not felt Lithuania&#x27;s sincerity and determination. Ukrainians will always remember this and will always remain grateful for this. And I believe that this year we can add another milestone to our history: our joint victory in the war against a common enemy. We will preserve our independence. We will definitely preserve it. This means that we must act now to give our nations reliable guarantees of non-return of evil. The Ukrainian Peace Formula consists of ten points that provide just such guarantees. These are obviously necessary security points. This is the obviously necessary de-occupation of Ukraine. And this is obviously necessary justice for all those who suffered from Russian aggression. No person on earth should ever again be threatened by hunger and radiation disasters, aggression and terror, energy sector destruction and blackout of international law, deportation and ecocide. Russia is bringing all this with its aggression. We will wipe it all off. Our heroic warriors will do it. Our cooperation with you and with the whole world will do it. Our Peace Formula will do it. And as a result, we will make our Peace Formula the basis for a new security for everyone in Europe and everyone in the world who values life. I am sure that Lithuania will be on this path with us! Glory to all who fight for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>With our courage and weapons, we can restore peace and create a safeguard against any aggressions – Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address to participants of the event of the Federal President of Germany dedicated to solidarity with Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-25</span></div>
  <p>Dear people of Germany! Mr. Federal President! Mr. Chancellor, Olaf! Today is the year since everything has changed. Changed for Ukraine, for Germany, for the whole of Europe and the free world. What the free world has become accustomed to over decades of peace has turned out to be something that needs to be fought for. Diplomacy did not work. The existing security architecture in the world did not work. The old European hope that economic ties could keep Russian tank columns from moving did not work. But there was something that did work. First of all, unity. Unity of Ukraine, Germany, and the entire free world. And determination. Determination to protect the foundations of our lives. We are fighting on Ukrainian soil for what all of you, dear friends, cannot imagine your lives without. This is basic security. This is freedom and life under the law. This is human dignity and the right of every person and every community to be respected. This is happiness of living in a family and an opportunity to dream of a safe and free future for your children. Simple things that 1877 Ukrainian cities and villages are now deprived of. The occupier seeks to increase this number and add millions more broken lives to the already broken ones. You know, in our Mariupol, occupied by Russia, there are almost no undamaged houses left. Russia has done everything to kill this city. Almost half a million people used to live there. 90% of Mariupol is destroyed. Remnants of houses that were destroyed by Russian bombs and missiles, parts of the city that were burned by the occupiers are being demolished by Russia to turn these terrible ruins into concrete crumbs. The crumbs that are going to be used to build roads. We have to do everything possible and impossible to prevent Russia from turning Ukraine, our neighbors, and the whole of Europe, which Russian revanchism wants to reach, into concrete crumbs. Can we win? Yes, we are capable of it. United. Determined. And unbreakable. We are able to end the Russian aggression this year already. Germany has been with us since the first minutes of the Russian invasion. Germany is helping us protect Ukrainians from Russian terror. And Germany will be with us on the day of the victory of freedom, will be with us when we save our cities and villages, now occupied, from Russian captivity. The people of Germany! Mr. Federal President! Mr. Chancellor Olaf! Now is the time when our bravery and our weapons can restore peace and create a historically important deterrent to any aggression. No one will dare to start aggression against another nation when they know that the free world will protect that nation. No one will ever again encroach on freedom when they know that the free world is determined enough to defend freedom. No one will repeat February 24 last year when they know that there is not a single occupier left on the entire territory of Ukraine. We can ensure that - together with you! Together with everyone in the world who values life. I thank you for your support! Thank you for being with us throughout this year! Thank you, President, thank you, Olaf, for your faith in Ukraine, in our people, and in our shared values of a free, united, and peaceful Europe! Glory to everyone who fights for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Sanctions against Russia will continue to be introduced so that nothing remains of the potential of Russian aggression – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-25</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! The tenth package of EU sanctions against Russia for starting the war was approved today. The tenth and obviously not the last package. Sanctions will continue to be introduced so that nothing remains of the potential of Russian aggression. Now, new sanctions steps are in the tenth package, powerful, against the defense industry and the financial sector of the terrorist state and against the propagandists who drowned Russian society in lies and are trying to spread their lies to the whole world. They definitely won&#x27;t succeed. Our diplomats and the entire state are working to extend global and, in particular, European sanctions to the Russian nuclear industry, Rosatom, all those involved in the missile program and nuclear blackmail of the terrorist state. The partners – the United States, the UK – have already made relevant steps. We expect the appropriate steps from the European Union. Of course, we will continue working on Ukraine&#x27;s sanctions against Russian entities and all those who help them. The appropriate decisions will be made. Our resolution, adopted at the UN General Assembly, gave a very good diplomatic impetus this week. The resolution on peace for Ukraine, on the territorial integrity of our state, and protection of international law against Russian aggression. In fact, we see that the essence of our Peace Formula is becoming the basis of specific international political and legal decisions, and the world majority supports them. I thank each of the 141 states that supported our resolution. I thank every leader of the states and every nation who value freedom and international order equally with Ukraine. Of course, every success of our diplomats, every foreign policy opportunity for our state, and every manifestation of world attention to Ukrainians is based on the resilience of the people of Ukraine, the resilience of our soldiers. On the fact that Ukraine is strong and constantly getting stronger. The world loves the strong. And helps the brave. The global center of strength and courage is now right here, in Ukraine, right in our people who defend our state. Who defend our land, our Donetsk region, our Luhansk region, all our lands, where very tough and painful battles continue. I thank each of our soldier, everyone who steadfastly, strongly, and bravely defends our positions in Donbas, destroys the enemy, and I thank you for such a powerful result in the east. The result in the east, so that, consequently, we have the result in all other directions as well. Today, I will honor the fighters of the 56th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade and the 77th Separate Mobile Airborne Brigade for their heroism and effectiveness in the battles near Bakhmut. Well done, guys! Gunners of the 55th Zaporizhzhia Sich brigade, marines of the 35th Separate Brigade named after Rear-Admiral Ostrogradsky, infantrymen of the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade named after Handziuk, and the 72nd Separate Brigade named after Black Zaporozhians, as well as paratroopers of the 79th Air Assault Brigade – all in Donbas – I thank you, guys, for the worthy repulse of the enemy! I especially would like to thank today all servicemen of the Engineering and Aviation Service of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. All those who work on the ground, so that Ukraine wins in the sky. Today is a professional holiday of our military aviation engineers. These are people, whose expertise and reliability fully confirmed our ability to defend the sky. I thank everyone who makes this engineering aviation contribution to the approach of our victory! Glory to everyone who is now in battle! Thank you to everyone who helps defend Ukraine from Russian aggression! Bright memory to all the heroes who gave their lives for us, for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukrainian flags on the streets of Danish cities show love of freedom and courage – President&#x27;s address to the Danish people on the occasion of the anniversary of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-25</span></div>
  <p>Free people of a free country! I can address you, the people of Denmark, in this way. I can address the people of Ukraine in this way. I do so, and that&#x27;s a luxury in today&#x27;s world. A luxury that many people only dream about. Our peoples, Ukrainians and Danes, breathe freely. We have freedom, like most Europeans. And we will not lose our freedom, because we not only dream about it, we fight for it. We have not missed the moment that was pivotal. Last year, when the Russian evil started an all-out war against us, we were not afraid. We did not lose our grip. Ukrainians stood up to defend the state. The free world stood up to defend Ukraine. And I thank you, the people of Denmark, for not wavering in your commitment to our defense. I thank you for realizing that freedom cannot be just a dream, it must be actions. Actions in defense of life and people, rules and respect, justice and security. Thank you, people of Denmark, for your actions! For the weapons that help our defense. For the policy that helps isolate the aggressor. For your willingness to join our reconstruction after hostilities. And, of course, for your belief that the project of a united and free Europe cannot be complete without Ukraine&#x27;s full integration. I know that there were many Ukrainian flags on the streets of many cities in Denmark during this year of our unity. I am grateful to you for every such flag of Ukraine in your cities, in your squares. The blue and yellow colors of Ukraine have always been a freedom-loving sign. They always indicate the presence of freedom. And therefore, they indicate the presence of bravery. Your bravery, people of Denmark, is a fact already. Your bravery, Mrs. Prime Minister, is a fact already. Your bravery, dear members of the Danish Folketing, is also a fact already. Just as our Ukrainian bravery is a fact. Hence, our freedom will never cease to be a real fact of our lives. Thank you for your support! Thank you for every day that we have gone through and will go through together! I am sure we will be with you on our major day - the day of our victory. Mange tak, Danske folk! Glory to all who fight for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The pressure of Ukraine and the world on the terrorist state will be continued - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-26</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, we are ending this week with a strong diplomatic event - for the first time in 32 years, a high-level delegation from Saudi Arabia visited Ukraine. This is yet another sign of respect for Ukraine, for our invincibility and strength. Respect of the world. Monday – the leader of the United States of America, President Joe Biden, was in Kyiv. Director of the International Monetary Fund was in Kyiv. Tuesday – Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was in Kyiv. And a powerful delegation from the U.S. Congress - representatives of the Republican Party - was also in Kyiv. Wednesday - a conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The first conversation in the history of bilateral relations with the President of Uganda. A conversation with the President of Pakistan. A conversation with the President of Estonia. Thursday - Spanish Prime Minister Sánchez was in Kyiv. A conversation with the President of Egypt. A visit of representatives of the global parliamentary network &quot;United for Ukraine&quot;. These are 13 European states’ parliaments and the European Parliament. Finally, a historically significant vote of the UN General Assembly in favor of our resolution on peace and territorial integrity of our country. 141 countries endorsed it! Friday, the anniversary of invincibility - Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki was in Kyiv, and Leopards, modern battle tanks, arrived in Ukraine. The result we have been working on for many, many months. The meeting of the G7 leaders and Ukraine&#x27;s participation in this meeting. Over the past year, Ukraine has become a traditional participant in top international formats. Now I had another good meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It was the first official visit of such level by a representative of this country. Of course, we are working on a higher level of visits and relations. But now we have finally reached an interaction. And this, by the way, brings concrete and sensitive results for Ukrainians, in particular with regard to the release of prisoners of war. I thank our Saudi partners for their cooperation and assistance. This is one week. And again and again, it&#x27;s about strengthening our state, our soldiers, our steadfastness, our international positions. Today, I met with representatives of our Ukrainian television, the Ukrainian telethon &quot;United News&quot;. Journalists, editors, producers. It was a meaningful online meeting. The reason for the meeting is the anniversary of the telethon and gratitude to everyone who works in it. But the content was much broader. We talked about intensifying the information work of our state and society. This especially concerns those parts of the world where our diplomacy has not been represented for many decades for various reasons. And now we have to make sure that we are as powerful as possible in terms of information and diplomacy. We need to make Ukraine&#x27;s position absolutely clear in all parts of the world. This is important in our work to ensure the de-occupation of the territory and our planned active actions. The more people know about Ukraine, the more they understand Ukraine, the more they support Ukraine, the closer our victory becomes. I once again thank everyone who works in the telethon, who creates this information foundation of our national unity. Thank you for your dedication to the Ukrainian cause, for your sincere desire to find and develop formats that will strengthen the telethon and, therefore, Ukraine. And I thank you for your constant search for new methods of work for those who are now in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, for finding new ways to access our people in Donetsk, Luhansk, the south of the country, and Crimea. It is very important that Russia has not succeeded in closing off our people and our land informationally in the part of Ukraine where the terrorists&#x27; tricolor is still present. We have to do everything we can - and we will do everything to ensure that our people have more access to truthful information. Today, on February 26, we mark the Day of Resistance to the Occupation of Crimea and Sevastopol. And today this conversation is especially important. It is about ensuring an understanding through information and all other means that Ukraine will not abandon anyone, will not leave anyone to the enemy. We will return all our people and everything ours from Russian captivity. In 2014, Russian aggression began with the seizure of Crimea. It is logical that by liberating Crimea, we will put a historic end to any attempts by Russia to ruin the lives of Ukrainians and all the peoples of Europe and Asia that the Kremlin once claimed to conquer. International law will prevail here, on the lands of Ukraine: in Donbas, Pryazovia, Kherson region and Crimea. I thank everyone who brings this victory closer! I thank everyone who helps our people in the temporarily occupied territory! Glory to each and every one who is now in combat! By the way, today I am especially grateful to our guys from the 110th separate mechanized brigade who shot down another enemy aircraft near Avdiivka! Glory to all our heroes of resistance in the temporarily occupied territory! All of Ukraine will be free! And one more thing. Today we have new decisions of our state on sanctions against those who are involved or help Russia wage war and destroy lives and people. I signed three decrees to implement the NSDC decisions. Against those Russians who are involved in the abduction of Ukrainian children. Against those representatives of the Russian sports sector who are trying to put sports in the service of aggression. And against those who help maintain mercenary structures in Russia for the war against Ukraine and all free people. Ukraine&#x27;s pressure will continue. The world&#x27;s pressure on the terrorist state will continue. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We need modern combat aircraft to protect the entire territory of Ukraine from Russian terror - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy </h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-27</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report on this day. The day began with an attack by Iranian drones. Most of them were shot down. Eleven out of fourteen. Unfortunately, there were also hits. Three employees of the State Emergency Service in Khmelnytskyi were wounded, two were killed. My condolences to the families. The second drone hit just as the fire was being extinguished after the first hit. In fact, that is why we need the aviation component of air defense - modern combat aircraft - to protect the entire territory of our country from Russian terror. Air defense is complete only when it is backed by aviation. Modern aviation. Our pilots, together with our anti-aircraft gunners, together with all the warriors and specialists of our Air Forces, are already doing a great job. But we will be able to fully protect the sky when the aviation taboo in relations with our partners is lifted. The elimination of consequences of the power grid accident in Odesa and the Odesa region lasted all day. There was a large-scale power outage, but the power supply was restored within a day. As of this evening, all critical infrastructure and the vast majority of consumers have electricity. I am grateful to all power engineers and repair crews who ensured a quick result. Ukraine demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate that our resilience is higher than anyone&#x27;s expectations. Today, I held several meetings with representatives of the government and security agencies. In particular, a meeting with Head of the Security Service of Ukraine Vasyl Malyuk. We discussed current issues and our steps to protect the state in the near future. We will not leave any chance to any internal threats, just as we don’t leave it to external ones. Of course, I am constantly in touch with our commanders. Special attention to the situation in the east, of course, in the Donetsk region. Bakhmut direction - the situation is getting more and more difficult. The enemy is constantly destroying everything that can be used to protect our positions, to gain a foothold and ensure defense. Our warriors defending the Bakhmut sector are real heroes. I am grateful to each and every person who is heroically holding this direction and other directions in Donbas. I thank each and every one who helps our warriors and does everything to ensure that our defenders have as many weapons, long-range weapons, powerful weapons as possible. Today, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury paid a visit to Kyiv. I thanked her for the vital financial support for our country. We discussed our current cooperation both at the level between Ukraine and the United States and at the level of global financial institutions, including the IMF. We discussed the needs for reconstruction in Ukraine and the restoration of justice for our people and the entire free world, which means launching a real mechanism of compensation for the damage caused by this war... compensation at the cost of Russian assets. This is not an easy task. But fulfilling it and directing Russian assets to compensate for the war damage will be one of the most powerful hits of the free world against this aggressor and against any aggression in general. I think a format for compensation will be found and Russia will pay for its war. In every sense. Glory to each and every one who is now fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps! May the memory of all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror be eternal! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I urge you to come to Ukraine now, so that by the time of victory, your hard work has already yielded results - speech by the President at the spring session of the Board of Directors of the National Association of Manufacturers</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-28</span></div>
  <p>Thank you so much! Thank you, Mr. President, thanks everybody! Thank you for your kind words and support! Ladies and Gentlemen! I greet you from free Ukraine, and thank you for your attention and support of our struggle for freedom and independence. And I am sure that none of you doubt that we will win this fight. Ukraine is indeed the place where democracy will defeat tyranny. The united democracy – Ukrainian, American, all our allies and partners. But what will our joint victory mean? This is not a purely ideological battle. Yes, we will prove that democracy is stronger than tyranny. When Russia loses, we will prove that terrorist states cannot overcome the power of a united democratic world. And when we restore our territorial integrity, we will also restore the full power of international law, which is equally important for everyone in the world. However, the battle is for much more, and there will be more winners in it. The human nature is yet another battlefield, where the confrontation continues. Right now. In what will the creativity of the human mind be more successful? In serving good or evil? What will give more prospects – hard work or complicity in making money from the aggression? This confrontation is going on right now. And that is why right now we are calling on all businesses to come to Ukraine and to leave the Russian market. It is obvious, that post-hostilities reconstruction of Ukraine will give an extraordinary moral advantage to all businesses that will be in. And it is also obvious that every business that is now helping the Russian tyranny, in any way, will not be able to avoid problems and a reputation crisis. The American business has every opportunity to take leadership positions both in the reconstruction of the Ukrainian economy and infrastructure, and in demonstrating to the world that human nature should serve worthy goals and that it produces – and will always produce! – the best result. The Ukrainian life will inevitably get a new start after this war. We need to rebuild the energy system of Ukraine based on new security principles. It is in Ukraine that we will combine green transformation with security transformation and create an example for the same transformation in other countries. Such as to protect a specific country from any aggression against the energy industry. And such that protects all humanity under the framework of a smart climate policy. For example, on the Virtual Power Plants market, 7 out of 15 key companies are American. This is the experience that Ukraine needs. And Ukraine is an opportunity that will give a historic impulse to the entire industry. Plus solar power plants, wind power plants, small hydroelectric power plants, biomass burning plants... Our modernized and decentralized energy system is a project worth hundreds of billions of dollars and with the potential of replication for other nations. We need to restore hundreds of thousands of industry, infrastructure and social facilities, residential buildings. Whole cities, industries, productions. This is a colossal task, but realistic. Ukraine is interested in projects to create a full production cycle of titanium, lithium, aluminum and ferrous metallurgy. Ukrainian oil refineries, which were destroyed by Russian missile strikes, and a capacious domestic market provide the opportunity to restore this industry on a modern technological basis. Machine building in Ukraine, agricultural processing in Ukraine, weapons production in Ukraine, including modern drones, IT in Ukraine, infrastructure and transport in Ukraine, localization of business in Ukraine and convenient logistics with other markets from Ukraine, human capital of Ukraine – all these are not just investment opportunities, not just industries and not just growth. This is a wide space for victories. Your victories, American business! And I urge you to prepare for these victories now, to come to Ukraine now. So that by the time we restore peace, your hard work has already yielded results. I believe that it will be so! Thank you for your attention! I invite all of you to Ukraine! Glory to our brave soldiers! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are preparing the return of our warriors to actions for the liberation of our land - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-02-28</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is the day when, in various formats, we worked for justice for Ukraine and Ukrainians in one way or another. Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan is on a visit to Ukraine. These are an institution and a person who undoubtedly play a historic role in bringing Russian criminals to justice. Russia&#x27;s genocidal policy against our people will definitely have inevitable legal consequences for all those who conceived, approved and implement such a policy. And I want to emphasize: this isn’t only about the executors, but also about the top political and military leadership of the terrorist state. Today we discussed this with Karim Khan during a meeting in Kyiv. Of course, this is not an easy job. But responding to Russian crimes in the face of this aggression exactly in terms of the rule of law and exactly with the power of an international court is what will serve as one of the guarantees of the long-term future security of both Ukrainians and other nations. We will ensure this. We are approaching the opening of the Ukrainian office of the International Criminal Court. There is already effective cooperation in Ukraine between the International Criminal Court and the Office of the Prosecutor General. We pay special attention to such Russian crimes as the deportation of our people and the deportation of Ukrainian children. We will dismantle this entire Russian genocidal system, from the cogs to the architects, and bring them to legal verdicts. Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. Again in an expanded format. The Main Intelligence Directorate, the Ministry of Defense, the Commander-in-Chief, and the commanders of directions delivered reports. We are dealing in detail with the situation on each of the frontline directions. The most difficult situation is still Bakhmut and the battles that are important for the defense of the city. I&#x27;ll give you just one example. Nowadays, the meetings of the Staff are held quite often - at least twice a week. The last meeting was on Thursday. And today, General Syrskyi reported that since the last meeting, about 800 enemies have been killed in his direction alone. Russia does not count people at all, sending them to constantly storm our positions. The intensity of fighting is only increasing. I thank all Ukrainian warriors who, despite this insane pressure from the occupier, are defending our positions and destroying the Russian army! I thank each and every one who supports our warriors! Of course, we also considered other areas in Donbas, as well as the areas of responsibility of the Tavria and Odesa groups. General Moskalyov reported on the situation around Kherson and the region. This day there were more than 30 Russian shelling occasions in the Kherson region! They were shelling just streets, just people. My condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones. Today we have already lost four people. We will do everything to suppress the terrorists. General Nayev reported on the situation in the north and along the border - our forces are in control of the situation. As always, we reviewed in detail the logistics for the frontline and the coverage of deficits. We are preparing for the return of our warriors to actions for the liberation of our land. We keep in mind this just goal of ours, and every day we are getting closer to its fulfillment. Ukraine will be free. All of Ukraine. Today I met with the Secretary-General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This is one of the most powerful global organizations that brings together the world&#x27;s leading countries. Those countries where people really want to live. Our goal is for Ukraine to fully join the organization and to use the OECD experience to modernize our country. Tomorrow we are opening the OECD Office in Kyiv. Today we talked, in particular, about a fair tax system for Ukrainians - transparent, simple, and one that will strike a balance between stimulating business and economic growth and ensuring social justice. I also offered the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to join the work on directing Russia&#x27;s assets to compensate for the damage caused by Russian aggression. If someone thinks that this is an unrealistic task, today, on February 28, we have very concrete evidence that there are no unrealistic tasks for Ukraine. A year ago, on the fifth day of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine applied to join the European Union. This was the first step in obtaining the candidacy. We have done a tremendous and tremendously fast job and have secured candidate status for Ukraine. This year, we should reach a decision on membership negotiations for Ukraine. Another example. Today, there was no shortage in our energy system. There were no power outages across the country. Thousands of people have been working every day to achieve this result. They restored what could be restored after the Russian strikes. They protected the energy system. They helped cities, communities, and people. Of course, the threat still remains. Of course, we will fight and defend ourselves. We will definitely endure, no matter what the enemy does. I thank each and every one who contributed to this task! One more thing. Today is the Day of Air Navigation Service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is the day of those specialists of our defense forces on whom the effectiveness of Ukrainian combat aviation directly depends. Thousands of successful sorties and successful air strikes on enemy positions are their merit, the merit of our navigators. I congratulate you, warriors, on your holiday, and wish you complete dominance of the Ukrainian Air Force in the Ukrainian sky! Absolutely fair dominance. Glory to each and every one who is now fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>This winter was very difficult, but we managed to provide Ukraine with energy and heat - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-01</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I held several fundamentally important meetings. The meeting on the energy sector was attended by everyone who is responsible for the stability of our energy system. It was a long meeting - three hours. Energy companies: Naftogaz, Energoatom, Ukrenergo, Ukrhydroenergo, and others. The Government. The Office. The head of the relevant committee of the Verkhovna Rada. Military. Intelligence. This winter is over. It was very difficult, and every Ukrainian without exaggeration felt this difficulty. But we still managed to provide Ukraine with energy and heat. Yes, the threat to the energy system remains. But the work for the sake of the energy system is also continued. At the energy meeting, we have set the current tasks to ensure that this heating season is completed properly. And we have already started preparing for the next season - each of the meeting participants has received their part of the work in this regard. We see risks, we will find a response. Today, I also held a long, detailed conference call with all those who are in charge of various areas of state defense. The military, the Security Service, the Main Intelligence Directorate, foreign intelligence, the MIA, other government officials, the Office. We keep each frontline direction under control. Khortytsia, Tavria, Odesa, North - there were reports on the situation over the past day. In addition to the frontline directions, we are also paying attention to the frontline areas. Those cities and districts that are subjected to Russian shelling every day and night. To a deliberate terror. Nikopol and other communities of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and the region, the frontline part of Donbas, Kharkiv and the region, Sumy and Chernihiv regions. Now, in most of the territory of our country, where we have managed to provide relative security, you may not feel what life is like for those of our people who live in the border areas with Russia, who live in the south of our country. Where there are shelling occasions. Where people are not at the front, but still directly at war. Where Russia is constantly trying to destroy everything that people have. Constantly - and this is no exaggeration. When we are preparing the actions of our military, all our defense and security forces, we also mean that such actions will gradually return security to those who are now in the frontline zone. Every movement of our flag forward will mean the safety of our people. In the territories that will be liberated from the occupier. In those territories that will become a deeper rear. And in those border areas where the defeat of the invader will finally bring peace. I am grateful to everyone who is ready to help our country in further active actions! I thank each and every one of our defense and security forces who is already preparing! And I thank those who, despite all the threats, despite all the dangers, are doing everything possible to ensure that normal life is maintained in the frontline areas of Ukraine, in cities and communities that are subjected to Russian attacks! These are the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, police forces, our social and administrative services, local authorities, conscientious businesses, and of course, volunteers who help people and the state. Special thanks to our border guards and all other warriors who are holding back the enemy! And particular gratitude to our warriors who are destroying the occupiers&#x27; firing points, destroying the enemy&#x27;s logistics and accurately leading Russia to defeat. To inevitable defeat. Glory to all those who are now fighting for Ukraine! Eternal memory and honor to each and every one who gave their lives for the independence of our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The occupier will inevitably feel our strength of justice - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-02</span></div>
  <p>I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! A brief report on the day. I have just spoken with the President of Brazil. It was a useful conversation. We are resuming contacts between our countries at the highest level. I informed him about Russia&#x27;s attacks against our people, about the killing of children, about the strikes on our civilian infrastructure. I thanked Brazil for supporting our resolution on peace and territorial integrity for Ukraine. We discussed diplomatic efforts to stop Russian aggression and restore peace for our country, the region, and the world. In particular, international efforts to implement our Peace Formula. Today I also spoke with the President of Switzerland. This is our first conversation with the new President. I thanked him for the support package for Ukraine and our people. We discussed further bilateral cooperation and possible interaction on international platforms. I heard that Switzerland is interested in implementing our Peace Formula. This is a very good signal. I held a meeting of the Staff, which focused solely on the frontline and security situation. The Commander-in-Chief made a general report. There was an intelligence report. Detailed reports from specific combat areas, from the commanders of our groups of troops. Khortytsia Operational and Strategic Group of Troops - key attention to Bakhmut. Tavria Operational and Strategic Group of Troops - discussed the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia directions. General Tarnavskyi delivered a detailed report. Today&#x27;s brutal Russian missile attack on Zaporizhzhia will face our military and legal response. The occupier will inevitably feel our strength. The strength of justice in every sense of the word. And I want to thank all our rescuers who have been clearing the rubble of the house whose block was destroyed by the missile since the night before. They managed to rescue 11 people, and more than 70 received help. Two people are currently on the list of those killed. My condolences to the families! Odesa Operational and Strategic Group of Troops - a report about the situation in the southern direction. In particular, the situation in Kherson and the region. Of course, we do not ignore the north of our country, the border. Commanders are well aware that their task is to do everything possible to suppress terrorist fire. And we are constantly working with our partners to increase the range of our capabilities. Today, I signed several decrees awarding our warriors. In total, 847 defenders received state awards on this day. Soldiers of our mechanized brigades, tankmen, artillerymen, marines, intelligence officers, Air Force, Special Operations Forces, territorial defense, the National Guard, the National Police, border guards, SBI and SES employees. As of today, the number of our defenders whose bravery and efficiency have been recognized with state awards is over 40 thousand. I thank everyone who defends our country! I am grateful to all those who daily accustom Russia to the idea that Ukraine cannot be broken. We will endure. We will win. And we will bring all Russian terrorists to justice. Glory to our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The world needs a real embodiment of the rule of law to protect humanity from the source of all aggressions – the address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the United for Justice conference in Lviv</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-03</span></div>
  <p>Every shot that takes an innocent life must result in a legal and fair sentence that punishes murder. Every violence that destroys a person&#x27;s life must result in a legal and fair judicial decision that protects human dignity. These are constants for civilized and democratic countries. For the countries in which the rule of law is consistently ensured. But it is time to make it constant for international relations as well. The constants that will act universally and most importantly – irrevocably in relation to any violator of international law. Especially when it comes to the crime of aggression. The world needs a real embodiment of the rule of law, which is guaranteed to protect humanity from the &quot;right of force&quot; – from the source of all aggressions. Dear attendees! Dear Mr. President, and First Lady! Our dear guests! Numerous words of conventions and other international treaties for the protection of people and humanity should become concrete legal decisions and actions. The noble intention of the creators of international law should be reflected in the energy of international justice. In response to all the crimes and injustices caused by Russian aggression against the state of Ukraine and against the civilized system of the world, all the necessary steps must be taken by us and you. Steps for the sake of one result. The result that will unite the civilized world. It will testify to the reality of the rule of international law. Namely: The President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, and all his accomplices must receive legal and fair sentences. For everything they did. In the name and memory of all whose lives they took, and whose destinies they destroyed. For the aggression they unleashed. The world must strongly respond to Russian aggression and terror with all the strength of the common heritage of our nations. Law is one of the core elements of the firmness of human culture. Any revenge cannot do what justice can do. The law is able to ensure not only the prosecution of the perpetrators of specific crimes. Including the perpetrators of the most serious crime, the crime that gives rise to all other crimes of war and genocide, the crime of aggression. The law can eliminate even the hypothetical possibility of feeling impunity for those who are capable of starting terrorist wars. The real rule of law at the global level, and therefore effective international justice, would protect the world from such wars and their terrible consequences. What did this year, which you and I just saw on the screens – the year of the terrorist war – bring to Ukraine? Only one year... Over 70,000 Russian war crimes have already been recorded. But, unfortunately, we do not know about all crimes at the moment. A large part of our territory still remains occupied, and we cannot currently reliably predict how many Russian crimes we would discover after the occupiers are expelled. However, it is clear how serious these crimes are. What the scale of the criminal manifestations of Russia&#x27;s aggression is. We remember everything. We remember Bucha – and what the Russian soldiers did there. We remember the village of Yahidne in Chernihiv region, in fact, the concentration camp into which the occupiers turned the basement of the village school. For weeks, more than three hundred people – from the elderly to children – were kept there. In the confined space, in the dark, in the suffocation. We remember the numerous abuses and rapes of adults and children, which forever changed the world&#x27;s view of what Russia is and what it is. We remember that, fleeing from Ukrainian land, the occupiers leave behind torture chambers and graves. We remember thousands of terrorist attacks by missiles, thousands of terrorist attacks by drones – attacks against our people. We remember dozens of cities and villages in Ukraine burned by Russia. Therefore, we can predict what else we would face when we return to the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Mariupol and Volnovakha, Olenivka, and dozens of other places where Russia brought death and suffering have yet to reveal the full truth to the world about the atrocities of the occupiers in Ukraine. And you and I have to prepare a complete toolkit – both at the national and international levels – so that justice will work in relation to all aspects of Russian aggression. And in relation to all the perpetrators of this aggression. We now have data on thousands of civilian victims of the Russian attack. Thousands... But it is obvious that the occupier took the lives of a much larger number of our people. Absolutely all of us understand that. We all seek to punish the terrorist state. It is the moral and legal duty of the world to the victims of Russian terror. And It is the security duty of the civilized and democratic world to any nation that may be threatened by the same aggression as Russia. Dear attendees! I ask you now to observe a moment of silence in memory of all Ukrainian men and women who were killed by Russian aggression, the memory of each of our soldiers who gave their lives to stop evil. * Today, the President of Latvia and the very experienced lawyer, Mr. Egils Levits is here in Lviv. The First Lady is here. The Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Netherlands, a country that is one of the world leaders in the protection of justice and international law, is here. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, who vigorously and professionally defends Europe and the international order. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Mr. Karim Khan, is here, the European Commissioner for Justice, the President of Eurojust. Attorneys general and ministers of justice, special representatives of partner states – Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States. The legal community of Ukraine and many countries of the world is represented here. Thanks to this Lviv conference, thanks to you, we can develop a new format of international cooperation for the sake of justice. It was in Lviv that at one time great figures studied and worked, Raphael Lemkin studied and worked – the author of the concept of genocide as a crime, thanks to which international norms for the prevention of genocide and punishment for it were determined. The name of Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the most famous architects of the modern system of international law, is associated with Lviv. Louis Sohn studied and worked in Lviv – another outstanding personality whose work we see today in the existence of UN institutions and international justice. Today&#x27;s meeting here in Lviv has a solid historical foundation, a solid scientific and legal basis. We have to do it – and we will do it! – another Lviv&#x27;s contribution to international law. Another Ukrainian contribution to international justice. Right here and right now, we are bringing the process to a completely new level, a complex process, in the final of which there will be verdicts. Sentences to those who are guilty of Russian aggression. The first thing we must achieve: our union for justice must become a powerful impetus for the adoption of the draft Ukrainian resolution by the UN General Assembly – the resolution that would contribute to the creation of a Special Tribunal on the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. The tribunal will become the link that will solve the problem of the impossibility of the International Criminal Court to prosecute precisely for the crime of aggression. An office is opening in Ukraine, the Prosecutor General said about it. I consider this a great event for justice – the office of the International Criminal Court is opening. And we will further strengthen our relationship with the ICC, which will help bring to justice citizens of the terrorist state guilty of crimes under the jurisdiction of the ICC. We should pay special attention to the crimes committed and being committed by Russia against our Ukrainian children. It is about the deportation of children, the abduction, and attempts to erase the national and family identity of our children. The national judiciary and all its institutions must also work at full capacity. We understand that the majority of Russian crimes on Ukrainian land and against Ukrainian citizens would receive a fair response precisely within the framework of our national jurisdiction. And I thank everyone who is already helping to implement each of these three large-scale tasks. Now, in Lviv, we have to define the correct priorities in this work. Doctrinally and terminologically, politically and practically – we have to give answers to the question of how to go flawlessly through the entire process of bringing the Russian occupiers to justice – from gathering evidence and identifying each culprit to making guilty verdicts, from making the necessary decisions to actually securing justice for Ukraine, for our people, for all victims of Russian aggression and for the whole world. Let everything that we still lack be heard and supported today here in Lviv, so that one day we can say absolutely abundantly: the murderers have been punished, the dignity and honor of the people have been protected, the damage has been compensated, and justice has won. I wish all of us, all of you, fruitful work! Thank you for your attention! And please remember – what exactly allows us to be united now, united for the most important thing – justice. Every person matters. That is, every person is important, every life is important to us. Glory to all these great people – to all those who protect Ukraine and the international order on the legal front! I also want to thank you for that. Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are gathering as much as possible support for Tribunal over Russia&#x27;s aggression against Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-03</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today in the morning – in Lviv, was a very busy day. Meetings, negotiations, the United for Justice Conference dedicated to the restoration of justice for Ukraine. Now Lviv, all of Ukraine have attracted the legal vigor of all of Europe and our other partners. Representatives of the countries of the European Union and European institutions came to the Conference. In particular, the European Commissioner for Justice, the head of Eurojust. And also representatives of the UK and the United States. Attorneys general and justice ministers of various countries are in Lviv today. The President of Latvia, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Netherlands, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia – active lobbyists for justice – are our special guests, and I held separate negotiations with them today. The main issue of all these meetings and the Lviv conference is accountability. The accountability of Russia and its leadership is personal! For aggression and terror against our state and people. And when there is their accountability, justice will be restored. We are gathering as much as possible support for the Tribunal over Russia&#x27;s aggression against Ukraine. For the draft of our resolution on the protection of international law, which will be put to a vote in the UN General Assembly. We are doing everything to ensure that the International Criminal Court is successful in punishing Russian war criminals. And that our national law enforcement and judicial institutions ensure fair sentences for all Russian murderers and executioners. A separate meeting with the attorneys general of partner states and international institutions was very fruitful. We see the protection of the rule of law in the same way. Negotiations with the foreign ministers of the Netherlands and Estonia were also fruitful. The negotiations with the President of Latvia, who today, by the way, visited Ukraine for the third time during the full-scale war, went very well. We also signed an important bilateral declaration with our Latvian counterpart. The declaration that enshrines justice at the political level. Latvia fundamentally supports the full integration of Ukraine into the European Union and NATO and will defend this position at all levels. So, today is a really fruitful day. And what is very important – this day began with honoring the heroism of our soldiers. In the morning, I visited the Lviv hospital, where our soldiers are being rehabilitated after wounds. I had the honor to communicate with the soldiers and present them with state awards. I also presented awards to doctors who save the lives of our soldiers. Together with the President of Latvia and the first ladies of our states, we honored the memory of fallen heroes at the Field of Honor at Lychakiv Cemetery. And I thank all partners of Ukraine. I thank every leader, every politician, every public figure of the helping states – for understanding the price that the Ukrainian people pay for their freedom and that of all Europeans. Every day, Ukrainian heroes give their lives to stop Russian aggression. And that is why the world has a clear moral obligation to our soldiers, to each and every one who is currently in battle and who defends freedom. This duty is to restore justice and bring the terrorist state and its leadership to justice. And it will be. Today, we have someone to celebrate for success on the battlefield. I thank the soldiers of the 27th Pechersk Brigade of the National Guard, who are fighting near Donetsk. They are skillfully destroying enemy equipment. I&#x27;m thankful to the anti-aircraft guns of the Air Force – they shot down another Russian bomber. The Nikopol anti-aircraft missile regiment. Keep it up, warriors! I thank the soldiers of the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, 79th Separate Air Assault Brigade, marines from 35th Brigade, gunners from 55th Artillery Brigade... The decent repulse of the enemy now is a prerequisite for the success of our defense operations in the coming months. I thank the soldiers of the 128th Separate Territorial Defense Brigade and the First Tank Brigade, who are defending Zaporizhzhia region. Well done, guys! And of course, I thank each and every one of the Khortytsia task force, who defend Bakhmut, who persistently and bravely performs combat tasks. Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who brings the victory of our people and the historic sentences to the organizers and perpetrators of Russian aggression closer! Eternal memory and respect to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine and the salvation of our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The Cabinet of Ministers in March will prepare the decisions our communities need for budget sustainability – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-04</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! The meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Ukraine has just ended in Lviv. It was a very representative gathering today. There were heads of central and local authorities, representatives of government authorities and local communities. From all over our country – all regions, all parts. The main issues are security, energy, social protection, financial issues. Anti-corruption. All that is needed for greater strength of our institutions and for greater security of our people – in every sense of the word &quot;security.&quot; It was agreed today that already in March the Cabinet of Ministers will prepare the decisions our communities need for budget sustainability. Relevant changes to the law on the state budget of Ukraine will be proposed to the Verkhovna Rada. Today, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the State Anti-Corruption Program at its meeting, which was actually combined with the Congress meeting. These are systemic steps that will give the state more transparency, and society – more opportunities to interact with the state. The United for Justice conference, which started yesterday, continues here in Lviv. Several panel discussions took place today, including the investigation, punishment of the occupiers for abuse of people, rape, and other violent crimes committed in the occupied territory. The world is already helping us with these investigations. But, of course, much, much more needs to be done. Not only to identify all criminals, not only to punish them but also to help people who have been abused to overcome this blow and return to a normal life. The First Lady of Ukraine, President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola, the First Lady of Latvia, the special representative of the UN Secretary-General, and our government officials took part in the relevant part of the conference. A very meaningful discussion. Together with Ms. Metsola, today we met with Ukrainian students from six Lviv universities. I also held talks with the President of the European Parliament. It is obvious that this year our cooperation with European institutions will be even more meaningful than last year. The task is to actively prepare everything for our country&#x27;s EU membership, increase the supply of weapons to Ukraine, and strengthen sanctions against Russia. And I thank Mrs. Roberta Metsola, and all our friends in Europe, who help Ukraine on the integration path. Thank you to everyone who helps enhance the security of Ukraine and strengthen our soldiers! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine, who defends our border and who establishes justice for Ukraine with their accuracy on the battlefield, who responds to the occupier&#x27;s terror with active fire. Today morning, I was in touch with the commanders: the front is the first priority. I will especially note the fighters who defend Bakhmut. In particular, soldiers of the 56th separate motorized infantry brigade, the 67th and 93rd separate mechanized brigades, and the 77th separate airborne brigade. Thank you, guys!

  <h2>The world is strong enough to punish Russia for the war, and we will provide courage and tools to make it happen - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-05</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today marks the end of the first week of the new spring, and it is important to make a few meaningful points about what we have managed to accomplish this week. Accomplish for Ukraine. A large-scale conference was held with the participation of many of our partners - lawyers from Ukraine, Europe and the world. United for Justice. Step by step, we are moving towards ensuring that the terrorist state is held fully accountable for what it has done to our country and our people. All Russian murderers, every organizer of this aggression, everyone who in any way sustains the war against our country and terror against our people must be punished. And this is not just a dream of justice. This is work that is already underway. These are agreements that we are already reaching. These are institutions that are already working and will work even harder to restore justice, to punish those responsible for aggression. The world is strong enough to punish Russia for the war. And we will provide the world enough courage and tools to make the punishment happen. Our confidence in this matter grows stronger with every passing week. And I thank all our partners who help build a network of legal cooperation to ensure that the relevant verdicts are delivered and implemented. The second important result of this week is the energy sector, the start of preparations for the next heating season. It is already underway. We are working on all scenarios and will do everything to be ready to face any threat next winter. In six months, our energy sector, government officials, the security and defense sector, and all those involved in the implementation of the relevant tasks must do very specific things. Strengthening the protection of energy facilities, restoring the infrastructure that has been destroyed by Russian strikes over the past six months, and giving our people more opportunities as part of the energy system decentralization project so that they can generate and supply electricity on their private territory, at their private facilities. This is a big undertaking, and it has already begun. The third result I would like to point out. International relations. Contacts at the highest level with Brazil have been resumed. I spoke with the new President of Switzerland. There were also contacts with the Netherlands, Latvia, Estonia, the European Parliament and other EU institutions. Over the past week, we have reached new agreements with all of them, new movement towards our common goals, and new potential for cooperation. And, of course, this week is another week when our warriors and everyone who helps defend the state made Ukraine&#x27;s victory even closer. They repelled assaults, destroyed the occupier, undermined enemy positions and logistics, and protected our borders and cities. I am grateful to all those who are currently in combat! I thank everyone whose life saves the life of Ukraine! Today I would like to pay special tribute to the bravery, strength, and invincibility of the warriors fighting in Donbas. It is one of the toughest battles. Painful and challenging. The 93rd separate mechanized brigade &quot;Kholodnyi Yar&quot;, the 77th separate airmobile brigade, the 56th separate motorized infantry brigade, and the 5th separate assault regiment. Our National Guard and border guards are also there. The 3rd operational brigade of the National Guard. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kramatorsk border guard detachments and consolidated detachments &quot;Dozor&quot;, &quot;Volyn&quot;, &quot;Chernihiv&quot;. Thank you, guys! I thank all the soldiers, guardsmen and border guards who are defending our country in the Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Avdiivka, Siversk, Svatove, Lyman and Zaporizhzhia directions. I am also grateful to every volunteer who helps our guys keep their resilience! I am thankful to all our medics and nurses who save the lives and health of our fighters! We are already preparing for the next week, and there will be new results for Ukraine. We will endure, drive out the invaders, and bring them to justice. Ukraine will emerge victorious! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The occupier is killing for the very fact that we are Ukrainians, for the mere word about Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-06</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I started the day with a meeting of the Staff. A detailed meeting. We reviewed the situation in the operational directions, at each key point of hostilities. The Commander-in-Chief, commanders, and intelligence delivered reports. There was a special report on the situation in Bakhmut, around the city, and more than an hour-long conversation. In fact, it was the topic of Bakhmut that became the main topic for this meeting. I want to be honest about such topics. Unfortunately, there are many different disinformation messages. From those who don’t even have access to absolutely confidential discussions about defense, but claim something about some alleged decisions on defense issues. Society must understand the meaning of our defense operations, the true meaning. Today at the Staff meeting, I directly asked both Khortytsia commander, General Syrskyi, and Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny about their view of the further defense operation in the Bakhmut sector. Either withdrawal or continuation of defense and reinforcement of the city. Both generals replied: do not withdraw and reinforce. And this opinion was unanimously backed by the Staff. There were no other opinions. I told the Commander-in-Chief to find the appropriate forces to help the guys in Bakhmut. There is no part of Ukraine about which one can say that it can be abandoned. There is no Ukrainian trench in which the resilience and heroism of our warriors would be disregarded. The occupier kills for the very fact that we are Ukrainians. For the mere word about Ukraine. For our dream of Ukraine. For our lives - the lives of Ukrainians. And we are destroying the occupier everywhere - wherever it yields results for Ukraine. Bakhmut has yielded and is yielding one of the greatest results during this war, during the entire battle for Donbas. And I thank every soldier who is fighting in this most difficult area. Who is fighting for all parts of our country, in all directions. We are defending and will continue to defend every part of Ukraine. When the time comes, we will liberate every city and village of our country. And we will hold the occupier accountable for every shot against Ukraine, for every meanness against Ukrainians. If we can do it legally, then we will do it legally. If we can do it with weapons, then we will do it with weapons. Due to our unity, due to our determination, due to the fact that we value the whole of Ukraine and every Ukrainian, we know exactly the outcome of this war. We have known it since the first days of the war. In Ukraine, we will always hear: &quot;Glory to Ukraine!&quot;. And millions will always respond: &quot;Glory to the Heroes!&quot;. It will always be like that. Ukraine will not forget the feat of each and every one whose lives gave freedom to Ukraine forever. Today, a video has emerged of the occupiers brutally killing a warrior who bravely said to their faces: &quot;Glory to Ukraine!&quot;. I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: &quot;Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!&quot; And we will find the murderers. I thank everyone who is now fighting for Ukraine! I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! Eternal memory and honor to all those who gave lives for freedom for our people! Eternal memory and honor to all Ukrainian heroes of different times who dreamed and fought for freedom for Ukraine! Ukraine will emerge victorious! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukraine will always remember its heroes, our memory of them will endure, and our enemy will perish - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-07</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today, Dmytro Kotsiubaylo, &quot;Da Vinci&quot;, Hero of Ukraine, volunteer, man-symbol, man of courage, was killed in action. A fighter of the 67th separate mechanized brigade, a commander of a battalion. He was killed in the battle near Bakhmut, in the battle for Ukraine. Since 2014, he has been defending our independence and the dignity of our people. One of the youngest heroes of Ukraine. One of those whose personal history, character, and courage have forever become the history, character, and courage of Ukraine. For more than nine years, Ukrainian heroes have been fighting for Ukraine&#x27;s future in fierce battles for the country. Peace and relative safety in the rear cities is their feat. Our confidence in Ukraine&#x27;s victory is their resilience and strength. Ukraine will always remember its heroes. Our memory of them will endure, and the enemy that came to Ukraine will perish. The 67th brigade, warriors, glory to your bravery! All Ukrainians who are fighting for Bakhmut, glory to your heroism! I am grateful to all the warriors whose resilience and perseverance destroy the occupier&#x27;s army in Donbas! Today, I would like to praise the 10th separate mountain assault brigade, 56th separate motorized infantry brigade, 93rd and 54th separate mechanized brigades for their results. Glory to you, warriors! The marines of the &quot;thirty-fifth&quot;, the paratroopers of the 79th air assault brigade, the 55th artillery brigade, our gunners. Glory to you, warriors! Our border guards, the National Guard, intelligence, security forces operating in Donbas... Glory to all those delivering results for Ukraine in the toughest battles! Glory to every soldier, sergeant, officer, and general who is in combat with their men! We are doing everything we can to liberate our land as soon as possible, to put a historical end to the attempts to deprive our state and our people of their freedom. All the activities of our state and everyone who helps are aimed at this goal. Today I would like to thank our entire team involved in the exchanges once again. Budanov, Yermak, Klymenko, Usov, Lubinets. 130 warriors were brought home from Russian captivity. And all 130 are privates and sergeants. The Army, Navy, National Guard, border guards, and other parts of the defense forces. Just as we remember every corner of our country that is under occupation, we remember every single person in Russian captivity. We will release everyone. I thank all our soldiers on the frontline who realize how important it is for us, for Ukraine, to replenish the exchange fund. No matter what, we have to endure. No matter what, we must remember all our heroes. Glory to all Ukrainians who are now in combat! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are doing everything to ensure that our tactical steps contribute to the strategic goal - the success of Ukraine – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-08</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report of the day. I held a meeting with the military and intelligence. The frontline, our defense, the battle for Bakhmut and the entire Donbas. This is the first priority. We are doing everything to ensure that our tactical steps contribute to the strategic goal - the success of Ukraine in the battle for the entire temporarily occupied territory of our state. And I am thankful to each of our warriors who are fighting. Fighting for Ukraine, for their brothers-in-arms. I thank all those who are defending positions, all those who are repelling attacks, all those who are helping those fighting next to them with their fire. It is very important that the frontline is not a line on the map, it is people, it is resilience, it is willingness to fight, it is support for each other, it is help for each other. And it is help of our entire nation for those who are now in combat. Help from all those who provide logistics for the front and for the warriors. From everyone who volunteers for our heroic combat brigades and other units of the defense forces. From everyone who works and pays taxes so that Ukraine can endure. Every day at all levels in Ukraine should bring benefits for our defense. We are also preparing new and quite just steps by our state against those in Ukraine who are still trying to weaken the state and undermine the strength of our society. A new meeting of the National Security and Defense Council will soon take place, and we have relevant draft sanctions decisions. Ukraine&#x27;s internal security is also a top priority. Today, UN Secretary-General António Guterres visited Kyiv. We had important talks. The key issue was protection. Protection of Ukraine and the entire international order. The issue of peace - for us and for the world. Condemnation of the aggressor. We discussed with Mr. Guterres the situation with our people held in Russian captivity. These are captured Ukrainians, as well as deported adults and children. We have to return them all. We discussed the situation at Ukraine&#x27;s nuclear facilities and the relevant threats posed by Russia. We discussed food security and Ukraine&#x27;s global role as a guarantor of food stability. It is in the interests of our country and all conscientious states of the world that food exports from Ukraine are maintained. And, of course, I outlined my vision of the capabilities of the UN institutions and the UN Charter that can contribute to the implementation of the Ukrainian Peace Formula - all of its points. And one more thing worth mentioning today. I want to thank everyone who has been holding Ukrainian flags in the squares and streets of Georgia these days. I want to express gratitude for our national anthem that was played in Tbilisi. This is respect for Ukraine and I want to express my sincere respect for Georgia. There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success. We want to be in the European Union and we will be there. We want Georgia to be in the European Union, and I am sure it will be there. We want Moldova to be in the European Union, and I am sure it will be there. All free nations of Europe deserve this. Glory to all those who are now fighting for Ukraine! Glory to all those who are fighting for their brothers-in-arms! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>No matter how treacherous Russia’s actions are, our state and people will not be in chains – address by President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-09</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I held several meetings on the consequences of a massive attack on our infrastructure. Another attempt by the terrorist state to wage war against civilization has led to temporary power, heat and water outages in some of our regions and cities. Russian missiles have claimed the lives of six Ukrainians today. My condolences to the families... Restoration work at power facilities has been ongoing all day. Kharkiv and the Zhytomyr region have the most difficult situation. Odesa, the Dnipropetrovsk region, Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia are also facing difficulties. Repair crews, power engineers, local authorities and the central government - everyone will work for as long as necessary to restore power supply to the cities and districts where there are problems. I thank everyone who is working for this. We have already shown what Ukraine is capable of. And no matter how treacherous Russia’s actions are, our state and people will not be in chains. Neither missiles nor Russian atrocities will help them. I want to thank all the warriors of our Air Forces today. And especially the 138th Dnipro, 160th Odesa and 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, which distinguished themselves in the defense against this Russian attack. Thank you, warriors! I am also grateful to everyone in the world who realizes how important it is to give full protection to the Ukrainian sky, and to everyone who is ready to help us guarantee normal life for people. Today I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, in particular, about energy support for Ukraine. I informed her about the consequences of the attack by the terrorist state. I am grateful to Mrs. Ursula for the relevant assistance provided. Of course, we also discussed the issue of putting pressure on Russia for terror. Sanctions pressure. Ways to expand sanctions. By the way, as a result of this strike, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from the power grid again. This is a critical situation. And Russia is deliberately creating such critical situations at our nuclear facilities. This simply means, by definition, that Russia cannot be a bona fide participant in any relations in the nuclear sphere. This means that the sooner the Russian nuclear industry is subjected to sanctions, the safer the world will be. A terrorist state cannot be allowed to use any nuclear facilities anywhere in the world for terror. Mrs. President of the European Commission also positively assessed the progress of our country in the anticorruption area. In particular, the approval of the Anticorruption Strategy and the appointment of a new NABU Director. This is important in the context of our further progress in European integration before the start of negotiations on Ukraine&#x27;s membership in the European Union. Today I also had a rather long meeting with representatives of our cultural community. Theater, cinematography, music, literature, state cultural institutions, public initiatives. The Shevchenko Committee and Ukrainian journalists were represented. We discussed ways to strengthen the capacity of Ukrainian culture to communicate with the world to ensure support for Ukraine. Diplomacy, journalism, and culture are the three areas that do the most to make the world understand our struggle and help us. Of course, we also talked about our own national needs. It is very important that the experience of a full-scale war, our soldiers, what they are going through at the front, the experience of Ukrainian trenches, the experience of our people who are actually defending European freedom, that all this experience be described by Ukrainians. So that our culture, its figures, its institutions, could fill the need for a Ukrainian cultural product, for an understanding of the Ukrainian situation. Ukraine has achieved the greatest national unity in its history. Ukraine has united the world. Ukrainians inspire hundreds of other nations with the way they defend their country and freedom. And it would be right that all this is reflected by Ukrainian culture, our institutions, and our people. Ukrainian cinematography, Ukrainian theater, Ukrainian literature, Ukrainian music, Ukrainian museums, Ukrainian visual art. So that all of this preserves the true experience of those who are going through the war, who are on the frontline, who are really experiencing what “Keep fighting – you are sure to win!” means. Many ideas were voiced today. There are things that the state can and should do. There is something that depends on the cultural community itself. I thank the participants of the meeting once again. And I thank all the Ukrainian cultural figures for this year and for all the years of Ukrainian independence, when we have grown stronger. Glory to all those who are now fighting for Ukraine! Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Kupyansk, Lyman and the entire Donbas! Our Zaporizhzhia, Nikopol, Kherson region! Glory to all those who are defending our Sumy, our Chernihiv region, our Kharkiv region, all our cities and communities, and our border! Glory to every Ukrainian soldier whose courage means the life of Ukraine! Eternal and blessed memory to all those whom this war and Russia have taken from us! There is no other choice but to win. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Ukrainians are strong when they take care of each other, and free when they defend themselves – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-10</span></div>
  <p>The meeting of the Staff of Supreme Commander-in-Chief has just ended. The commander-in-chief, commanders of the task forces reported on the situation on the front line, generally in the defense of the state. East and south, border. Bakhmut and our opportunities to strengthen there. Our responses to terrorist attacks. Protection of Kherson and communities of Dnipropetrovsk region. Chernihiv region, Sumy region. Our ammunition and supply needs. Today, I spoke about the provision of Ukrainian soldiers and, in general, the support of our state in defense against Russian aggression during international negotiations. The Prime Minister of Finland, a country that quite actively supports us, visited Kyiv. I thanked him for the aid packages already provided, we discussed new opportunities to strengthen our defense, increase pressure on Russia – a new defense package for Ukraine, already the 14th. We also talked about cooperation in the European Union structures, and supporting our initiatives to punish Russian murderers. Today, I also met with the Minister of Defense of Norway. In general, we have achieved an extremely strong relationship with Norway in many areas. This also concerns weapons: thanks to Norway, we strengthened our air defense, artillery, and other types of troops. Norway also launched a long-term budget support program for Ukraine – $7 billion for five years – which can and should become an example for our other partners. We discussed additional steps that we can take together with Norway to make this spring a success both for Ukrainian defense and for the prospects of pan-European security. By the way, we are starting to communicate with Norway about the possibilities of a training mission for our pilots. I talked today with representatives of the American political community – senators, experts – at the site of the American Enterprise Institute. It is one of the strong American think tanks – institutions involved in policy-making. I briefed on the current situation, our possibilities to break Russian aggression and return security to Ukraine. I thanked America for its unwavering and principled support, and the leadership that can bring our victory much closer. Today, I would like to pay particular attention to our soldiers who are defending Ukraine in Donetsk region. Every day they give good reasons for gratitude, give good results for Ukraine. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate marine brigades, the 55th separate artillery brigade, paratroopers of the 79th brigade... Thank you, soldiers! And separately, I would like to thank today the soldiers of the Defense Intelligence Shaman unit – for Bakhmut, for their strong participation in the defense of the city. Thank you to the soldiers of the 44th separate artillery brigade, who are fighting near Zaporizhzhia. Skillfully destroy enemy positions and equipment. Thank you guys for this! Today, I signed another decree on honoring our soldiers with state awards. In particular, soldiers of the 24th separate assault battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Today, I had the honor of handing &quot;Da Vinci&quot; Dmytro Kotsiubailo his Cross of Military Merit to his mother. Farewell to Dmytro took place today. And I thank everyone who came to the farewell ceremony for &quot;Da Vinci.&quot; To everyone who would like to come, but is currently at the front, in the army, in the hospital. It is very important. It is important that Ukraine honors its heroes and demonstrates to the world what kind of people give their lives for the freedom of our people and the whole of Europe. I&#x27;m grateful to everyone. Remember Dmytro today, please remember all those who were taken from us by this war – since February 24, since 2014. Eternal memory to the heroes! And one more. All day I receive reports about the restoration of our energy facilities and networks after the Russian terrorist attack. Kharkiv – many subscribers are still disconnected, the city has communication problems. It was possible to provide electricity to critical infrastructure, all services are working to restore the energy supply to consumers. Truly heroic efforts of our energy workers and repair crews. Kharkiv region – as of evening, electricity supply has been restored to most consumers. It is still not easy in Zhytomyr: although the system has generally been balanced, there may still be outages. Energy workers are working. Zaporizhzhia – everything is being done to protect people and the city&#x27;s energy system. Kyiv – heating networks are being restored. I thank everyone who is involved in these works, thank everyone who helps! Ukrainians are strong when they take care of each other. Ukrainians are free when they defend themselves. Glory to our beautiful people! In memory of our soldiers who gave their lives for our country! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Aid to Ukraine now is an investment in global peace, real architecture of security – President&#x27;s address to American Enterprise Institute World Forum participants</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-10</span></div>
  <p>Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! This is a great opportunity to talk to you. Thank you! I am going to tell you a story about two destinies – about two of our soldiers, Ukraine is giving the last honors these days. Two different, but so similar destinies. Today in our capital, in Kyiv, people said goodbye to one of the most respected soldiers of Ukraine, Dmytro Kotsiubailo, call sign &quot;Da Vinci&quot;. He was only 27 years old. He was a battalion commander in one of the combat Brigades that are currently defending our city of Bakhmut, our Donetsk region and the whole of Ukraine from the Russian evil. He died fighting. A man who dreamed of being an artist – that is why his call sign was &quot;Da Vinci&quot; – became a warrior. Because the war has come. Yesterday we also learned that Oleg Drobotsky gave his life in the fight for Ukraine. He was 26 years old. Another man who was destined to be an artist, he was known as a cool artist, but who became a warrior. Because we had to defend freedom. Every day we lose Ukrainian sons and daughters in a war that Ukraine did not start. People who could be artists or politicians, businessmen or journalists, scientists or diplomats. Anyone, but – to be alive! If not for Russia. Thousands of Ukrainian lives were ruined by this criminal war. Whole families die from Russian artillery strikes, missiles and deadly Iranian drones! Thousands of Iranian drones! In the east of Ukraine, in Kyiv, in the west of our country – very close to the Polish border. Everywhere. Why did Russia come to our land? Did they even have a fair reason to start this war? There was none. This is an obvious war of tyranny against freedom. At the root of this Russian war is hatred and the desire to rob a neighboring nation – the Kremlin&#x27;s desire to erase our identity, steal our land, our resources, our culture. For the first time in many-many years, Europe sees how evil deliberately and cynically attacks churches, steals even farmers&#x27; grain and equipment, killing their owners. Already more than 5 thousand Russian missiles, more than a thousand killer Iranian drones, mostly Iranian, have been used by Russia against our cities. Hundreds of destroyed Ukrainian schools, Ukrainian-language books burned by the occupier, shot teachers and representatives of local self-government, thousands of Ukrainian children kidnapped from their parents and taken to Russia, Ukrainian women and men and children abused by the Russian soldiers... including sexual crimes against them. All this suggests that Ukraine will continue to defend itself in this battle. While the occupier is on our land, while our cities are threatened with destruction, while the lives and freedom of millions of Ukrainians are at risk – we must continue this battle. And we will stand. And I know we will endure. Together with you. Our unbreakable stance, our principled nature, and the help from our friends, above all – the United States of America, which is a global leader in the defense of freedom, are the guarantee that evil will not win this battle. Evil should not go any further. Every Ukrainian life sacrificed for freedom is a saved life of our neighbors: Poles, Lithuanians, Moldovans and other free European nations. We have to talk about it frankly. The Kremlin never, never wanted to stop by conquering only Ukraine. Never! Other European states – your allies in Europe, the peoples in Asia – they are as much targets for Russia as Ukraine. Russia does not recognize any borders, and there is no such tyranny that does not claim the global destruction of freedom. So, it is reasonable to defeat Russia now, to free Ukraine, to guarantee the security of Europe, to save from this Russian genocidal evil any other nation that could be threatened. Defeating Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine means not fighting anywhere else in Europe and along the Russian borders. All the aid that is currently given to Ukraine is, in fact, an investment in global peace, in a real architecture of security for freedom. And, of course, I thank the American people for exactly such help to Ukraine. I mean support with weapons, and budget support, and support with sanctions against Russia and against those who are its accomplices. When we propose the Peace Formula, and Russia again responds with missiles on cities, this definitely suggests that the decision will be on the battlefield. And the world will become safer, it will definitely become safer. Both for nations and for people. Both for states and for business. The world will be safer when tyranny loses and when other potential aggressors see the full power of freedom. Our brave soldiers, as you said, our brave soldiers have already made it so that the Russian army ceases to be a global threat just in front of our eyes. We have to get this job done. It is possible to do this year! The right of men and women to be happy and live their lives – must prevail. The sanctity of the family must prevail, not some tyrannical empire. The opportunity to give future to children, and not to some invasive doctrine. Freedom must win. We all want our sons and daughters to choose the way in life they dream of. God forbid that this should be the way of such a war. I thank you for your attention! Thank you very much for your support! Thank you to all Americans who dream with us that evil has no chance! I met with representatives of both parties of Congress, both houses, with President Biden, his team – I met in Washington, in Kyiv. And I am sure that America will not betray freedom. The world has something to rely on. Glory, glory, glory to all who are now fighting for freedom! Glory to everyone who helps! Слава Україні! Thank you so much!</p>

  <h2>Russia has become a synonym for terror and will become an example of defeat and fair punishment – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-11</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! Today, I would like to support all those cities and communities of ours facing brutal terrorist attacks by the evil state every day, every night. Our Kherson region and the city of Kherson, on which the occupier is seeking revenge for its loss. Our Zaporizhzhia. Our cities of Donetsk region and Luhansk region, which Russia wants simply to burn. Our Kharkiv region and the city of Kharkiv. Only since the beginning of this year – in less than two and a half months – over forty enemy missiles have already struck Kharkiv. Nikopol, Marhanets – our Dnipropetrovsk region. Our Sumy region. Our Chernihiv region. Missiles and artillery, drones and mortars – the evil state uses a variety of weapons. But with one goal. To destroy life and leave nothing human. Ruins, debris, shell holes in the ground are a self-portrait of Russia, which it paints where normal life reigns without Russia. Today, Russian shelling took the lives of people in Kherson who simply went to a store to buy groceries. Three Ukrainians died. My condolences to the relatives! In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian missile hit the city&#x27;s life support facility. In the border areas, the occupier fired at villages to intimidate people, to drive people away. But Russia will not be there. It has become a synonym for terror and will be an example of defeat and fair punishment for this terror. The punishment that the Kremlin cannot stop. Today, I thank our fighters of the Pivnich task force for destroying a terrorists&#x27; missile and a Shahed. Fighters of our air defense in Chernihiv region, fighters of the 2nd separate regiment of the National Guard in Sumy region – thank you, guys! Thanks to all our fighters in the south, who are destroying the warehouses, logistics and positions of the occupiers! Every blown up enemy position is a saved Ukrainian life. Khortytsia task force... Today, I would like to especially mention the 92nd separate mechanized brigade named after Ivan Sirk, the 80th brigade – our paratroopers, the 5th separate assault brigade... All of them, together with our other soldiers, are defending Bakhmut. Thanks for the strength! We&#x27;ve got a lot to thank the 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after Hetman Mazepa and the 81st Separate Airmobile Brigade operating in Donbas. Well done, guys! Thanks to everyone who helps our units! Thank you to everyone who supports our civilians in the frontline and border areas! Thank you to everyone who is convincing the world that it is necessary to show more determination right now! Now, when we are preparing our active actions against the occupier, so that every shot at Ukrainians will be a responsibility of the terrorist state. And one more. Our new sanctioning step against individuals and legal entities associated with the evil state. The relevant decree has been published. These are more than 280 companies and 120 people who, through gambling business schemes, worked against Ukraine, withdrew funds from our state and financed various Russian schemes. It took some time to prepare the decision. It has been thoroughly worked out and closes schemes worth tens of billions. And it is not the last such decision. Ukraine will defend itself everywhere. And by all civilized means. Glory to everyone who is now fighting for our country! Glory to everyone who helps! In memory of all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Now is the time when Ukraine can overcome all historical difficulties if we preserve our unity - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-12</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I spoke with the new President of the Czech Republic, Pavel. A good conversation, a conversation of partners. We discussed defense against the terrorist state, our joint defense of Europe. I thanked him for the support already provided by the Czech Republic. There are things we can still do together. I invited Mr. President to visit Ukraine. Overall, this week was, as always, active for Ukraine. Visits by the Prime Minister of Finland, the Minister of Defense of Norway, UN Secretary-General Guterres, leaders of the ruling German Social Democratic Party, and a conversation with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. All of this yields results. In particular, we have significantly strengthened air defense - I thank Norway for this; we have new agreements on the diplomatic front; there is movement on the European integration track - as a result of the implementation of anti-corruption steps set out in the recommendations of the European Commission, including the appointment of a new Director of NABU. I would like to express gratitude to our power engineers for this week, to all the repair crews, local and central authorities who were involved in the elimination of consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on Thursday. As of today, we have managed to restore the technical capabilities of electricity supply. Kharkiv has electricity. Zhytomyr region has electricity. All cities and communities that had problems with energy supply have been powered again. I thank each and every person who worked for this! By the way, our program for exchanging old lamps for new LED lamps is also being actively implemented. In total, Ukrainians have already received 12 million LED lamps. Speaking of energy saving, this volume allows us to save up to 600 megawatts of energy. This is roughly equivalent to more than half of the generation of the most powerful nuclear power plant unit. Please take advantage of this lamp exchange program. I would like to thank our rescuers from the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, and in the border areas of Sumy and Chernihiv regions. To all those who are consistently eliminating the consequences of Russian shelling. Today, I would like to commend the 41st state fire and rescue unit of Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region. Major Herman Starcheus, Captain Serhiy Kulinchenko, junior sergeants Roman Dychko and Kyrylo Sayenko. Thank you guys for your excellent work and courage! Of course, I am grateful to all our warriors from Khortytsia and Tavria who are fighting in the hottest spots in the most difficult conditions. In less than one week - since March 6 - in the Bakhmut sector alone, they managed to eliminate more than 1,100 enemy soldiers, which are Russia&#x27;s irreversible losses, losses there, near Bakhmut. In addition, at least 1,500 more sanitary losses of the enemy - these are wounds incompatible with continuing fighting. Plus, dozens of units of enemy equipment were destroyed. Plus, more than ten Russian ammunition depots were burned. I am grateful to every warrior of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence - the Shaman fighters, the National Guard, our border guards - everyone who is really fighting for Ukrainian land, for Bakhmut! I am grateful to the fighters of Tavria who are effectively fighting in the areas of Avdiivka and Maryinka. To the artillerymen of the 55th separate Zaporizhzhia Sich brigade, the warriors of the 35th separate marine brigade, the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion, and our Seventy-Niners - the paratroopers! And also the Zaporizhzhia direction of Tavria - the 128th separate mountain assault brigade. Thank you all, guys! I am grateful to each and every one who again helped our soldiers this week, treated them after their injuries, searched for things to support them with, organized volunteer fundraising and sent to the front what they asked for! Together, in unity, we will achieve victory. This week there is also a movement to strengthen our spiritual independence. Society sees this. And I see the approval of Ukrainians for these steps, which are quite legitimate. And we will continue this movement. We will not allow the terrorist state to have any opportunity to manipulate the spirituality of our people, to destroy Ukrainian shrines - our Lavras - or to steal any valuables from them. And one more thing. Today is the 160th anniversary of the birth of the outstanding Ukrainian scientist Volodymyr Vernadsky. A man who lived in a very difficult time, but who, despite everything, believed in Ukraine, chose Ukraine, and helped Ukraine. We are now living in a time when Ukraine can overcome all historical difficulties. We can do that! If we preserve our unity, take care of each other and our country. I thank everyone who cares about Ukraine and Ukrainians! I thank everyone who cares about our unity and the unity of the world for the sake of Ukraine! I thank each and every one who is now fighting for the independence of our country! May the memory of all those who gave their lives for Ukraine be eternal! All those whom we remember when we say &quot;Glory to Ukraine!&quot; Today I conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine upon Oleksandr Matsiyevsky, a soldier. A man whom all Ukrainians will know. A man who will be remembered forever. For his bravery, for his confidence in Ukraine and for his &quot;Glory to Ukraine!&quot; Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will do everything possible and impossible to strengthen our warriors - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-13</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report of the day. I held important coordination meetings. The Prime Minister, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, our international experts, and the Office&#x27;s domestic political bloc. We agreed on a course of action for the coming weeks. In particular, the government has approved and proposes to the Verkhovna Rada to adopt amendments to the state budget, with more than half a trillion hryvnias allocated for defense additionally. All funds will be used to provide financial support to the military, to support our defense sector, and to buy defense equipment, including drones. We will do everything possible and impossible to strengthen our warriors. Today we also discussed humanitarian demining, something that is vital, literally. As of now, more than 170,000 square kilometers of our territory remain dangerous because of enemy mines and unexploded ordnance. A significant part of this territory is the land of our farmers, the land that has been cultivated. So today we discussed how to intensify this work: to speed up humanitarian demining and increase cooperation with partners. We discussed how to support our farmers. The second sowing season has already started during the full-scale war. Last year, the heroic efforts of our farmers and all workers in the agricultural sector made it possible to preserve Ukrainian agricultural production and Ukraine&#x27;s global role as a guarantor of food security. And I thank everyone who contributed to this. The government is working on appropriate steps to support the industry. We also discussed the situation in the energy sector, which has been normalized. In fact, we are meeting the energy needs of Ukrainians throughout the entire free territory of the state, in accordance with the generation capabilities. We continue to prepare for the next heating season, both in terms of accumulating resources and protecting our energy facilities. The coming weeks are planned to be quite active in terms of international communication. Both in order to strengthen our defense and to strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s position in the fight for justice, that is, in the fight to punish Russian murderers. We are preparing news. We are also working to add new sanctions against Russia. Recently, Canada took a significant step by expanding sanctions on imports of Russian aluminum and steel. I thank Canada for this decision - for this signal to the international community. We must not only limit the capability of the terrorist state to circumvent existing sanctions, but also impose new ones to prevent Russia from adapting to global pressure. The less Russia&#x27;s ability to adapt to sanctions, the sooner we can restore the territorial integrity of our country and return peace to Ukraine. And, of course, our defense forces. Our soldiers and global pressure on Russia are the only effective guarantee of protecting the freedom of Ukraine, Europe, and the free world. As always, today I was in touch with our commanders and intelligence. It is very tough in the east, very painful. We need to destroy the enemy&#x27;s military might, and we will. Bilohorivka and Maryinka, Avdiivka and Bakhmut, Vuhledar and Kamyanka - and all other places where our future is being decided. Where our future, the future of all Ukrainians, is being fought for. I am grateful to each and every one who is now in combat! Thank you to everyone who defends their positions and fights for Ukraine and brothers-in-arms! Thank you to everyone who never lets down those who are next to them on the frontline! Today, I would like to commend the warriors of the 92nd separate mechanized brigade for their successful actions in the area of Bakhmut. Thank you, guys! Glory to all Ukrainian warriors! Glory to our unbreakable and beautiful people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The strength of our defense and security forces is in the strength of our people - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-14</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today is quite an emotional day. I had the honor of presenting state awards to our warriors and the families of our warriors on the occasion of the Day of the Ukrainian Volunteer. To the mother of the Hero of Ukraine Oleksandr Matsievskyi. To the father and wife of the Hero of Ukraine Taras Bobanych. To the men and women who defend our country, standing up for it at the call of a pure Ukrainian heart. Today&#x27;s decrees honor 363 Ukrainian volunteers, 47 of them posthumously. Hundreds of thousands of our people have become Ukrainian volunteers since February 24 and since 2014, defending Ukraine from Russian aggression. Millions are helping! They are searching for everything necessary for defense, healing and rehabilitating the wounded, rescuing after Russian strikes, and working for Ukraine and Ukrainians. The strength of our defense and security forces is in the strength of our people. And the strength of Ukrainians and the state as a whole is based on the fact that Ukrainians become warriors at a crucial time - they do not lose their grip, they fight, they do not seek what doesn’t belong to them, they do everything to regain their own. We will win this war. We are doing everything for this. We support each other. We reinforce the state. We unite the world for the sake of our victory, which actually consists of the actions of all those who are fighting for Ukraine, who are fighting for our country and for their brothers-in-arms, who are doing everything in order not to let the enemy take either our land or Ukrainian glory. I would like to express special gratitude for this chevron, Da Vinci chevron of Hero of Ukraine Dmytro Kotsiubailo, which was handed over to me today by Ms. Alina Mykhailova. And for another chevron from the guys, which was handed over at the ceremony. It is an honor for me. Thank you. I held a meeting of the Staff. There were reports from the Commander-in-Chief, intelligence, and commanders of directions. The main focus is on the Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops and Bakhmut. There is a clear position of the entire Staff: to reinforce this direction, to inflict maximum possible damage upon the occupier. General Tarnavsky then reported on the Tavria, which is part of the Donetsk and southern directions. General Moskaliov reported on the situation for the Odesa operational and strategic group of troops. General Nayev reported on the North. Of course, we are constantly considering the supply of ammunition and weapons at the Staff’s meetings. We are constantly working with our partners to increase pressure on Russia. Today, Mrs. Prime Minister of Iceland paid a visit to Kyiv. A country that helps Ukraine politically and humanitarianly, that adds its voice to the global coalition of defenders of Ukraine and freedom. We discussed cooperation in the Euro-Atlantic and European directions, in international structures. One of the key issues is the punishment of the terrorist state and all Russian murderers. We are preparing for the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe to be held in the capital of Iceland, which may be of great importance for bringing Russia to justice for its aggression. Today, I also spoke with Mr. Murdoch, CEO of Fox Corporation and Co-Chairman of News Corp, one of the leading media organizations in the United States. A year ago, on this very day, a group of journalists working for Fox came under fire from the Russian military in the Kyiv region, in Horenka. Pierre Zakrzewski and Oleksandra Kuvshynova were killed, and Benjamin Hall was seriously wounded. In total, dozens of media workers have been killed and injured in a little over a year. We value every life, and we remember each and every one of them. Honoring them, honoring all those whose lives or health were taken by this war, we are making every effort to bring the end of Russian aggression closer. To bring the punishment of the terrorist state closer. We are making every effort to bring the Ukrainian victory closer. Glory to all those who are now fighting for our country! Glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Blessed memory and eternal honor to all those whose lives were taken by Russian shelling and strikes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Now we feel that the Russian aggression is approaching the point where it can break - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-15</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a fruitful international day for our country, for our defense. Another meeting in the Ramstein format was held, the tenth one already. Ammunition for our warriors, artillery, tanks, protection of Ukrainian skies - all this was discussed. There are solutions. I am grateful to the United States, which coordinates Ramstein, and all of our partners for their unflagging willingness to help. This is especially important now, when we feel that the Russian aggression is approaching the point where it can break. There is no terrorist that can build up its potential in confronting the free world. Russia is no exception. We must constantly increase the pressure for terror. Pressure in our defense, in sanctions against Russia, in destroying the ways the Russian state and its companies circumvent sanctions, in political and legal pressure. The more pressure we put on them, the faster we will move towards restoring our territorial integrity and international legal order. We are doing everything for our partners to feel this. This necessity to continue pressure. Step by step. Without ceasing. I would like to thank Denmark separately today. Both for the new defense package for Ukraine and for the decision to establish a special fund to help our country in the amount of DKK 7 billion, which is USD 1 billion. It is extremely significant. It is extremely necessary. I am grateful to the Danish government and parliament, to the entire Danish society. Such decisions ensure that we can speed up the return of peace to Ukraine and stability to the whole of Europe. There is also an important decision in London today - in the case of the Kremlin bribe to Yanukovych back in 2013. When Russian money and dirty schemes with the then-politicians in Ukraine were actually used as part of the aggression against our country. An aggression that began back then - politically, economically, and later with the use of the special services and military force. It is in this context that the $3 billion bonds case should be considered. Fully considered. And this is fair. I addressed the participants of the powerful British conference of the Society of Editors. This is a gathering of leading media professionals in the United Kingdom, authoritative journalists, authoritative editors. People who have actually dedicated their lives to freedom - freedom of speech. I urged them to spread the truth even more actively about Russian aggression, about our people whose lives are being destroyed by Russia, about our defense, which is returning freedom and security to Ukrainians and all Europeans. Journalists - the free media of Ukraine and the world - have done a lot during this war to make Russian terror lose. To make Russian propaganda lose. And I want to emphasize: they did it simply by spreading information about what is happening here and now in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world. They were just spreading the truth. This must be continued. The Kremlin will never defeat the truth. Neither will it defeat Ukraine. I met with representatives of the American magazine The Atlantic, one of the most prominent global media brands. I met with the owner of the magazine, Mrs. Jobs, the editor-in-chief, Mr. Goldberg, and Anne Applebaum, an authoritative journalist. We had a very meaningful conversation. In particular, about how we use modern technologies to reinforce our warriors and our institutions. About our army of drones, which will only get bigger and more powerful. About our IT specialists who help protect Ukraine. About the threats posed by Russia in the cyber and information space. The world must know that the terrorist state seeks to bring destruction not only to our people, but also to all peoples who want to be free. Of course, I am constantly in touch with our military, with the commanders. Everything we do, everything the state does, is subordinated to one task: to give each of our warriors more capabilities to fight, to give each of our cities more security. As always, today I would like to commend our warriors who are delivering results in critical areas of the frontline. Of course, Bakhmut. Of course, Donetsk region in general. But also the south. And Kharkiv region. We do not forget about any of the directions of state defense. The 54th and 92nd separate mechanized brigades - guys, thank you for your resilience and strength in Bakhmut. The 3rd operational brigade of the National Guard and our border guards, who are fighting for Bakhmut together with all units of the defense and security forces... Thank you, warriors! Thank you for your courage and for replenishing our exchange fund. The 15th separate regiment and the 1st presidential operational brigade of the National Guard - I thank you for your results in the battles for the cities of Donetsk region! The border guards of Kharkiv region - thank you for your strong counteraction to the enemy! The 406th separate artillery brigade and the 131st separate reconnaissance battalion - thank you, warriors, for the defense of Kherson region! Thank you for your powerful responses to enemy strikes at Ukrainian cities. The occupier must be destroyed. Thank you to everyone who makes this possible! Glory to each and every one who is now in combat! Glory to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: All Rashists will be held accountable for every Ukrainian life taken</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-16</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! A year ago, the Russian military committed one of the worst crimes of this war. Russian bombs destroyed a theater in Mariupol. A building that was used as a shelter. There were women with children, pregnant women, and the elderly. A civilian object deliberately destroyed by the occupier. We still don&#x27;t know the exact number of victims. Hundreds of people? A thousand? The inscriptions &quot;Children&quot; next to the building clearly indicated who became the target for Russia. One of many such targets. The evil state will be held accountable for each of them. In mid-March last year, the occupier was still in the north of our country. In many places in the Kharkiv region. The enemy had completely different positions in the south. But already then we began to drive them out. The day will come when we will liberate Mariupol. Our entire south. Our entire east. Just like we liberated our other cities. The day will come when a tribunal will be established to bring justice to our people. A tribunal that will punish this aggressor in the same way as the aggressors of the past were punished. The day will come when all the perpetrators of war crimes against Ukrainians will be brought to justice in the halls of the International Criminal Court and national courts. We will do all the legal work. We will mobilize all the partners that are necessary for this. This is already being done. Every day we bring justice closer to Ukraine. We work for this every day. The Prosecutor General and his Office, Ukrainian law enforcers, special services, the government, diplomats, my Office. Rashism will not be able to remain unpunished evil. There will be punishment. And if some terrorists hope to hide somewhere... It will not work for them. All those who bombed Ukraine. Who burned our villages, who shelled Ukrainian cities... Mykolaiv, Kherson, Nikopol and Marhanets, Zaporizhzhia, cities of Donbas, Kharkiv, Kharkiv region. All those who carry out terrorist fire against the communities of Chernihiv and Sumy regions... All those who brought the war to Donetsk and Luhansk. All those who tried to enslave Crimea. All Rashists will be held accountable. They will be held to account for every Ukrainian life taken. Eternal memory to all our people, all adults and children whose lives were taken by Russian terror! Today I spoke with the British Prime Minister. Generally, we talked about how to increase our defense capabilities. As always, it was a very concrete conversation, and I thank Rishi, I thank all the British people for their unflagging and attentive support. There will be the results of the conversation. Our warriors will see them. Today I also met with the Prime Minister of Latvia in Kyiv. I thanked him for the new defense package for our country, for the principled support at all levels - from weapons to politics, from sanctions against Russia to legal issues. We are constantly working on two directions of our foreign policy - European and Euro-Atlantic. With all our partners. With officials and public figures, with politicians and all other communities that have influence. I thank Latvia for supporting Ukraine on both of these paths. The European Union and NATO. Today we spoke with Prime Minister Kariņš about the respective prospects for this year. Ukraine has always been Europe. Ukraine will always be Europe. Russian bombs will not change the objective reality. The reality that Ukrainians are defending. I thank everyone who is fighting now near Maryinka, near Bakhmut, near Avdiivka, in Luhansk region, on the frontline in the south. I thank everyone who makes Russia admit the fact that responsibility for evil is inevitable. Paratroopers of the 79th brigade - I am thankful to you today as well! The 35th and 36th separate marine brigades - thank you guys! Warriors of the 55th separate artillery brigade - well done! The 74th separate reconnaissance battalion - thank you! I thank the warriors of the National Guard who are fighting in the east together with all our defense forces. Battalion groups of the Central and Western operational and territorial units of the National Guard - thank you, guys! Zaporizhzhia direction: the 128th separate mountain assault brigade and the 44th separate artillery brigade - as always, well done! Kharkiv region: the 3rd separate tank Iron brigade, the 1st separate Bohun special forces brigade, the 127th separate brigade of the territorial defense - thank you, warriors! Glory to each and every one who is now fighting for Ukraine! I am grateful to each and every one who brings accountability for the evil state closer! All of Ukraine will be free. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>International Criminal Court issues warrant of arrest for Putin; the historic decision, from which historical responsibility will begin – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-17</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today, we have a fundamental decision of international justice. In a case which has a true prospect. The International Criminal Court issued a warrant of arrest for Putin. The historic decision, from which historical responsibility will begin. The head of the terrorist state and another Russian official have officially become suspects in a war crime. The deportation of Ukrainian children – the illegal transfer of thousands of our children to the territory of the terrorist state. Over 16,000 cases of forced deportation of Ukrainian children by the occupier have already been recorded in criminal proceedings investigated by our law enforcement officers. But the real, full number of deportees may be much higher. It would be impossible to commit such a criminal operation without the order of the top leader of the terrorist state. Separating children from their families, depriving them of any opportunity to contact their relatives, hiding children on the territory of Russia, throw them in remote regions – all this is an obvious state policy of Russia, state decisions and state evil. Which begins precisely with the top official of this state. I am grateful to the team of Prosecutor Karim Khan and the International Criminal Court, everyone in the world who is helping us in the fight for justice. I am grateful for integrity and willingness to really bring to justice those who are guilty. So far, it has been possible to return a little more than 300 children from all those who were taken away by force, stolen from Ukraine. It is obvious that we have to return everyone. It is obvious that we will continue doing everything for this. For returning every Ukrainian, every Ukrainian woman, every our child. And for the real responsibility of all those responsible for this deportation – from the head of the terrorist state to all the executors. I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The main focus is on the battles in Donbas: Avdiyivka, Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Maryinka, Bilohorivka. The main focus is on our soldiers, how to support our brigades, how to give them more strength, opportunities, more weapons and protection. As always, the Commander-in-Chief, intelligence, task force commanders reported. The commander of Khortytsia group General Syrsky, the commander of Tavria group General Tarnavsky. It is these groups that operate in Donbas. And I thank every soldier, every sergeant, every officer – everyone who acts on the front line, everyone who maintains a real defense with their endurance and courage. Thank you for resilience, for strength and for the fact that the state sees a prospect for our defense operations, for further active actions. Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the fighters of our special units. Special Operations Forces – 8th Separate Special Forces Regiment, thank you guys for the filigree destruction of the enemy near Bakhmut and the powerful reinforcement of our defenses in this direction, in Bakhmut. Thank you to all our Special Operations Forces fighters who defend Luhansk region. Special gratitude goes to our Navy SEALs, the Naval Special Purpose Center, for the successful actions in the south, for the tangible losses of the enemy near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, for the powerful response we give to the occupier to its attacks on our forces and cities. Thank you to the soldiers of the Security Service of Ukraine. To all our defenders from the Alpha unit, in particular from the White Wolf and Kusto groups. The 13th Directorate of SSU Military Counterintelligence – thank you all! Thank you to the soldiers of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense – every soldier, every unit. I thank the soldiers of our International Legion, all who feel the need to fight for freedom in the same way that Ukrainians feel this need. I spoke today with the Prime Minister of Slovakia. I thanked him for the new and strong defense support package. In particular, for MiG fighters, which will fly for the security of Ukraine and the whole of Europe. We agreed to continue our security dialogue – in Ukraine. And, by the way, we are already working on the next weeks&#x27; tasks – the time that we will use to strengthen Ukraine, to supply new weapons to our soldiers and to speed up the punishment – the punishment of Russia for this war. Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine! Glory to everyone who helps us protect our people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>When Ukraine defends itself, when the power of justice are restored on our land, it will guarantee peace for many other parts of the world as well – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-18</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! There are new NSDC sanctions. More than 400 individuals and companies. Most of them are Russian. It is the defense industry of the terrorist state. But these are also Iranian, and Syrian individuals, those who help terror. We study in depth each of our sanctioning steps. Ukrainian sanctions are part of global pressure on Russia. All those who produce weapons for terror against Ukraine, who help Russia incite aggression, in particular by supplying Shahed drones, who support Russia&#x27;s destruction of international law, can only be marginals for the world. Those who will eventually be held accountable for everything they do against our people, against people in general, against international law. And this, by the way, will concern not only terror against Ukrainians, not only attempts to annex our land, starting with Crimea, but also other Russian aggressions against the international order, against normal, peaceful human life. In particular, on the territory of Syria. The people of Syria have not received adequate international protection, and this has given the Kremlin and its accomplices a sense of impunity. Russian bombs destroyed the cities of Syria in the same way as our Ukrainian cities. This impunity is a significant part of the Kremlin&#x27;s current aggressiveness. When the Ukrainian people defend themselves, when the power of the UN Charter and the power of justice are restored on our land, this will guarantee peace for many other parts of the world as well. It is what our global coalition, the anti-war coalition, works for. This week brought good weapon results for our resistance to Russian aggression. Another Ramstein meeting was held. There are new defense packages from our friends: Canada, Germany, France, Denmark, Estonia. They concern ammunition and accouterments, tanks and artillery. There is a much-needed solution to the Archer systems – Sweden, thank you very much. The decision on MiG fighters – Slovakia, thank you very much. Poland, Lithuania, the UK, the European Union, the United States, and many others continue to provide powerful assistance. I&#x27;m thankful to all our partners! A talk between Ukraine and the United States in an expanded defense format took place. The Minister of Defense, the Commander-in-Chief, the commanders of operational strategic groups – they are Generals Syrsky and Tarnavsky, the commander of the Air Force, and the head of the Office participated from the side of Ukraine. I joined this conversation. Our goal is obvious – it is strengthening our soldiers, new solutions for Ukraine to be able to take active actions and protect itself from Russian terror, to restore real security. These decisions will be made. There is only one subject that destroys life, and that is Russia. There is only one way to protect life – it is necessary to expel the Russian army from Ukrainian land. And we will do it. I thank all our soldiers of the Air Force, all our pilots, and anti-aircraft fighters who shoot down killer drones and missiles! I thank each unit of our defense and security forces, which responds to the occupier&#x27;s attacks on our cities. Dnipropetrovsk region, Kharkiv region, Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy region, and Chernihiv region – for each of our regions suffering from Russian terror, the occupier will tangibly pay with its losses. I will once again mention our soldiers in Donetsk region, those who cause the losses to the enemy the most. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, fighters of the 79th separate air assault brigade, soldiers of the 11th border guard detachment, the 55th separate artillery brigade, the 72nd separate mechanized brigade, and the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion... I&#x27;m thankful to you, warriors! I especially thank everyone who defends Bakhmut every day. The battles right there, exactly in these parts of Donbas – Vuhledar, Bakhmut, Maryinka, Belohorivka, Avdiyivka, Kamianka – make it possible to return security to Ukraine, to all of Europe, to every nation that values its freedom and the integrity of its land. Glory to all our soldiers who are now in battle! Glory to everyone who helps! Thank you to everyone who trains our soldiers, who treats injuries, who volunteers, and who supports the fighting spirit of Ukrainians! Glory to all of you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Expelling the occupier, clearing our land of traces of the evil state, punishing terrorists are our tasks that we will fulfill - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-19</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Another week of our defense against the evil state is coming to an end. Another week when every day, every night, the Russian army shelled Ukrainian cities, villages, and killed our people. Kamyanske in Zaporizhzhia region, Beryslav in Kherson region, Marhanets in Dnipropetrovsk region, Avdiivka, Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region, Kostiantynivka in Sumy region... And dozens and dozens of other Ukrainian towns and villages that have been hit by Russian terrorists this week alone. My condolences to all those who have lost their relatives, their loved ones... The evil state will be held accountable for every act of terror against Ukrainians. This week has finally brought a truly significant international legal result for Ukraine, for justice. There is a warrant of the International Criminal Court for the arrest of the Russian leader, and this is a turning point. The moment after which it becomes undeniable that the end of this aggression for Russia will be the full range of its responsibility. Responsibility for every strike on Ukraine, for every destroyed life, for every deported Ukrainian child... And, of course, for every manifestation of destabilization of the world caused by Russian aggression. These days, our United24 charity platform has crossed the $300 million mark in donations. From people all over the world - more than a hundred countries, thousands and thousands of donors. Ordinary people, private companies that help buy drones for our military, buy ambulances, rebuild hospitals and infrastructure. And this is one Ukrainian charity platform. One of the various initiatives that bring the world together. The world understands what is happening. The world sees how bravely and nobly our people are fighting. And that is why we manage to mobilize the support of both the leading powers and billions of human hearts around the world. I am grateful to each and every one who believes in Ukraine and who helps us restore security! I would like to praise our people who are clearing Russian mines and unexploded ordnance left by the occupier. This is a daily painstaking and very dangerous job. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, our pyrotechnics and explosives specialists have already inspected more than 100 thousand hectares of territory. Over 400 thousand enemy shells have been neutralized. More than 200 thousand explosive items have already been removed. I am thankful to everyone involved in this! And I would like to commend the pyrotechnics of the State Emergency Service. Oleksandr Dvoretsky from Ternopil and Roman Shutylo from Luhansk region, who have been working in Kherson region for almost six months in a row, returning security to Ukrainians. Thank you! I am grateful to Roman Radavchuk from Kyiv region, who works in Mykolaiv region, demining energy facilities. I thank Vasyl Popovych from Chernivtsi for demining in Donetsk region. I thank Yevhen Zakharov from Kyiv for demining in Kharkiv region. I wish a speedy recovery to Yevhen Melnyk, Andriy Makoviychuk, Vitaliy Rudenko, Volodymyr Klyapchuk, Vladyslav Bak... These are pyrotechnics of the State Emergency Service who were clearing the territory of Kherson region and were injured. I am grateful to the explosives specialists of our police. Andriy Ilkiv and Taras Sal, who worked in the de-occupied areas of Kyiv and Kharkiv regions. I am grateful to Anatoliy Chechelnytsky for demining in Mykolaiv region. I am grateful to Ihor Zabolotnyi, Tetiana Kuzubova, Valeriy Onul, Maryna Ostrovska and Vyacheslav Iarovyi for demining in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Kherson and Kyiv regions. I am grateful to the sappers of the National Guard of Ukraine and our Armed Forces! Expelling the occupier, clearing our land of all traces of the evil state, and punishing terrorists are our tasks. Tasks that we will fulfill. We Ukrainians are united. And the world is united. Glory to all those who are fighting for Ukraine! Those who are fighting in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, those who are defending our south, those who are holding our border. Glory to all who are preparing the de-occupation of our lands! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror, Russian bombs, and Russian mines. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today we have several important defense decisions what is necessary to support our warriors – address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-20</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! We have several important decisions today, primarily defense decisions. Our European partners have agreed on a joint plan to accelerate the supply of shells for our artillery. This decision is worth 2 billion euros. It provides for both emergency supply and production of ammunition. This is a strategic step. It gives us confidence in our unity, in the immutability of the movement towards victory over the terrorist state. I am thankful to all our partners in Europe! To everyone who is truly interested in making Europe strong and free. A new defense package from the United States was also announced today. The amount is 350 million dollars. These are rockets for HIMARS, artillery shells and other ammunition - everything we really need to support our warriors. I am grateful to President Biden, Congress, and all Americans! I held three international conversations today. With Austrian Chancellor Nehammer, we discussed our bilateral cooperation - humanitarian and political issues. We also discussed our joint opportunities to restore justice violated by Russian aggression. I thanked Austria for joining the group that is preparing the establishment of a Special Tribunal on Russia&#x27;s aggression against our country. I also thanked Ireland - Mr. Prime Minister - for his country&#x27;s accession to this group. The circle of partners willing to work together to punish Russia for its aggression is inevitably expanding, making the prospect of punishment more and more realistic. It is not enough to bring to justice those responsible for crimes caused by aggression. It is also necessary to punish - quite fairly and legally - the original crime that gave rise to all the other crimes of this war. This is exactly what the Special Tribunal will provide. Every day we bring its creation closer. By the way, today this issue, as well as our joint work with the International Criminal Court, was discussed in London during the conference of European ministers of justice. I addressed the participants of the Conference and urged them to support all elements of international efforts to ensure that the aggressor is surely punished. It is very important that we discussed with both the Austrian Chancellor and the Irish Prime Minister the possibilities of medical treatment and rehabilitation of our people who were wounded by Russian weapons. With Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, we focused on defense issues, on quite practical steps that will help implement our Peace Formula. I informed him about the situation on the frontline, our main needs and capabilities. I thank Mr. Prime Minister for his full understanding of the situation and for his unwavering belief that the power of European values is stronger than Russia&#x27;s hatred of European freedom. Today, as always, I would like to commend our warriors. All those who are fighting for our country. The 56th and 57th separate motorized infantry brigades - thank you guys! Thank you for your strength and resilience in the defense of Bakhmut! The warriors of the 72nd Black Zaporizhian separate mechanized brigade, paratroopers of the 79th brigade, marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion, our artillerymen of the 55th Zaporizhzhia Sich brigade - I am glad to be able to steadily thank you for the results, for your strength, for your resilience in Donetsk region! Kherson direction... The 406th separate artillery brigade and the 131st separate reconnaissance battalion - well done, guys! Always accurate, always strong! I am grateful to each and every one who is now in combat! Glory to all who defend the independence of our country! Thank you to everyone who helps! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today, Ukraine began to mark the first anniversary of the first victorious battles of the full-scale war that made the occupier flee - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-21</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I have just spoken with the President of Chile, it was a good conversation. We updated our countries&#x27; vision of the current situation in international relations. I briefed Mr. President on how Russia continues its aggression. I also informed him about how we can counteract Russian terror and do so successfully. And the best proof of this is our experience. The experience Ukrainians have already gained in expelling the Russian occupiers. Thanks to the bravery of our warriors, thanks to the support of our partners who will never accept Russia&#x27;s desire to break the international legal order. Today, Ukraine began to mark the first anniversary of the first victorious battles of the full-scale war - the battles in the north of our country that made the occupier flee. It was on March 21 last year that the Battle of Moshchun, a small village in the Kyiv region, ended, and it was the first major step of our country towards victory in this war. There were other such steps... The Battle of Hostomel. The Battle of Irpin. Fighting in the Chernihiv and Sumy regions. The Battle of Zmiinyi. A fierce confrontation in the south of Ukraine and our unique defense operation that returned freedom to the Kharkiv region. We will achieve the same result in other active actions. In the heroic battle for Donbas, which will inevitably be dominated by the Ukrainian flag. In the subsequent confrontation in the south, which will restore normal Ukrainian life in the Azov region. In the return of our Crimea, from where the migration of the most far-sighted rats of the terrorist state has already begun. Our confidence in Ukraine&#x27;s victory, our vision of a free future for our country, Ukrainian heroism that has amazed the world - all of this was born there... In the heroic cities of the Ukrainian north, Ukrainian east, and Ukrainian south. In the cities of heroes whose character did not submit to the occupier for a second, even when the occupier came to their homes. Together, we are returning Ukraine to Ukraine. Together, we are protecting our future, our dignity, our freedom, and our history. Today, I honored the heroes of the Battle for Moshchun – for Kyiv – in the very place where a memorial will be built in honor of our warriors and ordinary Moshchun residents whose lives were taken by this brutal war. Today, the guest of our country, Prime Minister of Japan Kishida, began his visit to Ukraine with a visit to Bucha. To honor the memory of all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror. Mr. Kishida visited the Wall of Remembrance in Kyiv, near St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral, and honored our warriors who died for Ukraine. And it is very important when global leaders show courage by visiting Ukraine despite all the risks and show respect - respect for our people who are fighting not only for their country, for Ukrainian independence, but also for the preservation and functioning of civilized rules and civilized life in the world. Our talks with Mr. Kishida were quite productive. It should be borne in mind that this visit is taking place at a time of Japan’s G7 Presidency - the Group of Seven democratic states. So, given Japan&#x27;s strength, its leadership in Asia in defending peace and the rules-based international order, and Japan&#x27;s responsibility as the G7 chair, our talks today can truly yield a global result. We discussed security, political, sanctions, economic and humanitarian issues. Japan is ready to join our reconstruction, to be a leader in these economic and infrastructural processes. But today I also heard Japan&#x27;s very concrete willingness to work together with us to mobilize the world even more actively for international order, for the protection against aggression, against Russian terror. Thank you, Japan! Thank you to everyone who helps us defend freedom and liberate our land! Glory to each and every one who is now in combat! Glory to each and every one who is fighting for Ukraine near Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Vuhledar and all other hot spots of the frontline! Today, I held a meeting of the Staff. The main topic is the frontline. Our warriors, our positions, our reinforcement. The commanders, the Commander-in-Chief and the intelligence delivered reports. One of the issues that always receives maximum attention is the supply of ammunition and support from our partners. We expect an increase in supplies of exactly what we need right now. And one more thing. Today I would like to especially mention the 10th separate mountain assault brigade, the 54th and 92nd separate mechanized brigades, which are fighting in Donbas. Steadfastly, courageously and effectively. Well done, guys! Glory to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We will do everything to ensure that the blue and yellow colors continue their liberation movement - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-22</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today I have been working in the regions all day. Donbas – the frontline, our warriors, the region. The Kharkiv region after that - the situation in Kharkiv, on the border, in all districts of the region, restoration, protection of critical infrastructure. I started from the front, from the Bakhmut area. It is an honor for me to support our warriors who are defending the country in the toughest frontline conditions. I presented state awards, thanked our soldiers for their bravery, for their resilience, for Ukraine - which we are preserving thanks to such heroes, thanks to each and every one of them who is fighting against Russian evil. I paid a visit to the wounded warriors. I wished them - and I&#x27;m sure on behalf of all of you, all of our people - a speedy recovery. I thanked the doctors and nurses. And now I want to thank everyone who supports our soldiers recovering from injuries. Who helps with everything necessary, our doctors, everyone who works for rehabilitation after injuries. I am grateful to every volunteer, every partner of ours who helps! It is distressing to look at the cities of Donbas, to which Russia has brought terrible suffering and ruin. The almost constant, hourly air-alert siren in Kramatorsk, the constant threat of shelling, the constant threat to life... Right there, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv region - wherever Russian evil has come, it is obvious that the terrorist state cannot be stopped by anything other than one thing - our victory. And we will ensure it - the Ukrainian victory. In all areas of the east of our country, where there is a Ukrainian flag, there is also hope. It is felt. We will do everything so that the blue and yellow colors continue their liberation movement - returning normal life to our entire land, from Donetsk to the border. We will certainly respond to the occupier for every attack on our cities... Today&#x27;s Russian strikes at Zaporizhzhia, the night attack on the Kyiv region... All Russian strikes will receive a military, political, and legal response. Russia will lose this war. There is no subject in the world who does not feel this already. Everyone understands all this. And every Russian murderer should understand that an arrest warrant is the best thing that can happen to them. My condolences to all our people who lost their relatives and loved ones due to Russian terror! In the second half of the day, I, my team, the Head of the Office - we all worked in the Kharkiv region. Just as in the Donetsk region, I held a meeting on the situation in the region, on social and security needs. It is very important that Kharkiv stands strong. Well done! Thank you, people of Kharkiv! You hold on with confidence. The city lives, the city fights, Kharkiv gives strength to our entire east. I thank everyone who stayed in Kharkiv, who works, who gives work to others, who maintains security, protects the border! Thank you to everyone - in positions, at posts, at critical infrastructure facilities, utility workers, local authorities, businesses, educators... The representatives of the region informed me about some issues that must be resolved by the government for stable social security of all those who work for our people in the Kharkiv region. These issues were discussed. We also discussed issues of reconstruction, humanitarian demining, and restoration of energy networks. Everything that is within the competence of the government will be done for sure. And, of course, I was very pleased to hand over a special award to Kharkiv... Award of the hero city, a ribbon on the city&#x27;s flag denoting the special bravery of the people of Kharkiv. And one more thing. This evening begins the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims. A significant part of our Ukrainian Muslim community, the Crimean Tatar people, is forced to meet Ramadan under occupation, under the threat of Russian repression and abuse in Crimea, under shelling in other parts of Ukraine, and in frontline battles. I have no doubt that we will return freedom, respect, and security to our entire state and to all communities. And may the power of prayer in this holy month help us cleanse Ukraine of Russian godless evil, of those who truly believe in nothing, and that is why they are capable of such terror. Let the next Ramadan begin in peace and on the entire Ukrainian land free from Russia. Ramadan Mubarak! Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine and the people! Gratitude to everyone who helps every day! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>If Europe hesitates, evil can prepare itself for years of war, it is in your power not to allow this to happen - Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address to the participants of the European Council meeting</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-23</span></div>
  <p>Dear colleagues, dear Charles! I&#x27;m glad to greet you today as I always do, but in a slightly different format. Now I&#x27;m visiting the cities that Russia is trying to ruin. The cities of Donbas, our Kharkiv – one of the centers of the east of Europe, our Kherson – already liberated from Russian occupation, but suffering from Russian terrorist strikes. Now I&#x27;m on the train, on the way, taking every opportunity, to support the spirit of our people, to bring closer the time when we will be able to drive out the Russian terrorists further from Ukraine – these war criminals, who, as every one of you knows, are dreaming of bringing to your cities the evil they have brought to Ukraine. God forbid anyone in the world should see their cities empty because of the threat of terrorist attacks, such as Kramatorsk or dozens of other cities of Donbas. With destroyed houses – destroyed by Russian artillery. Houses with plywood instead of glass in the windows where people are still trying to live. Ruined villages, destroyed by shelling as in our Kherson region and in every place where Russian occupiers can reach. Desolate – because full of mines – fields… God forbid anyone should see it happen in his or her own country. Dear colleagues! No one knows for sure how long the war will last and which battles will bring us success faster and which ones will require more effort. But what is clear is that if there are no delays or stagnation in our cooperation, if our joint efforts are resolutely focused on Ukraine&#x27;s victory, the victory will be gained already this year. Time is important. Not only months and weeks, but also days are important. The faster we act together – the more lives we save. For more than a year of full-scale war, our cooperation with you has been steadily growing. Was there a destructive protraction between our steps? Yes, there was. But still, we were pursuing a common goal – we were acting to stop Russian terror. Our defense cooperation; the successful passing through the winter – without chaos and crisis; economic cooperation; ten EU sanctions packages against Russia; European assistance to international justice in holding Russian war criminals accountable... All of this is the evidence that Europe knows how to defend its values and has the courage to stand up to terror. I am especially grateful to those of you who are actively involved in the initiative proposed by Estonia and approved by all of you – to supply and manufacture shells for our artillery. The more often Ukrainian cannons hit the occupier – the less chance Russia has to implement its genocidal policy against Ukrainians and other Europeans. I am also grateful to those of you who support the work of the International Criminal Court and our efforts to establish a Special Tribunal for the Russian crime of aggression against Ukraine, as well as efforts to launch a Compensation Mechanism that will convert Russia&#x27;s currently seized assets into restoring life, disrupted by the Russian war, in Ukraine. But, dear colleagues, don’t you feel that we have fewer new successes than new protractions in our joint efforts? Unfortunately, this is the case. And the Kremlin sees this. This moves us further away from achieving peace. I will now point out five examples of protraction. First. While every hour on the battlefield counts, the protraction in supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine is already significant. This does not allow us to roll back the positions of Russian terrorists, in particular from Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and our other cities, which are constantly shelled by Russian long-range missiles. Only yesterday, and only in our Zaporizhzhia, rockets of Russian terrorists hit ordinary multi-storey apartment buildings. Dozens of families lost their homes, many were injured, there are dead... Ordinary people! My condolences to all relatives and friends of those whose lives were taken by Russian terror! There should be no protraction in transferring the weapons to our soldiers that can protect Ukrainians from terror – constant Russian terror. The second example. I&#x27;m grateful to Poland and I’m grateful to Slovakia for their decisions on MiGs for Ukraine. This will significantly strengthen the defense of our sky. But we need modern aircrafts – and this is exactly what we have been talking about. Is there rational motivation for the protraction in providing modern aircraft? Remember how many Russian threats there were when it came to the transfer of Leopards and other tanks – more advanced than those our soldiers had previously. These more advanced tanks are already in Ukraine. So, what did Russia do in response? We all have to get used to the fact that a terrorist state bluffs more often than it can escalate. All the evil against Ukraine and against the whole of Europe that Russia was capable of, it is already doing. The third example. The protraction with new European sanctions packages is becoming increasingly troublesome. On the one hand, global efforts are not yet sufficient to prevent Russia from adapting to the sanctions and from circumventing them through third countries. On the other hand, the EU is not signalizing to the world that sanctions against Russia will be increased further. The simple question is: how will third countries perceive this protraction? Those whose governments do not respect international law. Obviously, they may think that ignoring the sanctions will have no consequences. That&#x27;s why sanctions must be expanded. There cannot be even a slight hint of delaying decisions on sanctions. Moreover, there must be no slackening of sanctions – and especially under the manipulative cover of food security. Strong sanctions give the security, and the easing of sanctions is an invitation to new crises, including the food crisis. The fourth example – the Peace Formula, the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which I presented in the autumn, is the only realistic and comprehensive plan to restore Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity and guarantee security for our people and for the whole of Europe. We have been talking to you for a long time about organizing the Peace Formula Summit. I am ready to schedule the Summit in Kyiv for the near future. But we are all well aware that under the current circumstances, many leaders, unfortunately, will not be able to come to Ukraine. So, I urge you to help us with this. We could organize the Summit in one of the world&#x27;s capitals – in one of the European capitals. Wouldn&#x27;t this add to Europe&#x27;s global strength? It surely will. And the fifth point. Regardless of the level of severity of the Russian terror, whatever the aggressor plans, we continue to develop our institutions according to the standards of the European ones. Ukraine&#x27;s transformation into a modern, fully accountable to society, corruption-free and institutionally stable state continues. The results are obvious. We have withstood the war. Our institutions are functioning – despite everything. Financial system, banks, all public services, social sphere. It is critical that there is no protraction in bringing closer Ukraine and the European Union. This is important both for the protection of Ukraine and for the protection of the European system. This is in line with the objective need to constantly strengthen Europe, as only such constant strengthening guarantees true resilience. Ukraine is ready for a decision to start accession negotiations on EU membership already this year. The same readiness is needed from all of you – every leader in Europe. Ukrainians need to see your readiness and need to be motivated by it – to feel that the defense of European values by our soldiers is truly supported by the whole of Europe. Charles, dear colleagues! If the war can teach leaders affected by it anything, it is that honesty between allies guarantees victory. I have honestly pointed out five key threats – five reasons protracting this war and pushing peace further away. We have to do everything we can to avoid such protraction. And definitely – we can do it. Europe knows how to be decisive. I know that you can appreciate the value of time. Let each meeting, each discussion, each day of our work together bring the return of peace closer – bring closer the liberation of our land and all of Europe from Russian evil. If Europe hesitates, evil may have time to regroup and prepare itself for years of war. It is in your power not to allow this to happen. Together, we can liberate Ukraine from Russian aggression already this year. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support and assistance! Glory to all those who are fighting now for freedom! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>In the free territory of the Kherson region, more than 50 villages were almost completely destroyed by the occupier, but people are returning even to such villages - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-23</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I have returned from the Kherson region - my day was devoted primarily to this region of ours. The security situation: our responses to the enemy shelling of the Kherson region, counter-battery fighting and everything else that our soldiers do so that the occupier knows that we will not forgive or forget terror. Today, the Russian army struck again at the Kherson region, hit Beryslav - the local administration, houses, the museum... Even the historical museum in Beryslav is a threat to Russia for some reason... An absolutely mindless state, purely a terrorist state. Which we will neutralize. I held a long meeting in Kherson with all those responsible for the region: for defense, for the social situation. We separately and carefully considered the energy situation, the issue of recovery. In the free territory of the Kherson region, more than 50 villages were almost completely destroyed by the occupier. In some places, more than 90% of the buildings in the villages are ruined. But even in such villages, people return, and this is proof that life still prevails. Today I was in one of the largest such villages - Posad-Pokrovske. Once one of the largest, before the invasion of Russia. And we will do everything to make this village one of the largest again - we will do everything to rebuild our territories. I am grateful to everyone who helps restore the normality of life after the Russian evil. To everyone who, even in such difficult areas, continues to work and give work, to everyone who helps our soldiers. I especially want to thank everyone involved in demining. It is nice to see when the fields of the Kherson region, cleared of Russian mines and shells, are cultivated again, live again. Of course, there are still few such lands, and there is still enough work for our sappers and pyrotechnicians... But I am sure that we will cleanse our land of all the deadly manifestations of Russia. All of Ukraine will live. I am grateful to Finland, which today announced a new package of security support. Among other things, these are demining machines. Plus, of course, important things for our military on the frontline. I had the honor to present state awards today to our soldiers who distinguished themselves in the defense of the Kherson region and the whole of Ukraine. On the train of our &quot;Ukrzaliznytsia&quot; - by the way, I thank the entire team of our strong railway - I took part online in the meeting of the European Council, which took place in Brussels with the participation of the leaders of all EU states and the President of the European Council Charles Michel. I was very specific in this address. I pointed out the strong steps taken by the partners. But I also noted things that, unfortunately, do not allow us to speed up the liberation of the territories, do not allow us to speed up the end of the war. First of all, it is the supply of more effective weapons to our warriors - long-range weapons and modern aircraft, regarding which we still see a certain delay in the decisions of our partners. It is also important to move more actively in the direction of new and stronger sanctions against Russia for terror and new steps in our Ukrainian integration with the structures of the European Union. I am sure: the partners have heard Ukraine&#x27;s position. And one more thing. Today we have a result which we have been working on for some time. An agreement was signed on the opening of a representative office of the International Criminal Court in Ukraine. This step will allow international justice to be even more active in investigating the crimes of the Russian military on our Ukrainian soil. I am thankful to the entire team of the International Criminal Court, the Office of the Prosecutor General, our partners, everyone who helps the work of international justice - the investigation of Russian crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians. Glory to all who are now fighting for freedom! Glory to each and every one who defends our Kherson region, our Mykolaiv region, Odesa region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Zaporizhzhia, Donbas, Kharkiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region and all of our Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The enemy must know: Ukraine won&#x27;t forgive offenses against our people, won&#x27;t forgive these deaths and injuries – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-24</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today, I took part in two events of gratitude and respect for our soldiers – our defenders. Young officers graduated from the educational institutions of the National Guard of Ukraine. All of them go to the permanent defense and security forces, the units of our National Guard, which, together with all our soldiers, defend Ukraine. I am grateful to our boys and girls who have chosen such a path of service to Ukraine, to the future of the Ukrainian people – the path of officers. Thanks to all the families of our young professional soldiers for such sons and daughters. Patriotic, brave and effective, those who chose the opportunity to act for the defense of our state and people as their profession. Today, on the eve of the Day of the Security Service of Ukraine, I congratulated the staff of the Security Service of Ukraine, all our security service personnel. It is definitely worth noting: the Security Service of Ukraine is undergoing a fundamental internal transformation. The service was fully mobilized for the real defense of the state. And it is now giving Ukraine such results that each of us can only be proud of. The SSU staff is fighting the external enemy, neutralizing internal threats, putting a historical end to any attempts by Russia to manipulate Ukraine through agents. Today, I thanked all the SSU employees. And I am sure that the Service will give Ukraine even more results in defending the state. I had the honor to present state awards to soldiers from the SSU and National Guard ranks. I am sincerely grateful for the strength that can be felt in the eyes of our fighters. The strength of those who are able to win for Ukraine. I met today with a delegation from the World Bank. We do not lose a single day for international contacts, we work at all levels. The current support programs for Ukraine and promising new ones were discussed. Of course, we focused on reconstruction – everything that needs to be done in many Ukrainian cities and villages that suffered terrorist attacks by the occupier. Residential buildings, social infrastructure, the economic basis of life – all this needs to be rebuilt. And I thank the partners for understanding that timing and coordination of efforts are crucial. As always, today I will mention our fighters, who gave the best result in the past day. First of all, in Donetsk region. Glorious 72nd separate mechanized brigade named after the Black Zaporozhians – thank you, guys! Marines of the 36th brigade – well done! The 55th Separate Artillery Brigade Zaporizka Sich – thank you, soldiers, for your constant accuracy, real battle-hardened deeds! Marines of the 35th brigade and the 79th separate air assault brigade – thank you! Zaporizhzhia direction: the 44th Artillery Brigade named after Hetman Danylo Apostol – thank you for the accuracy! I would like to mention all our fighters who strike at the occupier in response to terror, who identify the enemy&#x27;s positions from which they attack our cities. Each destroyed terrorists&#x27; position is the saved life of our people. I thank the Armed Forces, intelligence, and Security Service personnel – everyone who is involved in performing this task... The fair fire response to those who are the source of terror. Such strikes as on Kostiantynivka today, as many other of our cities... The enemy must know: Ukraine won&#x27;t forgive offenses against our people, won&#x27;t forgive these deaths and injuries. All Russian terrorists will be defeated. Thanks to everyone who brings the Ukrainian victory closer! Glory to everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russia and its terrorist war! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Address of the President of Ukraine to the graduates of the Institute of the Navy of the National University &quot;Odessa Maritime Academy&quot;</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-25</span></div>
  <p>Dear our defenders! Dear our officers of the Navy of Ukraine! Thank you for protecting our state in the maritime defense sector – in the Ukrainian Navy and the coastguard of the State Border Guard Service. Ukraine needs a victory over the enemy at sea as well as on land and in the sky. Russian ships have already memorized the only prospect for them in Ukrainian waters. The Russian Black Sea flagship has already demonstrated what any vessel that threatens Ukraine would face, and it is only a matter of time before it repeats the fate of the Moskva ship. Our defense and security forces firmly proved that the Ukrainian Snake Island would not tolerate an enemy flag... And these are only three elements of the great battle for the sea, which is still ongoing and in which you, our dear graduates of the Odessa Maritime Academy, will take part and win. You have earned the right to lead truly heroic crews – those of our soldiers who bravely and extremely effectively defend Ukraine in the sea against overwhelming enemy forces. Please, always take care of your soldiers, protect them and Ukraine! Help everyone who is fighting next to you against Russian evil! Protect freedom of navigation, one of the fundamental elements of global security, and protect everyone who peacefully and legally uses Ukrainian territorial waters! And never forgive the enemy for any crime against our country and people! May the noble naval service be a glory to you, your families and our entire state! Thank you to all teachers and employees of the Odessa Maritime Academy for this graduation, the graduation of our officers and faithful service to Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>It is the full-scale defeat of Russia that will be a reliable guarantee against new aggressions and crises – address of the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-25</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Another week of defense is almost over, another week when Ukraine has become stronger. And when the enemy became even more isolated, even more hopeless. This week we have a decision on new defense support packages from the United States, Lithuania, Finland, and Germany. The Swedish Parliament has already approved the 11th defense support package for Ukraine. There is a security package and strong agreements with Japan – I thank Prime Minister Kishida once again for the productive visit. We received EUR 1.5 billion in macro-financial assistance from the European Union – the funds are already in the National Bank&#x27;s accounts. The Croatian government has adopted a program for treating and rehabilitating our wounded warriors. Greece joined the group of partners working on establishing the Special Tribunal. We are also moving in defending historical justice for Ukrainians: Iceland recognized the Holodomor famine as genocide of the Ukrainian people. Step by step, we are doing everything possible and everywhere so that Russian revanchism loses in every element of its aggression against Ukraine and the freedom of nations in general. Russia must lose on the battlefield, in the economy, in international relations, and in its attempts to replace the historical truth with some imperial myths. The Kremlin is losing in its efforts to spiritually enslave our people. It is the full-scale defeat of Russia that will be a reliable guarantee against new aggressions and crises. Again I would like to congratulate the Security Service of Ukraine – all employees of the Security Service of Ukraine – on your professional day. Everyone, who is currently in combat, at posts, in operative, agent, and investigative work. Everyone in the SSU, who, together with all the forces of our state, brings Ukrainian victory closer and defends our people. The training of our officers of the National Guard, the Navy, and our army ended last week. From Kharkiv to Vinnytsia, Lviv region, from Kyiv to Odesa. The National Academy of the National Guard, the Kyiv Institute of the National Guard, the Odessa Maritime Academy, and the National Ground Forces Academy completed a special training course for junior lieutenants... I thank all the teaching staff of our defense educational institutions, all parents, and mentors of new Ukrainian officers! I believe this year&#x27;s graduation will increase the glory of Ukraine and strengthen all of us – the entire state. Our government made several important decisions during the week. In particular, I would like to note the decision that steps up drone manufacturing. In general, this year at least UAH 20 billion will be provided to buy drones for our troops. And it is not the limit. There are also new decisions regarding reconstruction. The range of needs is very wide. Wherever I was this week on business trips, requests require significant resources. We will find these resources. Kherson region, Kharkiv region, Donetsk region, and every other region affected by hostilities will return to regular life. I would like to note separately the cooperation with the International Criminal Court. This week gave Ukraine an agreement to open the International Criminal Court country office. Both at our national justice system and international level, we are doing everything to make Russian war criminals answer for literally every attack on Ukraine, on our people. Of course, I thank each of our soldiers, everyone, who is currently in battle, everyone who defends our positions, defends our border, for the fact that Ukraine is going strong this week as well. From Bakhmut to Kherson region, from Avdiyivka to Kharkiv region... Thank you to everyone who fights the enemy, who rescues our soldiers after being wounded, who trains our soldiers, and who supplies everything necessary for Ukrainian defense! When every day gives our state a result, every such day makes the war shorter and our victory closer. Thank you to everyone who strengthens our Ukraine! Glory to all who fight for freedom for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>You can&#x27;t be mentally far from the war, support our warriors whenever possible - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-26</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today our National Guard celebrates its day, and it will be right if we all thank the National Guardsmen together. For the way the National Guard, together with all our warriors, is powerfully fighting for Ukraine. For strength and courage in the battle for Donbas. For the defense of Bakhmut and Avdiivka. For the heroic defense of Mariupol and Azovstal. For the battles in the Luhansk region. For the battles in the Kyiv region, for the battle for Kyiv. Together with all the defense and security forces of Ukraine, the guardsmen ousted the occupier from the northern regions of our country, from the Kharkiv region. They are holding the line in the south, in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Separately, I want to thank the Offensive Guard, which has already become an example of the exemplary formation of new brigades for the Ukrainian defense. During the full-scale war, almost 5,000 National Guardsmen have already been awarded state awards - precisely for their participation in battles, for bravery, for resilience, and for the military results achieved by the National Guard. 32 warriors of the National Guard were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. I thank all Guardsmen: soldiers, sergeants, officers, command! Thank you to everyone who helps the units of the National Guard, who trains soldiers, provides them with everything they need, helps with treatment after injuries, with rehabilitation. The strength of Ukraine is the strength of all those who fight for Ukraine and who help the warriors. And it is simply impossible to imagine our state’s might without the National Guard. Today there was a meeting with the military - a special military meeting, a special circle of participants. I also held meetings with the security sector, with intelligence. Defense, reinforcement of our protection - both from external threats and from internal threats. We’re preparing respective steps. Constantly, invariably, maximum attention is paid to the situation on the frontline. To the brutal battles that take the lives of our people every day and require constant mobilization of our state and society every day. It is wrong, it is unfair, when our warriors who come from the front have the feeling that for many in the rear, the war is allegedly already over. For those who are not just far from the Donetsk region or Nikopol, from Saltivka, from the border areas of the Sumy region, from Zaporizhzhia... But who are mentally far from the trenches, from the daily pain of Ukrainians. Now, just as it was a year ago, one cannot be mentally far from the war, although thanks to our soldiers, real hostilities are taking place geographically far from many. Now, just as it was a year ago, it is important that as many Ukrainians as possible help the defense of the state, help the accumulation of world support for our victory. Fellow Ukrainians! Support our warriors whenever possible. Don&#x27;t forget about volunteers’ fundraising campaigns and join when you can. It is very important for everyone who has informational influence to participate in informational work. This applies not only to journalists. This applies to everyone who can spread the truth about aggression. Who is capable of reminding the world about Ukrainian men and women who went through the occupation, through losses... About the fact that Ukraine is fighting for freedom and justice for our people and for all nations threatened by Russian tyranny. The world must hear as intensely as last year that the aggression against Ukraine continues. It must hear that ending the war already this year, liberating Ukraine from Russian evil this year is a joint task of the civilized world. Because civilized means, in particular, determined to defend civilization. I met with the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Orlando Bloom and the UNICEF team - an organization engaged in humanitarian support and protection of children. Orlando Bloom has been working meaningfully in this direction for a long time. He has already been to Ukraine, in our Donbas, even before the full-scale war. And he knows what this aggression has brought, how full-scale the world&#x27;s efforts must be to stop it, to restore Ukraine after the war. We discussed the issue of rebuilding our country, our school infrastructure. I appreciate this help. We agreed that our teams should work on several issues. In particular, this is the issue of the return of our children who were forcibly taken to Russia, this is the creation of bomb shelters for our children. And the third is the technical support of distance education in those areas and regions where it is impossible to study offline due to relevant threats. Today, as always, I will celebrate our warriors who gave a significant result to Ukraine over the past day, this day, and this week in general. The 57th separate motorized infantry brigade, the 5th separate assault brigade and the 93rd separate mechanized brigade - well done, guys! Thank you for your strength! The marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the warriors of the 55th &quot;Zaporiz&#x27;ka Sich&quot; artillery brigade - all in the Donetsk region - thank you for being the best week after week! I also want to celebrate today our warriors of the &quot;North&quot; operational and strategic group of troops, who protect the Sumy region and the Chernihiv region. This is the defense against attempts of subversive groups infiltration across the border, this is a cover for Ukraine from airstrikes, and this is a defense against the artillery of terrorists. Thank you to all our anti-aircraft gunners of the “North”, to all those who protect our state border, to all those who, with their courage and accuracy, make the enemy learn that the Kremlin will not conquer Ukraine. Glory to all our warriors who are in combat! Gratitude to everyone who helps the defense! Eternal memory and honor to all our warriors who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I held an away meeting of the Staff - in Dnipro, a strategic city in the center of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-27</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I have just held a meeting of the Staff - for the first time away, in Dnipro. Right here - in the strategic city of the center of our country, after visiting Marhanets and Nikopol, Zaporizhzhia, the frontline positions of our warriors in the Zaporizhzhia region. The commanders of the operational areas reported the actual situation. General Syrskyi, General Tarnavskyi - they were there in person. Those who lead the defense in the Donetsk region, in the hottest areas. There were also online reports by commanders of the operational and strategic groups of troops covering the south and the north. There was a report by the Commander-in-Chief and others. By the way, I want to thank the warriors of our intelligence for the powerful work today in Bakhmut, the &quot;Kraken&quot; unit, as always - top level. Well done, guys! At the Staff’s meeting, we discussed the overall situation in the frontline areas, the reinforcement and protection of our borders along the entire length of the front - from the Kherson region to the Kharkiv region. Every commander understands that the enemy must be held accountable for every attack on our cities and villages, on our people. For Slovyansk, for Kostiantynivka and Druzhkivka, for Avdiivka and Toretsk, for all the pain of Ukrainians - and not only during the full-scale war, but also since 2014. Dnipro has been our fortress for more than 9 years, all this time supporting the front and warriors. It is here, in Dnipro, that since 2014, thousands of our soldiers have been saved after being wounded. Dnipro concentrated the work of volunteers - from the first weeks of aggression in 2014. I thank you, Dnipro, I thank everyone here in the city who helps Ukraine stand, stand strong and beat the occupier. Today in Zaporizhzhia, I visited the site where Russian rockets hit residential buildings. Ordinary houses... Burnt, partially destroyed, unfortunately. Dozens of people were injured by this insane Russian strike. The terrorists knew exactly where they were aiming their missiles. High-explosive &quot;Smerch&quot;. At the houses. 37 people were injured, 2 died. My condolences to those who have lost loved ones... More than 400 people applied for help. Of course, Russia will be held accountable for this strike as well. It is for this that we cooperate to the maximum with international justice, mobilize the world to create a Special Tribunal for Russia&#x27;s aggression. All this will happen. Terrorists will be sentenced. Of course, we help those who lost their homes as a result of this and similar strikes. Local authorities and partners have the resources to provide people with first aid. And I thank everyone who implements the relevant programs quickly and without excessive bureaucracy. It was painful to look at what Russia did to our Marhanets, to our Nikopol. But our warriors, each and every one of them, who are now in the frontline positions, whom we visited today in Zaporizhzhia, know exactly what they need to drive the enemy out of our land. And it will happen. Today I paid a visit to our soldiers in the hospital, where they are recovering from injuries. Thank you to every doctor, every nurse, and all the volunteers who help save the soldiers. I met with IAEA head Rafael Grossi. The topic is clear: the security of our energy industry, our nuclear plants. First of all, the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which Russia still uses for radiation blackmail of the world. No other terrorist has reached such depths in his cynicism, in which Russia constantly seeks and finds a new bottom. Holding a nuclear power plant hostage for more than a year is the worst thing that could happen in the history of the European and in general global nuclear energy sector. The longer the Russian occupation of the ZNPP continues, the greater will be the threat to the security of Ukraine, the whole of Europe and the world. I am grateful to our partners, grateful to Grossi for understanding this and for supporting Ukraine in the relevant issues. And one more thing. We are already preparing for an important international event that will take place this week at the initiative of President Biden and the United States. Summit for Democracy. Ukraine will participate. Our position in support of freedom will sound strong, as always. I am thankful to everyone who helps our country protect freedom! Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! I am thankful to all our people in Zaporizhzhia, in Marhanets, in Nikopol, in Dnipro, in all the cities that Russia wants to destroy so badly and that stand so firmly! Together we will win. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>I am grateful to everyone who reminds that Russian aggression can end much faster if the world is faster - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-28</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I have returned from our Sumy region. Today I was in Okhtyrka, Trostyanets, Sumy, in the positions of our border guards. The impressions are special. The region is next to the enemy. The threat is constant. The shelling of our border is constant. But life, our people are obviously stronger than any fears. Recovery continues, business is gradually returning, and people are rebuilding their lives. I had the honor to present a special title of the hero city to Okhtyrka. A city that helped save eastern and central Ukraine with its resistance. I congratulated Trostyanets on the anniversary of liberation from the occupier. I held a meeting with representatives of local authorities in the Sumy and Chernihiv regions. There are issues that need to be resolved. They will be resolved. I held a meeting with the commanders directly responsible for the defense of the Sumy and Chernihiv regions. I also had a special conversation with the Head of the Border Guard Service. We talked about the defense of Sumy and our other regions, about strengthening the border guards who, together with all the defense forces, are fighting on the frontline. By the way, today I would like to celebrate our warriors of the Luhansk, Kramatorsk and Donetsk border guard detachments who are effectively destroying the enemy in the Bakhmut, Lyman and Avdiivka directions. Thank you guys! I would like to express special gratitude to the mortar crews and aerial reconnaissance of our border guard units in the Donetsk sector. Well done, warriors! Of course, I thank the Sumy border guard detachment. I paid a visit to them today, had the honor to talk to them and support them. Strong positions along the entire border with the terrorist state are a consequence of the strength of our people who are ready to defend the border at any time. Today we have a decision of the French Parliament, which recognized the Holodomor as genocide of the Ukrainian people. I am grateful for this principled and fair step, for spreading the historical truth to another European country. And one more thing. Today I want to thank each and every one who, at the call of heart, in different countries, on different platforms, in different words, but equally honestly and strongly reminds the world that Russian aggression can end much faster than is sometimes said. Faster, if the world is faster, if the world is more determined. The destroyed Ukrainian cities and villages along the border of the terrorist state, Russia&#x27;s constant blackmail and threats to destroy lives in other countries as well, the constant refusal to return to real peace and the mockery of basic international norms are all sufficient reasons to put pressure and fight, to not seek compromise and to care about the values of the world in a real way… In a real way! Achieving the result for freedom every day. Achieving the result for peace every day. Forcing Russia to suffer losses every day. I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! Glory to all who are now in the battle against terror! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Democracy needs victory already now - speech by the President of Ukraine at the plenary session of the second Summit for Democracy chaired by the U.S. President</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-29</span></div>
  <p>Thank you very much! Mr. President Biden, thank you for this summit – for another step in consolidating the world in defense of freedom. Dear colleagues! Now is a decisive time, and it is our joint responsibility – what exactly will determine this time. Will we pass on to our children and grandchildren the values of freedom that we have ourselves, or – will they have to fight for democracy from scratch? Modern generations of many democratic countries do not know from their life experience that freedom cannot be taken for granted. Most people can only learn about this from history textbooks – from the stories of wars of independence that took place generations ago and battles of freedom won by others. But the experience of the enemies of freedom is always fresh. They don&#x27;t refer to textbooks. They know how to break democracy and destroy life. It is enough for them to have the slightest feeling that they can go unpunished, and then evil acts. This is where the threat to our values comes from, this is why democracy is in danger. Ukraine knows what it is to fight for democracy right now. And let our experience of preserving freedom during total war help protect the free world: each of your peoples! When you see Ukrainian cities burned by Russian aggression and when you see brave Ukrainian soldiers that stop the movement of the aggression through our land, notice – what you are actually seeing. This is deciding the fate of not only Ukraine, this is deciding the fate of everyone who is used to living freely. Russian propagandists and accomplices lie that, allegedly, the West is fighting against Russia on the territory of Ukraine. It&#x27;s worth understanding – what is really going on. It is Ukraine that tyrannical Russia is able to reach with its bloody hands – with missiles and artillery, bombs and tanks. But the Kremlin&#x27;s ambitions do not end just where its hands reach. Russia has been at war with all of you for a long time – with the democracies of the world. It fights via disinformation, election interference, espionage, corruption exporting, cybercrime, by trying to trigger an energy crisis and price explosions in markets that will hit your people with insane electricity or gas bills. Look – the Kremlin is trying to turn even food provision into a weapon – blocks the sea to create a shortage in the global food market. Why is this happening? This is war, ladies and gentlemen. This is war precisely against freedom and democracy. Every foe of freedom acts in the same way. I emphasize: they act. The enemies of freedom have not lost a single year in recent decades! They channeled all their time and unlimited money, which they gained in trade with the free world, – to weaken and to corrupt and to undermine democracy. But have all the efforts of the free world been aimed at limiting the aggressive potential of tyrants and autocrats and at bringing them to legal responsibility for their crimes? Unfortunately – no. We have to fix it. Democracy must be able to act – and act in advance. Democracy must learn to be uncompromising in the face of evil. The spirit of democracy is to find a compromise, but this only works for internal freedom in a given country. We should get rid of the illusion that compromising with evil can give something to freedom. The enemies of democracy must lose, and only this can be the basis of true security for democracy. Embrace this Ukrainian determination! Ukrainian democracy maintains absolute internal unity even in the face of a total war against our people. To win – is our national goal. What does it mean to win? Our answer is clear: to preserve freedom, to preserve dignity, to preserve our land. But what is the strategy of the free world in relation to totalitarian Russia, which is looking for how to create more totalitarian allies in the world? Is there such a clear strategy? I will tell you what it should be. Clear answer: evil must lose the war. If it loses now, it will know that it will always lose everywhere. First. We should not think how to save Putin&#x27;s face in order to allegedly reduce the cost of fighting him. We should think how to preserve respect for democracy in those countries where freedom has yet to win. Second. When a fire breaks out, firefighters cannot wait months for fire trucks to be provided, or accept that fire hydrants should be mandatory only for short distances. It works the same way in war. The more restrictions on the defenders, the more casualties and destruction, because the flames of aggression know no bounds. That is why the defense of democracy must have all the weapons that will reliably guarantee the defeat of the aggressor. Third. Russians must contribute to protecting the world from the Kremlin, whose impunity they have tolerated. It is necessary to look for, freeze and direct for recovery not only individual assets of the aggressor state and individual related parties, but all assets of Russia and Russian wealthy who have traded silence for increasing their wealth. They must have a motive to act in defense of freedom, and to bring an end to this aggression and the Kremlin&#x27;s terrorist rule. Dear colleagues! War makes things crystal clear. These days I visited our regions near the frontline. There you can see what aspects of leadership are needed now. When our fighters repel the assaults near Bakhmut, they cannot wait for weeks before firing an artillery shot in response to the enemy&#x27;s actions. The fire must be immediate and neutralize the threat. All our decisions should be just as quick. But for some reason, sanctions against Russia are much slower than Russia&#x27;s aggression. Global pressure on the Russian elite is weaker than its motive to accept the Kremlin. Support for Ukrainian soldiers in the trenches is less far-reaching than the weapons of the terrorists acting against us. And your own willingness to defend your democracies is less resolute than the intentions of those who want a world war against democracy. Democracy needs a victory. Now! This year! Not some other time. Not over time. Now! And we are able to ensure this. Ukraine and everyone who helps. And I am sure we will! But act, act please, colleagues! Thank you very much for your attention! Thank you for your support, Mr. President! And to all colleagues! Glory to all who fight for freedom! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Greater unity is needed to defeat tyranny; the democratic world is capable of achieving it - Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s address</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-29</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A brief report of the day. I took part in the global Summit for Democracy at the invitation of President Biden, this is one of the most representative platforms for the protection of our system - the system of free peoples. This is the second such Summit. In general, we do not have so many representative opportunities in the world to talk specifically about democracy, about the protection of freedom in all its aspects. And it is good that now we have such an opportunity to join forces in order to find more energy, more prospects for democracy. The position of Ukraine, as always, is very specific, as practical as possible. And in almost all the leaders&#x27; speeches at the Summit, there were apt words of support for our country and our people. I am thankful for this to every leader, every nation who feels as we do that the values of freedom deserve the strongest protection. Now, thanks to Ukrainian courage, thanks to the leadership of the United States, President Biden, thanks to the Congress of the United States and everyone who works for the consolidation of the world, we have the greatest unity of democratic countries in a long time. And this unity, as we can see, is enough to fight for freedom. But to win against tyranny, greater unity is needed. I am sure that the democratic world is capable of achieving it. It is capable of winning. Democracy needs victory! As soon as possible. And all of us together: Ukrainians, all Europeans, our American allies, our friends on all continents - in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in Australia - will do everything to bring victory closer. The victory of Ukraine. The victory of freedom. The victory of the rules-based international order. I spoke today with Giorgia Meloni, head of the Italian government. I thanked her for her principles, for her determination, for the real European strength that is felt in her words and actions in defense of freedom. We discussed both bilateral relations and the general situation in our defense against Russian aggression. I informed her about the situation on the battlefield, about our needs. Already in the coming months, we can be more active on the frontline. And we will do everything to ensure that the support of our steps by the world is as effective as possible. Bakhmut. Today, we have something to thank our warriors for, warriors who are fighting in the Bakhmut direction. Fighting firmly and efficiently. I thank each and every one who is doing everything to increase the losses of the enemy there! And special thanks to the warriors of our Kost Hordiienko 57th separate motorized infantry brigade, 77th separate airmobile brigade and the glorious Kholodny Yar 93rd separate mechanized brigade. Well done, guys! We are already preparing for the events planned for the second half of this week. I held relevant meetings today. Ukraine has not wasted a single week during the full-scale war - we are constantly strengthening our state, our Defense and Security Forces, our confidence in advancing towards victory. Today, a step has also been taken to strengthen the spiritual independence of our state, to protect our society from the old and cynical Moscow manipulation of religion. Ukraine is the territory of the greatest religious freedom in our part of Europe. It has been so since 1991. It will always be so. I thank everyone who cares about Ukraine and our citizens! Thank you to everyone who supports the Ukrainian struggle for independence! Glory to our warriors! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Supporting our people now means understanding how important it is not to remain morally neutral towards evil - address by the President of Ukraine to the National Council of the Republic of Austria</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-30</span></div>
  <p>Dear leaders of Austria! Dear attendees! Mr. Federal President, Mr. President of the National Council, dear Austrian people! First of all, I want to thank your three cities, the hospitals of your three cities - Vienna, Linz and Graz. The clinics of these cities saved our people, children and adults, from the city of Brovary, Kyiv region, who received terrible burns as a result of the helicopter crash that happened in January this year. I thank everyone who helped Ukrainians then! It was an important manifestation of support when your Chancellor, Mr. Nehammer, and the Federal Government of Austria offered such assistance. We in Ukraine value every life and know how to be grateful to those who help us save people. Ladies and Gentlemen! Today is already the four hundredth day of the war that our country has to go through. Russia&#x27;s total war against our people and against everything that makes people human. Every day, unfortunately, every day we are losing our people in this war. Those who give their lives in the battles against the occupier for the freedom of Ukraine and all peoples whose land and potential Russia wants to take as part of its empire. We are losing people from terrorist attacks and bombings, which the Russian army is carrying out even in places from where Russian soldiers were forced to flee under the pressure of our defenders. We are losing the lives and health of our people from the explosions of mines and shells left behind by Russian terrorists. We are also losing people because, in particular, in some parts of our country, in the conditions of such a terrible war, it is currently simply impossible to provide medical assistance in a timely and complete manner. I will give you only one example - just imagine what it means and the number of other such large-scale dangers brought by war. One hundred and seventy-four thousand square kilometers of the territory of Ukraine are contaminated by landmines laid by the occupier and Russian shells of various types that have not exploded. This contaminated area is like two territories of Austria. These are hundreds of thousands of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, MLRS rockets, aerial bombs, mortar shells, which, without exploding, got stuck in the fields, in the remains of houses. And even tripwires with grenades, which the occupiers left specifically against civilians, ordinary people - in houses and cars, by the roadsides, in gardens and parks, in the cities... A hand grenade that one of the Russian soldiers disguised under a plastic cup. It was in the Brovary district of the Kyiv region. An under-barrel grenade, which the Russians placed in an ordinary house under the cover of a piano. It was in the city of Bucha. A hand grenade used to mine a cabinet in the kitchen of the house... The owner of this house was executed by Russian soldiers, his body was buried in the yard. It was also in Bucha, by the way. An anti-personnel mine, disguised as an apparently ordinary bag with stuff. It was in the city of Irpin, Kyiv region... A hand grenade, left in an ordinary house in a washing machine so that the explosion occurred just when a person simply opened the washing machine... It was in an ordinary house in an ordinary village of the Kyiv region. There are thousands of cases. Thousands when we demined. When we saved lives. Unfortunately, there are daily reports of explosions that have claimed lives and mutilated people. Just mutilated. And all this is part of Russia&#x27;s self-portrait today, which it creates with its aggression, its insane war. Dear leaders of Austria! Dear Austrian people! Please remember: when we appeal for support for Ukraine, we appeal to save lives. Ukraine never wanted and never took someone else&#x27;s. We are not interested in foreign land. We do not want to interfere in the lives of other peoples. Ukrainians never wanted someone somewhere on earth to suffer and, even more so, to die because of our soldiers. We seek safety, peace, freedom, happiness for our children in our Ukrainian home. We strive for international treaties and conventions that guarantee the security of peoples and the sovereignty of states to work. Is this a great aspiration? Is it something you can just ignore? Last autumn, I offered our Peace Formula. These are specific ten points. Quite realistic points that can restore the full force of the UN Charter and other basic international documents and stop this insane aggression, ensuring the liberation of Ukraine from Russian evil and the salvation of our people from what the occupiers are doing. And by the way, humanitarian demining is one of the elements of our Peace Formula. But what did the world hear and see from Russia in response to the Peace Formula? Another batch of lies, denial, another manifestation of evil. And I am grateful to you, Austria, for the fact that your response was even greater support for the Ukrainian people, our state, and international law. During this year of the war, several delegations of the Austrian Government and deputies of your National Council were in Ukraine. I was glad to have productive meetings with the Federal Chancellor of Austria, Mr. Nehammer, and with you, Mr. Federal President, when you recently visited Kyiv. I invite you, Mr. President of the National Council, and other honorable representatives of the Austrian Parliament to visit our country as well, talk with our people and see with your own eyes, in the de-occupied territory or in the frontline areas, what Russia is like today, what it brings to Ukraine and the world. To see it, to see and hear our people means to understand. Understand how important each voice in support of international law and Ukraine is when relevant issues are brought up for consideration by the UN General Assembly, the European Parliament or other international platforms. Every voice in support of sanctions and other global steps that deprive Russia of the opportunity to increase its aggression. Supporting our people now means understanding how important it is not to remain morally neutral towards evil. This is not about geopolitics, not about military-political issues. It&#x27;s about the fact that people always - always! - must remain human, always preserve humanity and civility. I thank you, Austria, for the humanitarian support for Ukraine. I am especially grateful to every Austrian who took part in the &quot;Neighbor in Need&quot; campaign - Nachbar in Not - we appreciate it very much. I thank you for your help in protecting our energy industry from Russian terrorist missile strikes. I thank you for supporting our efforts in demining our land and in healing and rehabilitating our people after all the manifestations and consequences of Russian aggression. And I am very much looking forward to that moment - that happy day when I can thank you, Austria, for your help in restoring peace on our land. And I am sure that Ukraine will win this war. I am sure that international law will work again. I am sure that the Ukrainian Peace Formula will help the world protect itself from other similar aggressions. And I am sure that - against all odds - we will preserve our humanity, our civility, our morality and our belief that evil will always lose. Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by the brutal Russian war! Thank you personally, Austria! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Four hundred days of our defense against full-scale aggression is a colossal path that we have endured together - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-30</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Four hundred days... Four hundred days of our defense against full-scale aggression. This is a colossal path that we have endured . All together - everyone who fought and fights for Ukraine. Who took care and takes care about the state and Ukrainians. Who helped and helps our logistics. Who strengthened and strengthens Ukrainian resilience. Ukraine went through the most terrifying days of that February. We survived this winter as well. There is a colossal effort behind these words... We passed last spring, which turned the tide of this war in favor of our defense. Last summer and autumn, we proved that the spring liberation of our northern regions was no accident. The battle for Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions... The return of the territories of our Kharkiv region, the return of Kherson, the defense of Bakhmut and Donbas in general - this is the heroism of Ukrainians that the world will not forget. We are preparing our next steps, our active actions. We are preparing the approach of our victory. What is the strength of Ukraine? If your intentions are good, the whole world will be on your side and help you. Today, on the four hundredth day of resistance, full-scale resistance, I want to thank everyone in the world who stands with Ukraine. Who shares our interpretation of freedom. Who supports our pursuit of justice. Who has the same strong conviction that we, Ukrainians, have... the conviction that the world should be based on rules, on civilized rules - on the rules of humanity, respect and peace. That is why Ukraine will win. Because freedom and justice, humanity and respect, peace deserved by the people must prevail. I thank all our soldiers and sailors, all our sergeants and first sergeants, all our officers and generals. I thank each and every one who holds this front - the front of protecting the best that humanity has. The front of protecting the best that you and I have - our Ukraine. United, invincible and forever free. I thank everyone who is currently fighting! Each and every one who is fighting to protect themselves and brothers-in-arms in neighboring positions! Thank you to everyone who cares about our brave warriors! Thank you to everyone who protects our cities and restores normal life in the areas where it was violated by Russia with its aggression and terror! I also thank everyone who helps the daughters and sons, wives and husbands, mothers and fathers of our people, soldiers and civilians, whose lives were taken away by this war, by Russia! Ukraine will win at the front. Ukraine will win in recovery. Ukraine will win in restoring justice. We will not leave a single trace of Russia on our land. And we will not leave any enemy unpunished either. We are preparing news about this. This day, like any of the four hundred, was as active as possible for me. Communication with commanders, with intelligence. Meetings regarding the internal situation. I made another appeal to the parliament of the partner country - to the Austrian parliament. And I thank Austria for the fact that Ukraine was heard. A productive meeting with the delegation of the German defense enterprise Rheinmetall AG... I am thankful to our partners for their willingness to cooperate with us in an even more meaningful way. Tomorrow will also be active. To the maximum. We will do everything so that the day comes sooner when I can thank you, dear Ukrainians, for our victory! Glory to Ukrainian heroes! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The main word today is justice, for our state and our people who suffered losses due to Russian aggression – address of President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-03-31</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians! The main word today is justice. Justice is for our state, for all our people who lost relatives, loved ones, lost health, home, and normal life due to Russian aggression, due to the terror of the occupier. Our special events took place in Bucha, on the anniversary of the city&#x27;s liberation, and in Kyiv. The summit and negotiations, the second United for Justice conference... All this is to speed up, to do more energetic global work for the tribunal over Russian aggression, for the sake of new International Criminal Court warrants to arrest Russian war criminals, for the sake of legal and fair sentences that all Russian murderers and executioners must receive. And they will receive them. One hundred percent. We will ensure it. We will find formats, we will find tools. I thank everyone who helps us with this. To every state, every leader, and every international organization. Today, representatives of almost fifty countries participated in our first Bucha Summit. And this is just the beginning. Thanks to the leaders of Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia, and Moldova who visited Ukraine today, and who personally supported Bucha – they honored the memory of all those who died in the city during the Russian occupation. And, of course, I thank our soldiers. Everyone who is fighting for Ukraine now. Everyone who has fought for Ukraine since 2014. Everyone whose lives literally give life to Ukraine. Ukrainians will endure this war. We will free our land and all our people from Russian captivity. And there will be a day when the world will hear that justice has been restored for Ukraine. There will be a new Nuremberg – against the ruscists. Glory to all Ukrainian heroes! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Today, the terrorist state began to chair the UN Security Council, and yesterday the Russian army killed another Ukrainian child – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-01</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! I signed two decrees on sanctions against those who work for Russian aggression. These are officials of the aggressor state, its defense industry – hundreds of companies – and collaborators. It is about more than 650 newly sanctioned persons. The NSDC will continue this work. And none of those who help terrorists, work for them, supply or manufacture weapons for terror – none will escape liability. The blocking of accomplices of terror, the isolation of the terrorist state, its defeat, and trials are what await all those who started and are waging war against Ukraine and the international order. By the way, this week Switzerland joined the tenth sanctions package of the European Union. It is important when the states that are neutral in the military-political sense nevertheless take a clear moral position towards Russian terror, towards Russia&#x27;s destruction of the global order based on rules. Only in unity can we preserve peace as the basis of international relations, and I thank Switzerland for the relevant decisions. I spoke today with President of France Emmanuel Macron. In detail, one hour. About the situation at the front, our political interaction, about how we are moving in implementing the Ukrainian Peace Formula. Thank you, France for your unwavering support. In general, the week brought a number of positive news for Ukraine, for our defense, and for defending the regular life of all free nations. Within the framework of the OSCE, work on the first separate international report, which will be dedicated to Russia&#x27;s forced deportation of Ukrainian children and attempts to assimilate our children, began. This crime committed by Russia is one of the most cynical and anti-human crimes of our time. Russia commits it systematically and calculates it, at the state level. Accountability for it will be systemic too. Accountability of Russia as a state and everyone involved. Thanks to Germany for the new steps in defense support that were taken this week. Thanks to Croatia for another defense support package. Thanks to North Macedonia for the decision on helicopters. Thanks to Slovakia, Slovenia. Thank you to Canada for the financial support, the funds have already arrived in the state budget of Ukraine. Thanks to the IMF for the new programme for Ukraine. The programme is approved. The size is more than $15 billion. This will help us preserve social stability. Unfortunately, we also have news that is obviously absurd and destructive. Today, the terrorist state began to chair the UN Security Council. Yesterday, the Russian army killed another Ukrainian child – a five-month-old boy named Danylo. From Avdiyivka, in Donbas, together with his parents who were injured. Russian artillery... One of the hundreds of artillery strikes that the terrorist state launches every day. And at the same time, Russia chairs the UN Security Council. It is hard to imagine something evident that proves the complete bankruptcy of such institutions... There is no such form of terror that has not yet been committed by Russia. And there will be no such reason that will stop the reform of global institutions, in particular, the UN Security Council. The reform that is clearly overdue – so that a terrorist state and any other state that wants to be a terrorist cannot disrupt the peace. Terrorists must lose, must be held accountable for terror, and not preside anywhere. Glory to all who are now in battle! I thank everyone who helps Ukraine. Who defends the international order based on rules! Thank you to everyone who saves and helps save our people after being injured by Russian shelling! Eternal memory to all adults and children whose lives were taken by the terror of Russia! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Rashism must face a total defeat: military, economic, political, legal - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-02</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Today, Russian terrorists again struck at Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region. At ordinary residential blocks. Six people were killed by this Russian shelling. Three women, three men. Ordinary people of an ordinary town in Donbas. My condolences to the family and friends of the deceased... Another 11 people were wounded. Russia used S-300 missiles and the Uragan MLRS against Kostiantynivka. This morning, Russian terrorists also attacked the Konotop district of the Sumy region. Mortar fire. Two people were killed. My condolences to all relatives, friends, all families... These are just a few examples of dozens of hits per day. There is only one way to stop Russian terror, to restore security to all our cities and communities - from Sumy region to Donbas, from Kharkiv region to Kherson region, from Kyiv region to Yalta. And this is Ukraine’s military victory. There is no other way and there will be no other way. The evil state for which it has become the norm to hit residential buildings with &quot;Uragan&quot; like this, to launch S-300 missiles at cities, to shell ordinary villages, people... The evil state must be defeated. In every sense of the word. Rashism must face a total defeat: military, economic, political, legal. The first point is military. And it will face it. I thank everyone who brings this time closer! I am grateful to our warriors who are fighting near Avdiivka, Maryinka, near Bakhmut... Especially Bakhmut! It&#x27;s especially hot there today! Near Bilohorivka, near Kreminna and all our other cities, towns and villages of Donbas! The resilience of everyone is the resilience of the whole of Ukraine, helping everyone in a position nearby is helping the whole of Ukraine! And I would especially like to mention the 77th separate airmobile brigade, the 67th and 92nd separate mechanized brigades, our paratroopers of the “Eightieth”, the 5th separate assault brigade... Thank you, guys! Marines of the 35th and 36th brigades, gunners of the 55th separate brigade, the 64th and 66th separate gun divisions of the 406th artillery brigade... Thank you, warriors! Thank you to everyone who protects Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, the direction of the Dnipropetrovsk region and Kharkiv, Sumy region and Chernihiv region... To everyone who protects our border. Who saves our people from injuries, from pain. Of course I would like to separately thank everyone who trains our warriors, as it is on powerful training that a successful combat result is based. Today, April 2, we celebrate the anniversary of the liberation of our Kyiv region from the rashist army. On April 2, the last occupier fled from the territory of the Kyiv region. There will be a day when we will say: the last occupier has fled or been killed in the Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Kherson region and in our entire south. Crimea will be free and safe again. Ukraine will return all its territories. Next week will be especially important for our defense, for our advancement towards victory. We are already preparing for scheduled events and decisions. The key thing now is to cherish our unity, take care of our defenders, help each other and the state. Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Every day we are getting stronger, every day we are getting closer to the day when the terrorist state will be held to account - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-03</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! A report on this busy day. Staff. Another away meeting of the Staff - the first was in Dnipro, now - in Chernihiv. Key security issues at the front, in the northern regions and at the border. The commanders of the directions delivered reports. This time, Generals Syrskyi and Tarnavskyi reported by secure communication line, and not in person, from the hottest areas of the front. The situation in Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Maryinka and throughout the Donetsk region. Bilohorivka and the entire Luhansk region. The Commander-in-Chief and the Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate, the Head of the State Border Guard Service, representatives of the Ministry of Defense. Full-fledged meeting. Full-fledged coordination. Full-fledged preparation of our active actions for the liberation of Ukrainian lands. There were many different events and negotiations in the Chernihiv region starting from this morning. One of the most difficult trips in terms of emotions. We visited Yahidne, an ordinary small village of our Chernihiv region, which Russian savages turned into one of the world&#x27;s biggest examples of human abuse last year. Russian soldiers made a command post at the school in Yahidne, and drove all the villagers into the basement of the school. Just like a human shield. From March 3 to March 30 of last year, the occupiers kept more than three hundred people in the basement of this school... An ordinary village school, the basement, which is smaller than two hundred square meters. Elderly people and little children, women and men... The oldest woman was 93 years old, the youngest child was less than six months old. We will never forgive the evil state for this basement, this concentration camp in Yahidne, just as for all other crimes of Russia against people and humanity. And not only us. The Kremlin will not be able to hide behind a chair in the UN Security Council, gas pipes or anything else. There will certainly be legal and fair responsibility for every Russian crime committed on Ukrainian soil. In the tribunal, in the International Criminal Court, in Ukrainian courts. I am grateful to the guests of Ukraine who visited the Chernihiv region with me, who saw this concentration of Russian evil in our Yahidne. I thank German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck and Secretary General of the Council of Europe Marija Pejčinović Burić. I am also thankful for the negotiations - meaningful and correct. I thank UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay for her attention to Ukraine, for today&#x27;s meetings in Ukraine. We are preparing the UNESCO World Heritage status for the historical center of Chernihiv. The same status that was recently obtained for the historical center of our Odesa. As always, it was a special honor to visit our warriors in the hospital, who are recovering from battle wounds. To thank them for everything they do for Ukraine, to thank them for their faith in Ukraine, which our people defend, risking the most valuable - their lives. I presented Chernihiv with the award of a hero city, a city of heroes. Chernihiv saw different occupiers, different kinds of evil... Protecting ourselves from this Russian evil is perhaps the most important thing in our history. I awarded our warriors who distinguished themselves in the defense of the state. And what is very important - I thanked everyone who ensures the reconstruction of our Chernihiv region. We will restore everything that the enemy destroyed. Ukraine will never be a country of ruins, no matter how much the Kremlin dreams of it. Their dreams do not come true. Already here, in Kyiv, after my return, I met with a delegation of American congressmen. I thanked America for its consistently powerful help, from President Biden and the White House team to both houses of Congress and the entire system of American power. We talked, of course, about the active actions of Ukraine. Of course, about our joint victory. I also met with Mike Pompeo, former United States Secretary of State I am grateful to everyone who helps us defend freedom! I am especially thankful today to Denmark and Norway for the initiative of the governments to transfer an additional batch of artillery shells to our warriors. This is very timely and useful. We are getting stronger every day. Every day we are getting closer to the day when the terrorist state will be held to account. Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine! May the memory of all those who gave their lives for Ukraine be blessed and eternal! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>The enemy of freedom must lose, that is why we ask the USA for support - speech by the President of Ukraine at an online meeting with members of the U.S. National Association of Governors</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-04</span></div>
  <p>Thanks for this opportunity! Ladies and Gentlemen! Ambassador! Dear representatives of the entire U.S. – from the east coast to the west coast. Actually all cities and communities in the United States are represented at this meeting, and it is an honor to address you all. I have just completed my visits to those regions of Ukraine that were liberated from the Russian army, or that are bordering the combat zone. This is a colossal territory. The line of active hostilities in Ukraine now is more than 1,200 kilometers long. It&#x27;s like from Washington, D.C., to Chicago and back! The total frontline is even more than that. Millions of people live in the cities and villages from which we have either already expelled the Russian flag or are preparing to do so. Think about this number – almost nineteen hundred cities and towns in my country need reconstruction. Schools and churches, residential buildings and enterprises, transport and power plants... All of you know very well what is to rebuild your life after a devastating tornado. You are doing it! We are doing it! But we are doing it because of the human element, human evil, and not a natural cataclysm. The reconstruction of Ukraine will be the largest economic project in Europe in lifetime of several generations. And I believe America will stand with us in this reconstruction! Your companies, your jobs... Just like you are with us now – in our defense. Ladies and Gentlemen! Who, if not you, state governors, know what is really behind the words &quot;reconstruction&quot; and &quot;defense&quot;. Russia unleashed this war not so much against our country, but against freedom in Europe and around the globe in general. And when asking why America should help Ukraine and invest in our defense, the answer is – just look at reality. Millions of Ukrainian families are torn by the war, millions are forced to seek protection from Russian terror in other countries. Hundreds of Ukrainian cities and villages have been burned by Russian artillery, missiles, aircrafts and Iranian drones used by Russia. There was a city... Vuhledar. Fifteen thousand inhabitants lived there. The aggressor burned it. Mariupol. More than four hundred thousand inhabitants lived there. Russia left only ruins from it. Thousands of fields are mined. A significant part of our economy is broken. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people have been forcibly deported to Russia... This is what the evil state has brought to Ukraine. And what if all this spreads further across Europe? Through the cities and lands of your allies... Those whom you have a sacred obligation to protect. How much will it cost America then? The Kremlin dreams to humiliate America and Europe and the whole free world. The Kremlin dreams to split NATO and to provoke a conflict that will force Your nation to choose whether to fight or not. It is Ukraine, that is your last frontier, your last reliable border. Thanks to our strength, in particular your people will not have to make this choice – a choice about your men and women – brave soldiers, whose lives would be laid on the Altar of protecting the most precious – freedom. One thousand two hundred kilometers of fighting in Ukraine. And how much more can there be in Europe? Ukraine is capable of preventing the expansion of the war. We are able to defeat Russia on our land. The enemy of freedom must lose – quickly and surely where he came with a criminal and unprovoked war of aggression. That is why we ask the USA for support, for weapons and finances. If Ukraine endures – your peace, your allies and partners endure as well. And I want to thank all Americans – each and every one, leaders and ordinary people who see this reality, who know how important it is to protect freedom now, who support Ukraine. We are grateful to President Biden, to both parties and houses of Congress, and to every state that is involved in one way or another in protecting freedom. Grateful to those who are ready to work with us in reconstruction. Thanks to all of you. Thanks to Arkansas and all employees of the defense industry of the state – for the excellent HIMARS systems, which really change the course of military actions and force the Russian army to the defense. Thank you, Alabama, and all the employees of the state&#x27;s enterprises that produce, in particular, Javelin anti-tank systems, which saved lives of thousands and thousands of Ukrainian soldiers. Thanks to Arizona and Oklahoma, where our military trained, in particular on the Patriots. Thanks to every US state involved in the production of the Patriots. &quot;Harpoons&quot; and &quot;Stingers&quot;, &quot;NASAMS&quot; and &quot;Bradley&quot;, other systems and products, – not only in the field of security, – also other services and solutions that bring Ukrainian victory closer, that give Ukrainians stability of a normal life despite the war, – are produced by you, by your states, your people. Texas and Nevada, Maryland and California, Indiana and Oregon, Washington and New York and many others... Each of the states already has experience helping us. Not only for defense, but also for our people, in particular in the treatment of soldiers and civilians – adults and children who were injured by Russian terrorist attacks and mine explosions. Hundreds and hundreds of American companies, banks and factories are already doing business with Ukraine. Thousands of companies will join our reconstruction project. From Pennsylvania and Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia, Missouri and Georgia, Connecticut and Colorado... I know that some states are negotiating special cooperation. The one, that is about recovery. Ohio and our Kharkiv region, Illinois and our Kyiv region, Minnesota and our Chernihiv region. We must expand this direction of cooperation – from state to region, from city to city. Something that will powerfully complement interstate work. It is with Ukraine that America has the opportunity to protect its values, which match ours. And also – our cooperation creates new growth for our security and yours, for our economy and yours, for jobs – in both our countries. The main thing is not to waste time, not to lose the chance we have. To act now, and help now. The Ukrainians do it so that the Americans do not have to fight. Together, we are gaining new strength of our nations. And I am sure that we will always be successful. Thanks for your attention! Thank you, America for the help that lets us win! I invite you, who have not yet been to Ukraine, to visit our country. And to see that protecting our home, our people – is protecting our common dream about freedom and dignity for every human being. By the way, governor Murphy who visited Lviv region last February can confirm – we are a hospitable nation and we always welcome guests who visit us with an open heart. God bless America! Слава Україні!</p>

  <h2>Russian aggression proves that only collective preventive security guarantees can be reliable - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-04</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I have just addressed the Parliament of Chile - another country that heard Ukraine, heard what we are striving for. It does not matter what the distance is between our nations. We equally value life and defend the international order. We must deprive rashism of even the hope of support in Latin America. I also addressed the governors of the US states - this is the first time that I delivered such a special address to the representatives of each state elected by the citizens. I thanked them for their support, emphasized how we, together with America, can not only win the ongoing battle, but also prove that freedom and cooperation always restore normal life after the strikes of aggression. I also had several international conversations with our partners today. I thanked Canada and Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau personally for the unwavering support. For another manifestation of it - financial assistance in the amount of 2 billion 400 million Canadian dollars, which our budget has already received. The situation on the battlefield and the security needs of our country were discussed in detail. In order to drive the enemy out of our land faster and thereby end this war faster, we need to mobilize the world, our partners, all the peoples who do not agree with the chaos that Russian aggression is bringing to the world even more. I spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, Mrs. President of the European Commission. Our steps in European integration, our joint measures that we are preparing... The new sanctions package of the European Union, which must continue the line of pressure on Russia, pressure to reduce its terrorist potential, its threat. Today, by the way, a historic event took place for our region, for all of Europe, for the entire Euro-Atlantic community. Finland becomes the 31st member of NATO. The alliance is getting stronger on the eastern flank. I congratulate all the people of Finland and Mr. President personally on a reliable security guarantee - a collective guarantee. Russian aggression clearly proves that only collective guarantees, only preventive guarantees can be reliable. That&#x27;s what we always talked about. We also talked about speed - the speed of security decisions matters. Now we can see how fast the procedures can be. By the way, this year&#x27;s NATO Summit in Vilnius deserves to be quite ambitious. The more ambitious the one who protects freedom, the less opportunities for aggression the one who wants evil has. The day will come when security will be guaranteed for our country as well. I am constantly in touch with our commanders who are confronting the evil state on the battlefield. A special format of our military meeting was held today. General Syrskyi - regarding Bakhmut, Commander-in-Chief, Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate - regarding the overall military situation. The Ministry of Defense - regarding the supply of ammunition and everything else according to the needs of our defenders. Decisions are already being implemented. We have also been preparing all day for the international events planned for this week. They are important, brave, ambitious. As it is a rule for Ukraine. We also keep the internal situation under control, in particular regarding spiritual independence. We also guarantee it. No one will succeed in breaking Ukraine - neither from the outside nor from the inside. I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! Avdiivka and Bakhmut, Maryinka and Krasnohorivka, every hot direction... I thank you, warriors! Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! I would like to highlight two decisions today. The U.S. is providing a $2.6 billion defense support package. Ammunition for HIMARS, for air defense, for artillery is just what we need. Thank you Mr. President Biden, thank you Congress, thank you every American! And the second decision. Today, the work of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Russian crimes against Ukrainians has been extended. Each such international legal step brings the Rashists closer to inevitable, fair responsibility. Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Such a war as Russia is currently waging against Ukraine cannot be the norm - President&#x27;s speech at a joint meeting of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies of the National Congress of Chile</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-04</span></div>
  <p>Mr. President of the Senate, Mr. President of the Chamber of Deputies... Thank you for your words, for such a kind greeting. I see our flag in your hall. Thank you for respecting our flag, our anthem, my country! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear members of the National Congress of Chile, dear representatives of the diplomatic corps, dear journalists! Chilean people! Let me begin my appeal with a story. A story about a place where children drew. Ordinary children, but not ordinary drawings... On the walls. At school. In the basement. In the village of Yahidne in our Chernihiv region, where Russian soldiers turned an ordinary village school into a concentration camp. They drove all the inhabitants of the village there. Everyone! To the basement. Children and adults. Very old people. Women and men. Less than two hundred square meters for more than three hundred and sixty people. Maybe you haven&#x27;t heard of this place yet. But I want to tell you about it. To tell about the walls of this basement in Yahidne, on which children drew what any children in any country draw. Friends, relatives, their life, their dreams, football players, their other heroes. The children tried to write the lines of our national anthem, which you just played here, the lines of the national anthem on the walls... And the adults kept count. Also on the walls. How many days passed in that basement and how many people died, unable to withstand such conditions. Their names are still on those walls. I was there yesterday, I saw it all. From the third to the thirtieth of March last year, there was a concentration camp in Yahidne. At the beginning, people were still allowed to go outside. One at a time. Sometimes. At least to the toilet. And then they were deprived of this too - not a single minute of sun and sky. The darkness of the basement, crowding, dust and a bucket instead of a toilet. We definitely know about ten people who died there. People just couldn&#x27;t endure it. We also know about those who were executed later in the village, who went missing. And I don&#x27;t want to talk publicly now about what the occupiers started doing when people said that the dead should be buried. It was hell on earth. The hell that came to Ukraine with the Russian army. Perhaps somewhere on your continent, in some countries, there are still positive or nostalgic memories of the period of relations with the Soviet Union or of the Russia that it pretended to be after 1991... But now this concentration camp in Yahidne characterizes who we are dealing with. Why was such mockery of people necessary? What could be the motive to keep the entire village in inhumane conditions in the basement for three weeks? This is a fascism of the 21st century. It acts like that. This is a dictatorship. It does that. And when we turn to partners for weapons, we turn exclusively for protection. And our warriors managed to liberate almost nineteen hundred Ukrainian cities and villages from Russian occupation. Yahidne is among them. Many villages, towns and cities have gone through even worse torture. They were simply burned. Imagine a once strong village, for example, Posad-Pokrovske, Kherson region of Ukraine, in which more than two thousand people lived, but now almost all the houses are broken. To be precise - 96% were damaged by shelling. Russia came there! Imagine when there are fifty more such villages almost completely destroyed by the war in one region only. Imagine a city that for decades was famous for its industry, its seaport... And now the city is dead. Killed by Russia. This is our Mariupol. Imagine one of the greatest Ukrainian values, one of the greatest human values – fertile fields that have provided prosperity for centuries. In the south of our country, in the east as well. Fields that are now contaminated by Russian mines. Often unexploded Russian MLRS rockets stick out of this land. Reminding that there can be no justification for the aggression of one state against another. Ladies and Gentlemen! Chilean people! We must liberate from Russian evil almost nineteen hundred Ukrainian towns and villages more! It is for this reason that we created a coalition of countries that help Ukraine defend our national independence and the lives of our people. It is for this reason that I proposed the Peace Formula last fall - ten points capable of returning security to Ukraine, and to the whole of Europe and the whole world - returning the stability disrupted by Russian fascism. It is for this reason that we appeal to you, the Chilean people, for support. Life has the same value everywhere. The highest value. There is nothing that can justify the destruction of the lives of peaceful people, the humiliation of peaceful people, the subjugation of free nations and the predatory attacks on other states for profit. I am grateful to you, the Republic of Chile, for the principled condemnation of Russian aggression, for supporting the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly. I am grateful to Mr. President of Chile, Mr. Boric, for the very important agreements reached on the participation of your country in the humanitarian demining of our land. This is what the 174,000 square kilometers of our territory, contaminated by Russian mines, need. We are forming a global coalition to accomplish this and other similar tasks. And I am sure that we will fulfill them. Burning cities and villages cannot be the norm anywhere in the world. Torture chambers, which someone wants to use to keep people in subjection, cannot be the norm. Concentration or filtration camps, where people are driven into... and where people die, cannot be the norm. Such a war as Russia is currently waging against Ukraine cannot be the norm. And therefore, Russia itself, as it has become, cannot and will not be the norm. This is a fascist state, a terrorist state, an evil state. A state that deserves to be treated by the world like a criminal - quite legally and fairly. Chilean people! Ukraine invites you to join our peacemaking efforts. Your vote at the UN in support of the restoration of security and territorial integrity of Ukraine is always, always very important. Your participation in the implementation of the points of our Peace Formula - and it may not only be humanitarian demining - will definitely add strength to the rules-based international order. I invite you to support our efforts for world food security. This is something that depends on the joint actions of all countries! Due to the fact that huge areas of our land are contaminated by mines or are in the zone of shelling... Due to the fact that Russia is blocking our ports and sea transportation in the Black Sea... The food market is destabilized. We managed to unblock part of the supply. But the world needs more. Just so that market volumes and food prices on all continents are stable. You can be the leader of stabilization efforts from your continent! Please support the efforts of the International Criminal Court, which recently issued an arrest warrant for the Russian dictator. In the case of the forcible deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and attempts to destroy their identity through assimilation and illegal adoption. When relatives are alive! There is no such crime that Russia has not yet committed while waging this war. And there is no such nation that could remain indifferent or neutral to such evil. Because we are all people. We all want the children of our nations to be happy and safe. To study and enjoy life, not draw on the walls in captivity, in basements and camps. I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! May dictatorship always lose, and life always prevail! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Russia cannot win in Europe when a Ukrainian and a Pole stand side by side - speech by the President of Ukraine before the deputies of both chambers of the National Assembly, representatives of the public of Ukraine and Poland</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-05</span></div>
  <p>Greetings, Warsaw! Greetings, Poland! Great Polish people! Great Ukrainian people! Side by side here - united on this square, by the spirit of freedom, great history and glorious victory, which we are bringing closer together! We know each other, Ukrainians and Poles, and have known each other for a long time. And now, in the heart of the Polish capital, Ukrainian hearts turn to each of the Polish hearts. It is an honor for me to be here. I speak to you with words of gratitude and strength. Gratitude, because there are no such moments anymore when we would be divided, when we would not be united. Ukrainian and Polish hearts are fighting for one freedom, for the mutual independence of our states, for our native Europe - our common home, and we will be victorious! There is no such force that would prevail over the Ukrainian and Polish brotherhood. And this will make the following words come true: &quot;What a foreign force has taken from us, we shall take back with a saber.&quot; We will prevail, brothers, everywhere, on our side. Every time the Ukrainian flag returns to its absolutely legal place on Ukrainian soil, and the Russian occupier flees, the Polish flag also gets stronger. Yellow-blue and white-red - these four colors are stronger than the enemy&#x27;s tricolor. Every successful battle of Ukrainian heroes for our independent state adds protection to Polish independence. Polish &quot;Krabs&quot; and &quot;Pioruns&quot; in the hands of Ukrainians, who return freedom to our people, reinforce your freedom as well. This is what our ability, Ukrainians and Poles, to build our victorious history side by side means. And I am grateful for this brotherhood to every Pole! Bow to you, Poland! Applause for you, Polish people! I am grateful to you, friend Andrzej, Mr. President. To your wife Agata. I am honored to be here today with my wife. Thank you, dear Mateusz, Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you, Mrs. Marshal and Mr. Marshal. To all Polish leaders here in Warsaw and everywhere in the communes, and to the people of Poland who know what our freedom means to your freedom. I am grateful to all of you who are now on this square and who hear me all over Poland! Today, I was on Marszałek Piłsudski Square, next to the place where the words of a great man and a great Pole, John Paul II, were spoken in 1979. Turning to God, he said: &quot;May Your Spirit descend and renew the face of the earth! Of this land!&quot; Today it is obvious how generous the Lord was when he heard these words. Free Poland has risen and will never fall. Free Ukraine has risen and will never fall. The foreign power, which sought to control our people and did not understand what we were striving for, simply fell apart. And we - we stand together! Side by side. Ukraine and Poland, and Europe, and the free world. We stand when the full-scale forces of aggression are thrown again against our freedom. Well, this regime, which unleashed a war against us, will also fall. It brought graves to Ukraine, so that later he would bring graves again to Poland, and to all our brothers and sisters of free Europe. And we are fighting. Side by side! It brought deportations to Ukrainians in order to deport others again, whose freedom breathes on the lands that Russia is going to steal. And we defend ourselves. Side by side! The enemy wanted to bury our independence and to dissolve our national cultures in the Russian space. And we stand strong! You and us, Ukrainians and Poles, together, side by side, will return all this evil with an epitaph to Russian imperialism. You and us, Poland, side by side will establish freedom in Europe forever. Tyranny will lose in history when it loses in Ukraine. Moscow will not kill, and Petersburg will not divide. Never again. On this glorious square and on any other Polish square, as well as on all Ukrainian maidans, there will never be Russia again - after our victory. Are there still many steps to it? No. It is only necessary not to stop in solidarity. When a battle requires artillery, it should be provided. When victory requires tanks, their roar must be heard on the frontline. When independence needs air, you shouldn’t pay attention to how Russia will react to our planes, you shouldn’t guess which number will look safer next to the letter F - 16 or some other. You should take action! Take action in the same way as your leadership manifested itself in the tank coalition, I believe that it will also manifest itself in the aviation coalition. Because this is a battle for freedom, and it is impossible to win it partially. When our ally, a powerful ally of freedom, President Biden spoke in Warsaw recently, he said: “There is no sweeter word than freedom. There is no nobler goal than freedom. There is no higher aspiration than freedom.&quot; We, Ukrainians and Poles, are well aware of this. Therefore, there is no such issue between us that we will not solve in order to strengthen our common defense. Therefore, this visit of mine, negotiations here in Warsaw, became another step towards victory. And I thank you for the decisions approved today! For a powerful defense package. Thank you for the lives that we save with our solidarity together! Dear Polish people! I am sure you know that solidarity now covers much more than the fate of our two peoples. When you and us are free, it is a guarantee that freedom will be strong in all our countries - neighbors in the European Union. Romania and Slovakia, Lithuania and other Baltic countries... Everyone is stronger when we are free. When we are free, it is a guarantee that freedom will endure in Moldova, will not leave Georgia and will come... will definitely come to Belarus. The more freedom we have around us, the more guarantees justice will have. That our common enemy will be held to account. Will be held to account justly - for Bykivnia and Bucha, for Katyn and Smolensk. Will be held to account to the end of his life here on earth, and forever before God. Justice will be the historical achievement of our generations, and the way is also paved by our brotherhood. By Ukrainians and Poles walking side by side. Polish brothers and sisters! Just a few generations ago, everything on which our power is now based was just a task. Jerzy Giedroyc taught that &quot;there is no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine.&quot; This is learned. And I would continue: Russia cannot win in Europe when a Ukrainian and a Pole stand side by side. Let&#x27;s learn it. And just as you and us, Poland, stand together in this war, we will also enjoy peace. Together! Side by side in everything. Together in the European Union, together in NATO. This is the continuation of our destiny of free nations! We must bolster the historical understanding between our peoples with everything. Everything! Everything that we have to solve for the interests and peace of our societies must be solved. From military and political, economic and energy cooperation to the painstaking work of historians. When we accept that human life is the highest value, we honor the memory and dignity of every person. Everyone who lived before us. Everyone who requires respect. And there should be no prohibitions here... It is our mutual and absolute respect that will bring Ukrainian and Polish culture to the world. Always! Because we were saved forever by our unity, our resolve. Dear Rzeszów! I thank you for becoming the first rescuer city for Ukraine! Przemyśl! Lublin! Chełm! Thank you! For reaching out to our people at a time when it was most needed! Gdańsk and Wrocław! Katowice and Białystok! Kraków and Warsaw! Every city in Poland that has become so hospitable to our people! I thank you! Thank you for the fact that Ukrainian children in Poland can live in respect, and Ukrainian adults received a law from the Polish state that guarantees them the same rights and opportunities that your people have! Thank you to all the volunteers of Poland - you can make it louder for the volunteers - who help our people here, on Polish soil, and in Ukraine, even risking their lives! Thank you to everyone who trains Ukrainian soldiers on Polish soil! And I thank every Polish heart that speaks its prayers for Ukrainians as well! Dear Ukrainians in Poland! We work every day to expel the enemy from Ukraine, to restore security to all our cities and villages, so that our people who have found refuge in other countries can return home. And I thank all of you who help the state! Dear Poles! All Europeans! I wish you happy upcoming Easter holidays! And I wish everyone a victory of life over aggression, a victory in the battles that are taking place now in Ukraine! Glory to all our warriors who are fighting for our freedom! Слава Україні! Chwała Polsce!</p>

  <h2>The defense and protection of our people, the support of warriors is the number one issue at all negotiations - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-06</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today, I’m already in Ukraine, in Kyiv, here, on Bankova the whole day. A day of internal meetings and preparations for events planned for the coming weeks. I held a meeting with Prime Minister Shmyhal. More on current issues. Coordination of state actions, decisions. A meeting on the security situation, the work of law enforcement agencies. Our international agenda – the preparation of meetings, negotiations, appeals. As always, I was in touch with the military: everything related to the hottest areas of the frontline. It is very important that the content of the visit to Poland, the work of our delegation in Warsaw and in constant communication with Polish partners should be tangible for our front. Defense and protection of our people, maintenance of our resilience, primarily the resilience of warriors, is the number one issue at all negotiations and meetings. Exactly defense – weapons for Ukraine, ammunition for Ukraine, new defense systems for Ukraine. And I thank Poland, I thank our partners for making this visit truly meaningful. I would like to separately mention the meeting that took place very late yesterday evening, almost at night. Meeting with mayors of Polish cities, rescuer cities for Ukraine and Ukrainians. Rzeszów, Przemyśl, Lublin and Chełm. We met precisely in Chełm - together with Mr. Morawiecki, the Prime Minister of Poland. I thanked the entire community of rescuer cities, everyone who helped Ukrainians, who really proved in the very first days of a full-scale war that there are no barriers, borders, obstacles between Ukrainian and Polish hearts. Ukraine knows how to be grateful. Grateful for such solidarity - historical solidarity. Today, as always, there are some of our divisions worth celebrating. Paratroopers of the &quot;Eightieth&quot; and fighters of the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade... the 30th separate mechanized brigade... The firmness of your defense, guys, and resilience are inspiring. Powerfully inspiring. Inspiring the world not to lose momentum in supporting Ukraine. Thank you, warriors! The 35th and 36th separate marine infantry brigades, warriors of the &quot;Zaporizka Sich&quot; 55th separate artillery brigade... As always, well done. As always, they strive for greater results.

  <h2>The world should know: respect and order will return to international relations only when the Ukrainian flag returns to Crimea – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-07</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! Today was a busy day. First, the meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The main focus is on the battles for Avdiyivka and Bakhmut, for Luhansk region, for each of those directions where the enemy is trying to break the defense of the whole of Ukraine. And I thank every soldier, sergeant, officer, and general who stands against it. Those who gain stability for Ukraine – for the whole state – right there, in the battles at the hottest spots of the frontline. The task force commanders, the Commander-in-Chief, and intelligence reported at the meeting of the Staff. Separately – training of new brigades. Supply of ammunition and weapons to the troops. Second, the NSDC staff, together with the Government, together with ministries, is preparing a new potent list of sanctions against persons who work for aggression. They will be blocked. Third, I held a long meeting devoted to energy, both strategic issues – the development and protection of our energy system under any conditions, and current issues – the energy supply of our people and Ukrainian business. Fourth, we are adding a new tradition of respect to the official life of our state. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims in Ukraine and the Muslim community of the world – different countries, different nations – observe a strict fast during the holy month of Ramadan. When the sun sets, the Iftar dinner takes place. In Ukraine, it is respected everywhere, and even at the frontline, even in combat conditions. The Crimean Tatar people respect Ramadan... Respect should always be mutual. Therefore, starting this year, such a special event of respect will be held annually in Ukraine with the participation of the Head of State. And today for the first time – in the Crimean Tatar cultural center. The world should know: respect and order will return to international relations only when the Ukrainian flag returns to Crimea, when there is freedom there – just like everywhere else in Ukraine. I had the honor to reward our soldiers, Ukrainian Muslims, who are fighting together with everyone in the defense forces of Ukraine. I had the honor of sharing Iftar with our soldiers, representatives of the Mejlis, and the entire Ukrainian Muslim community. And I want to thank everyone in the big world Muslim community who supports our principle – the principle that no one is allowed to destroy the peace with aggression, which is given to everyone on Earth equally by God, who values every nation as much as we do in Ukraine. And fifth. Today, I signed several decrees on awarding state awards to our soldiers. 771 fighters. Soldiers of mechanized brigades, assault brigades, ground defense brigades, our anti-aircraft fighters, tactical aviation, artillery, reconnaissance battalions, engineering brigades, tankers. During the full-scale war, totally over 43,500 of our defenders were awarded state awards. I thank everyone who defends the state! Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine! And I congratulate everyone who celebrates the Annunciation today! We pray for the victory of our soldiers and the salvation of all our people from the evil of occupation! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>Nice to end this week with good results for Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-08</span></div>
  <p>Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health! It is nice to end this week with good results for the country – concerning weapons, international support, expanding our ties with the world, and our movement toward NATO. The most important thing these days is, of course, the visit to Poland, our agreements, and our achievements. Poland has implemented everything declared regarding tanks – they are in Ukraine, in particular, Leopard tanks. There are new agreements regarding infantry fighting vehicles – more than a hundred vehicles; as for armored personnel carriers Rosomak, two hundred vehicles: one hundred now, and one hundred later; also self-propelled mortars, additional missiles, MiG fighter jets. By the way, we also have important agreements regarding the economy, regarding the recovery of Ukraine – in particular, for our Kharkiv region. At the level of the first ladies of Ukraine and Poland, there are various humanitarian and medical projects. In particular, it is the training of our doctors in complex assistance to patients with burns and emergency air evacuation of the wounded, in particular, in war zones. Dozens of our doctors have already undergone or are currently undergoing such training. The project will continue – training in rehabilitation and training of Ukrainian psychologists. That is, in this struggle for life and freedom, we are really side by side with our Polish brothers and sisters. In all areas! I thank you for such constant, diverse, and large-scale support! There is also a new – already thirty-fifth – defense package from the United States. Missiles for HIMARS systems, missiles for anti-aircraft defense, shells for artillery, for protection against armored vehicles, and other important support elements. Thank you, America! This week, German support for Ukraine increased by EUR 200 million in investments in our country. In particular, these are projects of German companies that will help our economic and, therefore, social sustainability. Thank you, Germany! The Netherlands announced a package of over EUR 270 million. It is to help us in recovery, humanitarian, non-lethal support for defense, and – it is very important – support for justice. To collect evidence of Russian crimes, to create a Register of Damage caused by Russian aggression. I&#x27;m thankful to the Netherlands for being together in all areas of life protection! Denmark and Norway are working on a joint package of ammunition support for our artillery. Thanks for that! There are new sanctions decisions – from Australia and New Zealand. Thanks for them! I continued appealing to the parliaments of the world. For the first time, I addressed the parliament in Latin America – the Chilean parliament. In fact, the values we are all fighting for here in Ukraine are relevant for every nation, regardless of whether they are geographically far from us, from our people. Everyone values security and protection from terror. There is no such nation that would gladly accept what the Russian occupation has brought – Russian concentration camps, the deportation of our children, the rape of women, the burning of cities... The more the world knows about Russian aggression, the faster the aggressor will lose, and peace – will return. It will return not only to Ukraine. It will return to everyone in the world. Thank you, Chile for your support! A very important decision was made this week in Lithuania – regarding the main expectations from the NATO summit, which is planned in Vilnius. The Lithuanian Seimas recognized the need to invite Ukraine to become a member of NATO – to invite it this year, at the summit in Vilnius. I thank the Lithuanian people and all Lithuanian politicians for understanding the current security situation in Europe. Only together with Ukraine the Alliance will guarantee real protection for Europe against any encroachments on the peoples&#x27; lives, existing borders, and international order based on rules. And without Ukraine, it is hard to imagine strength. This decision of the Lithuanian Seimas will have a continuation in the coming weeks and months. We are already working on it. Of course, thanks to our soldiers. To everyone! The Armed Forces of Ukraine and border guards, National Guard and police, intelligence, and SSU, State Special Communications and State Emergency Service... Everyone who is currently in battle. Who defends the sky. Who gives Ukraine cyber defense and protects communication. Everyone who defends our border. Who trains our new brigades. Who eliminates the consequences of strikes, who saves our people from injuries, who prepares sentences for the occupiers. Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Thanks to all partners for the potent help! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We must be sure that evil will lose, we must bring the defeat of evil closer, and we are bringing it closer - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-09</span></div>
  <p>Ukrainians! Tonight, the Russian army shelled Zaporizhzhia with S-300 missiles. They hit a house, an apartment building. Three people were inside. A man, a woman and a child - a girl, her name was Iryna, she would have turned 11 this year. She died. The man died too. My condolences... The woman is in critical condition, in the hospital, she is being provided with medical care. This is how the terrorist state spends this Palm Sunday. This is how Russia puts itself in even greater isolation from the world, from humanity. Every bright Christian holiday teaches us that we may not know how, but we must be sure that evil will lose. We have to believe. And we believe. We must bring the defeat of evil closer. And we are bringing it closer. And the world stands with us. Every month, every week, support is increased, the circle of those who support us, who support our grit and our faith in life, increases. I thank everyone in the world who is with Ukraine now, who is with us in deed. I thank all our people who are eliminating the consequences of Russian shelling and helping those who have suffered from terror. In Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Kherson region, Donbas. I am grateful to every rescuer and doctor, every nurse, every sapper, every policeman... All representatives of local authorities in cities and villages who help people. And volunteers. And of course, I want to thank the warriors! Everyone who is currently in battle. Everyone who repels Russian evil. Everyone who destroys the occupiers - in battle and in their rear. We are preparing for an active new week, in particular in our international activities, to strengthen the defense, to strengthen our warriors. And based on the results of this week, I would like to especially celebrate the marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, warriors of the 55th artillery brigade... They are fighting in the Donetsk region. Efficiently. Thank you guys! I thank the warriors of the assault company of the 783rd regiment of the State Special Transport Service, the warriors of the 5th separate assault brigade and the 80th separate airborne assault brigade for the active assault actions in Bakhmut and in the Bakhmut direction... Well done, guys! Slovyansk direction - the 30th separate mechanized brigade... Also active assault actions. Thank you guys! I thank the warriors of the 66th separate mechanized brigade and the 95th airborne assault brigade for their steadfastness and grit in the Lyman direction. I am thankful to the intelligence units that are fighting in the hottest areas of the frontline! Border guards of the Luhansk and Kramatorsk detachments, combined units of the Lviv, Donetsk, Mohyliv-Podilskyi and Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi detachments... Thank you, guys! Special forces, the 50th National Guard regiment... Thank you! Zaporizhzhia direction - I will separately mention the warriors of the 39th anti-aircraft missile regiment. Well done, guys! Accuracy is the main thing. And thank you to all the fighters of the Air Defense Forces and the Air Forces who reliably protect our sky! Glory to all Ukrainian heroes! To everyone who is now in battle! To everyone who is currently in combat positions or fulfilling missions! Eternal and bright memory to all those who gave their lives protecting the lives of Ukraine and Ukrainians! May next year&#x27;s Palm Sunday pass in peace and freedom for all our people! May the sincere prayers for peace of all who celebrate Easter today be heard! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are now at such a stage of the war, when it is important not to lose a sense of the path we have to overcome - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-11</span></div>
  <p>Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! I held a regular meeting of the Staff today. First of all, we considered the combat situation, what we manage to succeed in in the main directions, in difficult directions, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka, the Donetsk region in general, such as Kreminna and the Luhansk region in general. We also considered at the Staff meeting what we are yet to succeed in. What we are working on. There were reports by General Syrskyi, General Tarnavskyi, the Commander-in-Chief, the Main Intelligence Directorate. The General Staff and the Minister of Internal Affairs reported on the staffing of new units of our defense forces - new brigades. Head of the Security Service, General Malyuk made a report on his part - on what concerns our internal resilience, protection from the internal enemy and counteraction to collaborators. We are now at such a stage of the war, when it is important for our society and partners not to lose a sense of the path we have to overcome. Precisely the path. The path that’s ahead. Compared to last year, it’s quieter in many places now. But this does not mean that somewhere you can ignore the war or be less focused on helping the state. We managed to do a lot together with our partners to protect people, Ukraine, and the whole of Europe. But this doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s time to rest on our laurels. The path is ahead. The movement is ahead. Something that requires no less unity from us than before. No less focus than before. Just as before, our positions at the front, all our warriors in their positions must be supported by Ukrainian positions politically and informationally, by the power of weapons and the power of our social unity, by our internal resilience and the strength of Ukraine&#x27;s ties with the world. And this is the task of both the state and everyone in the state, of both Ukraine and everyone in the world who values a free life and an international order based on rules. It is unwise to just passively hope that someone else will bring victory, the one who is now in the trenches, who is now in the assaults. This is a common task. Victory is gained by everyone. By those who fight for it and those who give weapons. By those who reduce the capabilities of the terrorist state and those who increase the capabilities of Ukraine. Just as everyone in the Staff is responsible for their part of the defense of the state, on the path to victory everyone should understand what their steps to victory are. And whether these steps are enough to complete the entire path. Today I had a very interesting, meaningful meeting with American businessman and philanthropist Howard Buffett. He has been generously helping Ukraine and our people for a long time. Many projects are implemented with his support. For example, construction of a kitchen factory has begun in Bucha, which will become part of the school meals reform in Ukraine and will provide for children in three communities of the Kyiv region. This project will also be scaled to other regions, in particular to the Kharkiv region. And when a person helps so much, when he personally cares about support - and these are projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars - such a person sees very well how important it is for everyone to be on the path to victory, how important it is for everyone to be active, how important it is for everyone to become a hero at least in a certain way so that we all win. I thank Mr. Buffett for his support. I am thankful to all our partners in the world who remain active in helping. Thank you to all Ukrainian men and women who understand that we have to walk this path together - to victory, and in true unity, supporting each other and the state. Glory to all our warriors! Glory to our strong people! Glory to Ukraine!</p>

  <h2>We are not going to forget anything and forgive the murderers; there will be legal responsibility for everything - address by the President of Ukraine</h2>
  <div class="badges"><span class="chip">EN</span> <span class="chip">2023-04-12</span></div>
  <p>There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill. This video... The execution of a Ukrainian captive… The world must see it. This is a video of Russia as it is. What kind of creatures they are. There are no people for them. A son, a brother, a husband… Someone’s child… This is a video of Russia trying to make just that the new norm. Such a habit of destroying life. This is not an accident. This is not an episode. This was the case earlier. This was the case in Bucha. Thousands of times. Everyone must react. Every leader. Don&#x27;t expect it to be forgotten. That time will pass. We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers. There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary. No one will understand if the leaders don&#x27;t react. Action is required now! And we in Ukraine must focus on the frontline as much as possible. Help as much as possible. Expel the occupier from our land! The main goal is to win. The main goal is strength for Ukraine to win. Defeat of the occupier, sentences to murderers, Tribunal for the evil state. Eternal memory to every person whose life was taken by Russian terror! Glory to all who fight against this evil! Glory to Ukraine!</p>
