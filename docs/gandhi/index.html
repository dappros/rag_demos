            <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
                <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0;">Swaraj (Self-Rule)</h3>
                <p>Gandhi's central concept of self-rule, encompassing both political independence and personal self-discipline. 
                He believed that true freedom comes from within and that individuals must first rule themselves before 
                they can govern others.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">Satyagraha (Truth Force)</h3>
                <p>Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance, based on the power of truth and love. This method of 
                social change became the foundation of India's independence movement and influenced civil rights 
                movements worldwide.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">Swadeshi (Self-Reliance)</h3>
                <p>Gandhi's advocacy for economic self-reliance and the use of local products. He promoted spinning 
                and weaving as symbols of independence and as practical means of economic empowerment for rural India.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">Hindu-Muslim Unity</h3>
                <p>Gandhi's lifelong commitment to fostering unity between India's Hindu and Muslim communities. 
                He believed that religious harmony was essential for India's independence and progress.</p>
