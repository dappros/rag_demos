# üß† Ethora RAG Demos

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demos built with [Ethora](https://ethora.com), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com).  
> Quickly learn how to build knowledge-based AI assistants that can index your own website or documents.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains practical examples showing how to connect **Ethora‚Äôs AI chat widget and backend tools** with RAG pipelines.  
Each demo is designed to help developers understand how to:

- Crawl and index web pages or documents  
- Store embeddings in a vector database  
- Retrieve relevant chunks based on user queries  
- Use LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to generate contextual answers  
- Serve the results via Ethora‚Äôs chat component or WordPress plugin

You can use these demos as templates for your own **AI assistants**, **knowledge bases**, or **support chatbots**.
