# üß† Ethora RAG Demos

> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demos built with [Ethora](https://ethora.com), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com).  
> Quickly learn how to build knowledge-based AI assistants that can index your own website or documents.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains practical examples showing how to connect **Ethora‚Äôs AI chat widget and backend tools** with RAG pipelines.  
Each demo is designed to help developers understand how to:

- Crawl and index web pages or documents  
- Store embeddings in a vector database  
- Retrieve relevant chunks based on user queries  
- Use LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to generate contextual answers  
- Serve the results via Ethora‚Äôs chat component or WordPress plugin

You can use these demos as templates for your own **AI assistants**, **knowledge bases**, or **support chatbots**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dappros/rag_demos.git
cd rag_demos
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Set your API keys (for example, OpenAI):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Run any demo:

```bash
python demos/basic_rag_openai.py
```

You can also index your website before running:

```bash
python ../site_crawler/crawl.py https://yourwebsite.com
```

Then query your knowledge base using the chat widget or CLI interface.

## üí¨ Connect to Ethora Chat Widget

Once you have a RAG backend running, you can embed it into any website:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ethora-chat-component@latest/dist/widget.js"></script>
<script>
  EthoraChatWidget.init({
    endpoint: "https://your-server/api/rag",
    title: "Ask our AI Assistant",
  });
</script>
```

You can also use the [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/dappros/ethora-wp-plugin) for no-code integration.
